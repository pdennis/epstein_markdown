948.101 Terms and conditions of community control and criminal quarantine community control.

(1) The court shall determine the terms and conditions of community control. Conditions specified in this subsection do not require oral pronouncement at the time of sentencing and may be considered standard conditions of community control.

(a) The court shall require intensive supervision and surveillance for an offender placed into community control, which may include but is not limited to:

1. Specified contact with the parole and probation officer.
2. Confinement to an agreed-upon residence during hours away from employment and public service activities.
3. Mandatory public service.
4. Supervision by the Department of Corrections by means of an electronic monitoring device or system.
5. The standard conditions of probation set forth in s. 948.03.

(b) For an offender placed on criminal quarantine community control, the court shall require:

1. Electronic monitoring 24 hours per day.
2. Confinement to a designated residence during designated hours.

(2) The enumeration of specific kinds of terms and conditions does not prevent the court from adding thereto any other terms or conditions that the court considers proper. However, the sentencing court may only impose a condition of supervision allowing an offender convicted of s. 794.011, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, or s. 847.0145 to reside in another state if the order stipulates that it is contingent upon the approval of the receiving state interstate compact authority. The court may rescind or modify at any time the terms and conditions theretofore imposed by it upon the offender in community control. However, if the court withholds adjudication of guilt or imposes a period of incarceration as a condition of community control, the period may not exceed 364 days, and incarceration shall be restricted to a county facility, a probation and restitution center under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, a probation program drug punishment phase I secure residential treatment institution, or a community residential facility owned or operated by any entity providing such services.

(3) The court may place a defendant who is being sentenced for criminal transmission of HIV in violation of s. 775.0877 on criminal quarantine community control. The Department of Corrections shall develop and administer a criminal quarantine community control program emphasizing intensive supervision with 24-hour-per-day electronic monitoring. Criminal quarantine community control status must include surveillance and may include other measures normally associated with community control, except that specific conditions necessary to monitor this population may be ordered.

control of, or under the supervision of, the Department of Corrections, or is not in the custody of a private correctional facility.

Any change in the sexual offender's permanent or temporary residence, name, any electronic mail address and any instant message name required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (4)(d), after the sexual offender reports in person at the sheriff's office, shall be accomplished in the manner provided in subsections (4), (7), and (8).

1. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home, as defined in chapter 320, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department through the sheriff's office written notice of the vehicle identification number; the license tag number; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat, as defined in chapter 327, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department written notice of the hull identification number; the manufacturer's serial number; the name of the vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat.

2.

Each change in enrollment or employment status shall be reported in person at the sheriff's office, within 48 hours after any change in status. The sheriff shall promptly notify each institution of the sexual offender's presence and any change in the sexual offender's enrollment or employment status.

When a sexual offender reports at the sheriff's office, the sheriff shall take a photograph and a set of fingerprints of the offender and forward the photographs and fingerprints to the department, along with the information provided by the sexual offender. The sheriff shall promptly provide to the department the information received from the sexual offender.

(3) Within 48 hours after the report required under subsection (2), a sexual offender shall report in person at a driver's license office of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, unless a driver's license or identification card that complies with the requirements of s. 322.141(3) was previously secured or updated under s. 944.607.

Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(b) Pay the costs assessed by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for issuing or renewing a driver's license or identification card as required by this section. The driver's license or identification card issued must be in compliance with s. 322.141(3).

The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall forward to the department all photographs and information provided by sexual offenders. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in s. 322.142, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is authorized to release a reproduction of a color-photograph or digital-image license to the Department of Law Enforcement for purposes of public notification of sexual offenders as provided in this section and ss. 943.043 and 944.606.

(b) A sexual offender who vacates a permanent residence and fails to establish or maintain another permanent or temporary residence shall, within 48 hours after vacating the permanent residence, report in person to the sheriff's office of the county in which he or she is located. The sexual offender shall specify the date upon which he or she intends to or did vacate such residence.

The sexual offender must provide an address for the residence or other location that he or she is or will be occupying during the time in which he or she fails to establish or maintain a permanent or temporary residence.

(c) A sexual offender who remains at a permanent residence after reporting his or her intent to vacate such residence shall, within 48 hours after the date upon which the offender indicated he or she would or did vacate such residence, report in person to the agency to which he or she reported pursuant to paragraph (b) for the purpose of reporting his or her address at such residence. When the sheriff receives the report, the sheriff shall promptly convey the information to the department. An offender who makes a report as required under paragraph (b) but fails to make a report as required under this paragraph commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(d) A sexual offender must register any electronic mail address or instant message name with the department prior to using such electronic mail address or instant message name on or after October 1, 2007. The department shall establish an online system through which sexual offenders may securely access and update all electronic mail address and instant message name information.

(5) This section does not apply to a sexual offender who is also a sexual predator, as defined in s. 775.21. A sexual predator must register as required under s. 775.21.

(6) County and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the department, shall verify the addresses of sexual offenders who are not under the care, custody, control, or supervision of the Department of Corrections in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to such verification or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state. Local law enforcement agencies shall report to the department any failure by a sexual offender to comply with registration requirements.

07/26/17
Page 8 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(7) A sexual offender who intends to establish residence in another state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida shall report in person to the sheriff of the county of current residence within 48 hours before the date he or she intends to leave this state to establish residence in another state or jurisdiction. The notification must include the address, municipality, county, and state of intended residence. The sheriff shall promptly provide to the department the information received from the sexual offender. The department shall notify the statewide law enforcement agency, or a comparable agency, in the intended state or jurisdiction of residence of the sexual offender's intended residence. The failure of a sexual offender to provide his or her intended place of residence is punishable as provided in subsection (9).

(8) A sexual offender who indicates his or her intent to reside in another state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida and later decides to remain in this state shall, within 48 hours after the date upon which the sexual offender indicated he or she would leave this state, report in person to the sheriff to which the sexual offender reported the intended change of residence, and report his or her intent to remain in this state. The sheriff shall promptly report this information to the department. A sexual offender who reports his or her intent to reside in another state or jurisdiction but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff in the manner required by this subsection commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(9)(a) A sexual offender who does not comply with the requirements of this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(b) A sexual offender who commits any act or omission in violation of this section may be prosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was committed, the county of the last registered address of the sexual offender, or the county in which the conviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person as a sexual offender.

(c) An arrest on charges of failure to register when the offender has been provided and advised of his or her statutory obligations to register under subsection (2), the service of an information or a complaint for a violation of this section, or an arraignment on charges for a violation of this section constitutes actual notice of the duty to register. A sexual offender's failure to immediately register as required by this section following such arrest, service, or arraignment constitutes grounds for a subsequent charge of failure to register. A sexual offender charged with the crime of failure to register who asserts, or intends to assert, a lack of notice of the duty to register as a defense to a charge of failure to register shall immediately register as required by this section. A sexual offender who is charged with a subsequent failure to register may not assert the defense of a lack of notice of the duty to register.

(d) Registration following such arrest, service, or arraignment is not a defense and does not relieve the sexual offender of criminal liability for the failure to register.

(10) The department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile Justice, any law enforcement agency in this state, and the personnel of those departments; an elected or appointed official, public employee, or school administrator; or an employee, agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any law enforcement agency is immune from civil liability for damages for good faith compliance with the requirements of this section or for the release of information under this section, and shall be presumed to have acted in good faith in compiling, recording, reporting, or releasing the information. The presumption of good faith is not overcome if a technical or clerical error is made by the department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile

07/26/17
Page 9 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

Justice, the personnel of those departments, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any of those departments in compiling or providing information, or if information is incomplete or incorrect because a sexual offender fails to report or falsely reports his or her current place of permanent or temporary residence.

(11) Except as provided in s. 943.04354, a sexual offender must maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life, unless the sexual offender has received a full pardon or has had a conviction set aside in a postconviction proceeding for any offense that meets the criteria for classifying the person as a sexual offender for purposes of registration. However, a sexual offender:

(a)1. Who has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, for at least 25 years and has not been arrested for any felony or misdemeanor offense since release, provided that the sexual offender's requirement to register was not based upon an adult conviction:

a. For a violation of s. 787.01 or s. 787.02;

b. For a violation of s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10);

c. For a violation of s. 800.04(4)(b) where the court finds the offense involved a victim under 12 years of age or sexual activity by the use of force or coercion;

d. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)(b);

e. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)c.2. where the court finds the offense involved unclothed genitals or genital area;

f. For any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such offense; or

g. For a violation of similar law of another jurisdiction,

may petition the criminal division of the circuit court of the circuit in which the sexual offender resides for the purpose of removing the requirement for registration as a sexual offender.

2. The court may grant or deny relief if the offender demonstrates to the court that he or she has not been arrested for any crime since release; the requested relief complies with the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to the removal of registration requirements for a sexual offender or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state; and the court is otherwise satisfied that the offender is not a current or potential threat to public safety. The state attorney in the circuit in which the petition is filed must be given notice of the petition at least 3 weeks before the hearing on the matter. The state attorney may present evidence in opposition to the requested relief or may otherwise demonstrate the reasons why the petition should be denied. If the court denies the petition, the court may set a future date at which the sexual offender may again petition the court for relief, subject to the standards for relief provided in this subsection.

3. The department shall remove an offender from classification as a sexual offender for purposes of registration if the offender provides to the department a certified copy of the court's written findings or order that indicates that the offender is no longer required to comply with the requirements for registration as a sexual offender.

07/26/17
Page 10 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(b) As defined in sub-subparagraph (1)(a)1.b. must maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life until the person provides the department with an order issued by the court that designated the person as a sexual predator, as a sexually violent predator, or by another sexual offender designation in the state or jurisdiction in which the order was issued which states that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to the department that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has been removed by operation of law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was made, and provided such person no longer meets the criteria for registration as a sexual offender under the laws of this state.

(12) The Legislature finds that sexual offenders, especially those who have committed offenses against minors, often pose a high risk of engaging in sexual offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a paramount government interest. Sexual offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. Releasing information concerning sexual offenders to law enforcement agencies and to persons who request such information, and the release of such information to the public by a law enforcement agency or public agency, will further the governmental interests of public safety. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is not a sentence or a punishment but is simply the status of the offender which is the result of a conviction for having committed certain crimes.

(13) Any person who has reason to believe that a sexual offender is not complying, or has not complied, with the requirements of this section and who, with the intent to assist the sexual offender in eluding a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the sexual offender to question the sexual offender about, or to arrest the sexual offender for, his or her noncompliance with the requirements of this section:

(a) Withholds information from, or does not notify, the law enforcement agency about the sexual offender's noncompliance with the requirements of this section, and, if known, the whereabouts of the sexual offender;

(b) Harbors, or attempts to harbor, or assists another person in harboring or attempting to harbor, the sexual offender; or

(c) Conceals or attempts to conceal, or assists another person in concealing or attempting to conceal, the sexual offender; or

(d) Provides information to the law enforcement agency regarding the sexual offender that the person knows to be false information, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(14)(a) A sexual offender must report in person each year during the month of the sexual offender's birthday and during the sixth month following the sexual offender's birth month to the sheriff's office in the county in which he or she resides or is otherwise located to reregister.

(b) However, a sexual offender who is required to register as a result of a conviction for:

1. Section 787.01 or s. 787.02 where the victim is a minor and the offender is not the victim's parent or guardian;

07/26/17
Page 11 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

2. Section 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10);

3. Section 800.04(4)(b) where the court finds the offense involved a victim under 12 years of age or sexual activity by the use of force or coercion;

4. Section 800.04(5)(b);

5. Section 800.04(5)(c)1. where the court finds molestation involving unclothed genitals or genital area;

6. Section 800.04(5)c.2. where the court finds molestation involving unclothed genitals or genital area;

7. Section 800.04(5)(d) where the court finds the use of force or coercion and unclothed genitals or genital area;

8. Any attempt or conspiracy to commit such offense; or

9. A violation of a similar law of another jurisdiction,

must reregister each year during the month of the sexual offender's birthday and every third month thereafter.

948.101 Terms and conditions of community control and criminal quarantine community control.

(1) The court shall determine the terms and conditions of community control. Conditions specified in this subsection do not require oral pronouncement at the time of sentencing and may be considered standard conditions of community control.

(a) The court shall require intensive supervision and surveillance for an offender placed into community control, which may include but is not limited to:

1. Specified contact with the parole and probation officer.
2. Confinement to an agreed-upon residence during hours away from employment and public service activities.
3. Mandatory public service.
4. Supervision by the Department of Corrections by means of an electronic monitoring device or system.
5. The standard conditions of probation set forth in s. 948.03.

(b) For an offender placed on criminal quarantine community control, the court shall require:

1. Electronic monitoring 24 hours per day.
2. Confinement to a designated residence during designated hours.

(2) The enumeration of specific kinds of terms and conditions does not prevent the court from adding thereto any other terms or conditions that the court considers proper. However, the sentencing court may only impose a condition of supervision allowing an offender convicted of s. 794.011, s. 800.04, s. 827.071, or s. 847.0145 to reside in another state if the order stipulates that it is contingent upon the approval of the receiving state interstate compact authority. The court may rescind or modify at any time the terms and conditions theretofore imposed by it upon the offender in community control. However, if the court withholds adjudication of guilt or imposes a period of incarceration as a condition of community control, the period may not exceed 364 days, and incarceration shall be restricted to a county facility, a probation and restitution center under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, a probation program drug punishment phase I secure residential treatment institution, or a community residential facility owned or operated by any entity providing such services.

(3) The court may place a defendant who is being sentenced for criminal transmission of HIV in violation of s. 775.0877 on criminal quarantine community control. The Department of Corrections shall develop and administer a criminal quarantine community control program emphasizing intensive supervision with 24-hour-per-day electronic monitoring. Criminal quarantine community control status must include surveillance and may include other measures normally associated with community control, except that specific conditions necessary to monitor this population may be ordered.

Any change in the sexual offender's permanent or temporary residence, name, any electronic mail address and any instant message name required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (4)(d), after the sexual offender reports in person at the sheriff's office, shall be accomplished in the manner provided in subsections (4), (7), and (8).

(b) Provide his or her name, date of birth, social security number, race, sex, height, weight, hair and eye color, tattoos or other identifying marks, occupation and place of employment, address of permanent or legal residence or address of any current temporary residence, within the state and out of state, including a rural route address and a post office box, any electronic mail address and any instant message name required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (4)(d), date and place of each conviction, and a brief description of the crime or crimes committed by the offender. A post office box shall not be provided in lieu of a physical residential address.

1. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home, as defined in chapter 320, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department through the sheriff's office written notice of the vehicle identification number; the license tag number; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat, as defined in chapter 327, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department written notice of the hull identification number; the manufacturer's serial number; the name of the vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat.

2. If the sexual offender is enrolled, employed, or carrying on a vocation at an institution of higher education in this state, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department through the sheriff's office the name, address, and county of each institution, including each campus attended, and the sexual offender's enrollment or employment status. Each change in enrollment or employment status shall be reported in person at the sheriff's office, within 48 hours after any change in status. The sheriff shall promptly notify each institution of the sexual offender's presence and any change in the sexual offender's enrollment or employment status.

When a sexual offender reports at the sheriff's office, the sheriff shall take a photograph and a set of fingerprints of the offender and forward the photographs and fingerprints to the department, along with the information provided by the sexual offender. The sheriff shall promptly provide to the department the information received from the sexual offender.

(3) Within 48 hours after the report required under subsection (2), a sexual offender shall report in person at a driver's license office of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, unless a driver's license or identification card that complies with the requirements of s. 322.141(3) was previously secured or updated under s. 944.607. At the driver's license office the sexual offender shall:

(a) If otherwise qualified, secure a Florida driver's license, renew a Florida driver's license, or secure an identification card. The sexual offender shall identify himself or herself as a sexual offender who is required to comply with this section and shall provide proof that the sexual offender reported as required in subsection (2). The sexual offender shall provide any of the information specified in subsection (2), if requested. The sexual offender shall submit to the taking of a photograph for use in issuing a driver's license, renewed license, or identification card, and for use by the department in maintaining current records of sexual offenders.

Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(b) Pay the costs assessed by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for issuing or renewing a driver's license or identification card as required by this section. The driver's license or identification card issued must be in compliance with s. 322.141(3).

(c) Provide, upon request, any additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the sexual offender, including a set of fingerprints.

(4)(a) Each time a sexual offender's driver's license or identification card is subject to renewal, and, without regard to the status of the offender's driver's license or identification card, within 48 hours after any change in the offender's permanent or temporary residence or change in the offender's name by reason of marriage or other legal process, the offender shall report in person to a driver's license office, and shall be subject to the requirements specified in subsection (3). The Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles shall forward to the department all photographs and information provided by sexual offenders. Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in s. 322.142, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is authorized to release a reproduction of a color-photograph or digital-image license to the Department of Law Enforcement for purposes of public notification of sexual offenders as provided in this section and ss. 943.043 and 944.606.

(b) A sexual offender who vacates a permanent residence and fails to establish or maintain another permanent or temporary residence shall, within 48 hours after vacating the permanent residence, report in person to the sheriff's office of the county in which he or she is located. The sexual offender shall specify the date upon which he or she intends to or did vacate such residence. The sexual offender must provide or update all of the registration information required under paragraph (2)(b). The sexual offender must provide an address for the residence or other location that he or she is or will be occupying during the time in which he or she fails to establish or maintain a permanent or temporary residence.

(c) A sexual offender who remains at a permanent residence after reporting his or her intent to vacate such residence shall, within 48 hours after the date upon which the offender indicated he or she would or did vacate such residence, report in person to the agency to which he or she reported pursuant to paragraph (b) for the purpose of reporting his or her address at such residence. When the sheriff receives the report, the sheriff shall promptly convey the information to the department. An offender who makes a report as required under paragraph (b) but fails to make a report as required under this paragraph commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(d) A sexual offender must register any electronic mail address or instant message name with the department prior to using such electronic mail address or instant message name on or after October 1, 2007. The department shall establish an online system through which sexual offenders may securely access and update all electronic mail address and instant message name information.

(5) This section does not apply to a sexual offender who is also a sexual predator, as defined in s. 775.21. A sexual predator must register as required under s. 775.21.

(6) County and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the department, shall verify the addresses of sexual offenders who are not under the care, custody, control, or supervision of the Department of Corrections in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to such verification or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state. Local law enforcement agencies shall report to the department any failure by a sexual offender to comply with registration requirements.

07/26/17
Page 25 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(7) A sexual offender who intends to establish residence in another state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida shall report in person to the sheriff of the county of current residence within 48 hours before the date he or she intends to leave this state to establish residence in another state or jurisdiction. The notification must include the address, municipality, county, and state of intended residence. The sheriff shall promptly provide to the department the information received from the sexual offender. The department shall notify the statewide law enforcement agency, or a comparable agency, in the intended state or jurisdiction of residence of the sexual offender's intended residence. The failure of a sexual offender to provide his or her intended place of residence is punishable as provided in subsection (9).

(8) A sexual offender who indicates his or her intent to reside in another state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida and later decides to remain in this state shall, within 48 hours after the date upon which the sexual offender indicated he or she would leave this state, report in person to the sheriff to which the sexual offender reported the intended change of residence, and report his or her intent to remain in this state. The sheriff shall promptly report this information to the department. A sexual offender who reports his or her intent to reside in another state or jurisdiction but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff in the manner required by this subsection commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(9)(a) A sexual offender who does not comply with the requirements of this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(b) A sexual offender who commits any act or omission in violation of this section may be prosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was committed, the county of the last registered address of the sexual offender, or the county in which the conviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person as a sexual offender.

(c) An arrest on charges of failure to register when the offender has been provided and advised of his or her statutory obligations to register under subsection (2), the service of an information or a complaint for a violation of this section, or an arraignment on charges for a violation of this section constitutes actual notice of the duty to register. A sexual offender's failure to immediately register as required by this section following such arrest, service, or arraignment constitutes grounds for a subsequent charge of failure to register. A sexual offender charged with the crime of failure to register who asserts, or intends to assert, a lack of notice of the duty to register as a defense to a charge of failure to register shall immediately register as required by this section. A sexual offender who is charged with a subsequent failure to register may not assert the defense of a lack of notice of the duty to register.

(d) Registration following such arrest, service, or arraignment is not a defense and does not relieve the sexual offender of criminal liability for the failure to register.

(10) The department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile Justice, any law enforcement agency in this state, and the personnel of those departments; an elected or appointed official, public employee, or school administrator; or an employee, agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any law enforcement agency is immune from civil liability for damages for good faith compliance with the requirements of this section or for the release of information under this section, and shall be presumed to have acted in good faith in compiling, recording, reporting, or releasing the information. The presumption of good faith is not overcome if a technical or clerical error is made by the department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile

07/26/17
Page 26 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

Justice, the personnel of those departments, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any of those departments in compiling or providing information, or if information is incomplete or incorrect because a sexual offender fails to report or falsely reports his or her current place of permanent or temporary residence.

(11) Except as provided in s. 943.04354, a sexual offender must maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life, unless the sexual offender has received a full pardon or has had a conviction set aside in a postconviction proceeding for any offense that meets the criteria for classifying the person as a sexual offender for purposes of registration. However, a sexual offender:

(a)1. Who has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, for at least 25 years and has not been arrested for any felony or misdemeanor offense since release, provided that the sexual offender's requirement to register was not based upon an adult conviction:

a. For a violation of s. 787.01 or s. 787.02;
b. For a violation of s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10);
c. For a violation of s. 800.04(4)(b) where the court finds the offense involved a victim under 12 years of age or sexual activity by the use of force or coercion;
d. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)(b);
e. For a violation of s. 800.04(5)c.2. where the court finds the offense involved unclothed genitals or genital area;
f. For any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such offense; or
g. For a violation of similar law of another jurisdiction,

may petition the criminal division of the circuit court of the circuit in which the sexual offender resides for the purpose of removing the requirement for registration as a sexual offender.

2. The court may grant or deny relief if the offender demonstrates to the court that he or she has not been arrested for any crime since release; the requested relief complies with the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to the removal of registration requirements for a sexual offender or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state; and the court is otherwise satisfied that the offender is not a current or potential threat to public safety. The state attorney in the circuit in which the petition is filed must be given notice of the petition at least 3 weeks before the hearing on the matter. The state attorney may present evidence in opposition to the requested relief or may otherwise demonstrate the reasons why the petition should be denied. If the court denies the petition, the court may set a future date at which the sexual offender may again petition the court for relief, subject to the standards for relief provided in this subsection.

3. The department shall remove an offender from classification as a sexual offender for purposes of registration if the offender provides to the department a certified copy of the court's written findings or order that indicates that the offender is no longer required to comply with the requirements for registration as a sexual offender.

07/26/17
Page 27 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

(b) As defined in sub-subparagraph (1)(a)1.b. must maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life until the person provides the department with an order issued by the court that designated the person as a sexual predator, as a sexually violent predator, or by another sexual offender designation in the state or jurisdiction in which the order was issued which states that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to the department that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has been removed by operation of law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was made, and provided such person no longer meets the criteria for registration as a sexual offender under the laws of this state.

(12) The Legislature finds that sexual offenders, especially those who have committed offenses against minors, often pose a high risk of engaging in sexual offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitment and that protection of the public from sexual offenders is a paramount government interest. Sexual offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public's interest in public safety and in the effective operation of government. Releasing information concerning sexual offenders to law enforcement agencies and to persons who request such information, and the release of such information to the public by a law enforcement agency or public agency, will further the governmental interests of public safety. The designation of a person as a sexual offender is not a sentence or a punishment but is simply the status of the offender which is the result of a conviction for having committed certain crimes.

(13) Any person who has reason to believe that a sexual offender is not complying, or has not complied, with the requirements of this section and who, with the intent to assist the sexual offender in eluding a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the sexual offender to question the sexual offender about, or to arrest the sexual offender for, his or her noncompliance with the requirements of this section:

(a) Withholds information from, or does not notify, the law enforcement agency about the sexual offender's noncompliance with the requirements of this section, and, if known, the whereabouts of the sexual offender;

(b) Harbors, or attempts to harbor, or assists another person in harboring or attempting to harbor, the sexual offender; or

(c) Conceals or attempts to conceal, or assists another person in concealing or attempting to conceal, the sexual offender; or

(d) Provides information to the law enforcement agency regarding the sexual offender that the person knows to be false information, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(14)(a) A sexual offender must report in person each year during the month of the sexual offender's birthday and during the sixth month following the sexual offender's birth month to the sheriff's office in the county in which he or she resides or is otherwise located to reregister.

(b) However, a sexual offender who is required to register as a result of a conviction for:

1. Section 787.01 or s. 787.02 where the victim is a minor and the offender is not the victim's parent or guardian;

07/26/17
Page 28 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

2. Section 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10);

3. Section 800.04(4)(b) where the court finds the offense involved a victim under 12 years of age or sexual activity by the use of force or coercion;

4. Section 800.04(5)(b);

5. Section 800.04(5)(c)1. where the court finds molestation involving unclothed genitals or genital area;

6. Section 800.04(5)c.2. where the court finds molestation involving unclothed genitals or genital area;

7. Section 800.04(5)(d) where the court finds the use of force or coercion and unclothed genitals or genital area;

8. Any attempt or conspiracy to commit such offense; or

9. A violation of a similar law of another jurisdiction,

must reregister each year during the month of the sexual offender's birthday and every third month thereafter.

(c) The sheriff's office may determine the appropriate times and days for reporting by the sexual offender, which shall be consistent with the reporting requirements of this subsection. Reregistration shall include any changes to the following information:

1. Name; social security number; age; race; sex; date of birth; height; weight; hair and eye color; address of any permanent residence and address of any current temporary residence, within the state or out of state, including a rural route address and a post office box; any electronic mail address and any instant message name required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (4)(d); date and place of any employment; vehicle make, model, color, and license tag number; fingerprints; and photograph. A post office box shall not be provided in lieu of a physical residential address.

2. If the sexual offender is enrolled, employed, or carrying on a vocation at an institution of higher education in this state, the sexual offender shall also provide to the department the name, address, and county of each institution, including each campus attended, and the sexual offender's enrollment or employment status.

3. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home, as defined in chapter 320, the sexual offender shall also provide the vehicle identification number; the license tag number; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the motor vehicle, trailer, mobile home, or manufactured home. If the sexual offender's place of residence is a vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat, as defined in chapter 327, the sexual offender shall also provide the hull identification number; the manufacturer's serial number; the name of the vessel, live-aboard vessel, or houseboat; the registration number; and a description, including color scheme, of the vessel, live-aboard vessel or houseboat.

4. Any sexual offender who fails to report in person as required at the sheriff's office, or who fails to respond to any address verification correspondence from the department within 3 weeks of the date of the correspondence or who fails to report electronic mail addresses or

07/26/17
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

instant message names, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

(d) The sheriff's office shall, within 2 working days, electronically submit and update all information provided by the sexual offender to the department in a manner prescribed by the department.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 15TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA

Case No.: 502006CF009454AXXXMB

STATE OF FLORIDA

v.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

Defendant

# MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

COMES NOW, Witness Y. Doe,¹ by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves for a protective order pursuant to Florida Rule Criminal Procedure 3.220(l)(1), requiring that the deposition of Y. Doe be taken in this matter in conjunction with and at the same time with the deposition of Y. Doe in the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. As grounds therefore, Witness Y. Doe states as follows:

1. Y. Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2008.

2. Y. Doe is a victim in this matter who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was 16 years old. Y. Doe has brought a civil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case

¹ The witness is named here anonymously as “Y. Doe” because of the sensitive allegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case.

07/26/17

Page 37 of 114

Public Records Request No.: 17-295

no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.

3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and issues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.

4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and necessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by Defendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and traumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.

5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this case if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same time.

6. Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.220(l)(1) provides that the Court may issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, unnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the deposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.220(h)(1) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s circumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be deposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued on good cause shown.”

7. This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal case from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d 1338 (Fla. 1993); State v. Tarrago, 800 So.2d 300 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001). A requirement that a single deposition be taken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary emotional harm to Y. Doe. Finally, the taking of two separate depositions of Y. Doe by

07/26/17
Page 28 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295

Defendant Epstein would be harassment. A protective order under rule 3.220(1)(1) would prevent this harassment.

8. Counsel for Witness Y. Doe has contacted both the attorneys for the State and for Defendant Epstein regarding this request, and neither has responded.

WHEREFORE, Witness Y. Doe respectfully requests a protective order requiring that the deposition in the criminal case and the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, be taken at the same time, and for such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY FLORIDA

STATE OF FLORIDA
CASE NO: 2006 CF 009454 A
Plaintiff,

vs.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN
Defendant.

MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

Jane Doe No. 1 ("Jane Doe"), by and through her mother and natural guardian, hereby files this Motion for Protective Order. As grounds for said motion, Jane Doe states as follows:

1. On July 19, 2006 the State of Florida filed a criminal Indictment against Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein").

2. Jane Doe, a victim of Epstein's actions, recently filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein. The complaint alleges among other things that Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. That he engaged in a scheme in which he gained access to minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. Jane Doe was one of Epstein's victims. She was lured into Epstein's Palm Beach home under false pretenses and was sexually assaulted by Epstein. As a result, Jane Doe suffered injuries, including intentional infliction of emotional distress damages.

3. After the filing of the civil lawsuit and during the week of January 25, 2008, Epstein’s criminal attorney, Jack Goldberger, Esq., contacted the undersigned to advise that he wished to take the deposition, in the criminal matter, of Jane Doe on February 6, 2008. The undersigned informed Mr. Goldberger that he would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, but was not available on February 6, 2008. Counsel agreed to use best efforts to schedule the deposition at a mutually convenient date and time.

4. Despite these assurances and understanding, on Friday evening, February 1, 2008, Epstein’s process server served Jane Doe at her place of work for a deposition scheduled to take place on February 6, 2008.¹ See Subpoena attached as Exhibit “A” (Jane Doe’s real name has been redacted from the exhibit).

5. The undersigned was forced to call Mr. Goldberger on Friday evening and remind him of our earlier conversation and agreement and to insist that the deposition be re-noticed.²

6. After the conversation of Friday evening and with the expressed assurances that the undersigned would accept service for Jane Doe, two days later on Monday morning February 4, 2008, Mr. Goldberger had a process server serve Jane Doe’s mother who resides out of state in Waleska, Georgia. See Subpoena attached as Exhibit “B” (Jane Doe’s mother’s name has been redacted from the exhibit).

7. The service of process on Jane Doe’s mother was defective as an Out of State Commissioner was never appointed and no order was issued by this court authorizing such service. Additionally, Mr. Goldberger had been told not once, but twice that the undersign would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, yet despite this Epstein and/or his attorney has insisted on

¹ Mr. Goldberger unilaterally set Jane Doe’s deposition for February 6, 2008 despite knowing that the undersigned was not available on that date.
² Mr. Goldberger has now agreed to postpone the deposition.

8. Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane Does’ employment and represented himself as an “attorney” who needed to contract her. Upon information and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein’s.

9. It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully attempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous insult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life.

WHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe’s mother and natural guardian, hereby move the Court for a Protective Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from continuous and systematic harassment.

I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was furnished by Facsimile and U. S. Mail, postage prepaid, this 5 day of February 2008 to all counsel on the attached service list.

## COMPLAINT

### Parties, Jurisdiction and Venue

1. Jane Doe is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida. She is a minor under the age of 18 years.

2. Jane Doe’s Father brings this action individually and as parent and natural guardian of Jane Doe. Jane Doe’s Father is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida.

3. Jane Doe’s Stepmother brings this action individually. Jane Doe’s Stepmother is a citizen and resident of the State of Florida.

minor.

5. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York.
6. This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million.
7. This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; and (ii) is between citizens of different states.
8. This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District.

## Factual Allegations

9. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) was an adult male, 52 years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach.

10. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein’s trap and became one of his victims.

11. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas.

12. An integral player in Epstein’s Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach

HERMAN &amp; MERMELSTEIN, P. A.
- 2 -
Page 81 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295
07/26/17

Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan.

13. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator.

14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

Page 82 of 114
Public Records Request No.: 17-295
07/26/17

removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He demanded that Jane remove her clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane.

15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane to him.

16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.

## COUNT I
### Sexual Assault

17. Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 above.

18. Epstein tortiously assaulted Jane Doe sexually in or about 2005.

19. This sexual assault was in violation of Chapter 800 of the Florida Statutes, which recognizes as a crime the lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s assault on Jane, she has suffered and will continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and emotional damages.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, demands judgment against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein for compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

## COUNT II
### Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

21. Plaintiffs Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, Jane Doe’s Father and Jane Doe’s Stepmother, individually, repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 16 above.

22. Epstein’s conduct was intentional or reckless.

23. Epstein’s conduct was outrageous, going beyond all bounds of decency.

24. Epstein’s conduct caused severe emotional distress not only to Jane Doe, but also to her parents, Jane Doe’s Father and Jane Doe’s Stepmother. Epstein knew or had reason to know that his intentional and outrageous conduct would cause emotional trauma and damage to Jane Doe’s parents.

25. As a direct and proximate result of Epstein’s intentional or reckless conduct, Jane Doe, Jane Does’ Father and Jane Doe’s Stepmother have suffered and will continue to suffer severe mental anguish and pain.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, Jane Doe’s Father and Jane Doe’s Stepmother demand judgment against Defendant Jeffrey Epstein for compensatory damages, costs, punitive damages, and such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

## COUNT III
### Loss of Parental Consortium

26. Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Father repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 above.

27. Epstein’s tortious conduct is the direct and proximate cause of damages to Jane Doe’s Father, consisting of parental loss of comfort, companionship and society and healthcare costs

associated with the treatment of Jane.

28. Jane Doe’s Father experienced and will continue to experience great mental anguish, pain and suffering from the time that Defendant’s tortious conduct occurred.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe’s Father demands judgment for loss of consortium damages, costs and such other and further relief as this Court deems proper.

Plaintiffs demand a jury trial in this action.

RE: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein
Case No. 06-9454 CF A99

Dear Ms. Belohlavek:

Pursuant to the mandatory pretrial intervention provision of Florida Statute 796.07 this letter confirms the agreement reached between the parties on July 21, 2006, resolving the above referenced matter.

Mr. Epstein will enter into a pretrial intervention agreement for a period of thirty six (36) months. The deferred prosecution and Mr. Epstein's participation in the Pretrial Intervention Program will terminate at the end of eighteen (18) months as long as Mr. Epstein has successfully completed the conditions of the Pretrial Intervention Program and there have not been any violations during that time.

The conditions of the Pretrial Intervention Program are as follows:

1. Mr. Epstein will refrain from any violation of the law.
2. Mr. Epstein will pay the State of Florida $30.00 per month for the cost of the pretrial intervention agreement.
3. Mr. Epstein will not change his current residences without the permission of his pretrial intervention officer.
4. Mr. Epstein will not possess or carry any firearms.
5. Mr. Epstein will truthfully answer all inquires by his pretrial intervention officer.
6. Mr. Epstein will not use intoxicants to excess.

Telephone: 561.659.8300 • Facsimile: 561.835.8691

7. Mr. Epstein will submit to any urinalysis, breathalyzer, blood tests, or any other testing requested by his pretrial intervention officer.

8. Mr. Epstein, subject to the approval of the pretrial intervention agreement shall be permitted to report to his pretrial intervention officer by mail.

9. As special conditions, Mr. Epstein agrees to be polygraphed by George Slattery &amp; Associates at his own expense at intervals to be determined by the State Attorney's Office upon two weeks notice on any issue that the State Attorney's Office deems appropriate. These polygraph examinations will occur no more frequently than every two months. The results will be provided to the State Attorney's Office and will not be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines that there has been a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the State Attorney's Office gives notice and consults with the defense before taking any action.

10. As an additional special condition, at periodic intervals of six months, twelve months, and ten days prior to the termination of the pretrial intervention agreement, Mr. Epstein shall engage in sessions with Dr. Stephen Alexander at his own expense. Mr. Epstein specifically waives any privilege of confidentiality to the State Attorney's Office concerning the sessions. This waiver of confidentiality is limited to the State Attorney's Office. The results of the sessions with Dr. Alexander will not be disclosed unless the State Attorney's Office determines there has been a violation in the agreement and the State Attorney's Office gives notice and consults with the defense before taking any action.

11. An additional special condition, Mr. Epstein will have no contact with specified individuals to be identified by the State Attorney's Office.

Finally, Mr. Epstein will provide an admission that will be maintained in the State Attorney's Office file admitting that he knowingly, intentionally, and willfully solicited women for prostitution on three occasions as contained in the Indictment in Case No. 06-9454 CF A99. This admission will be provided to the State Attorney's Office to be used only in the unlikely event that there is a violation of the pretrial intervention agreement and the case is referred to the court system for prosecution.

I believe this letter carefully and fully sets out the agreement reached at our meeting on Friday, July 21, 2006. If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Very truly yours,

Jack A. Goldberger
