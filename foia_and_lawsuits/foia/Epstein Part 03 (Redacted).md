# PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Mr. Barry E. Krischer, State Attorney
Office of the State Attorney
Fifteenth Judicial Circuit
401 North Dixie Highway
West Palm Beach, FL 33401

Dear Mr. Krischer,

Please find enclosed the probable cause affidavits and case filing packages thus far resulting from the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. The submission of these documents are both in response to Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek's request for them and to serve as the Palm Beach Police Department's presentation for prosecution.

I know that you agree that it is our shared responsibility to seek justice and to serve the public interest by discharging our duties with fairness and accountability. I must renew my prior observation to you that I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to communicate in this manner but my most recent telephone calls to you and those of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys have been unanswered and messages remain unreturned.

After giving this much thought and consideration, I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Reiter

Chief of Police

|  Defendant: | Sarah Kellen  |
|  Race/Sex: | White Female  |
|  DOB: | 05-25-1975  |
|  Charges: | Principal in the 1st Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor (4) counts
Principal in the 1st Lewd and Lascivious Molestation (1) count  |

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein’s bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. The facts, as reported, are as follows:

On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as “SG,” dob 05/13/1990, and her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG reported that a subject known to her as “Jeff” had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within his residence. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up.

During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG’s boyfriend and classmate at [redacted], worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein’s house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at [redacted] pick her up at her father’s house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach. During the drive a

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck.

SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. She recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.

Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG’s vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG’s voice mail.

Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how he tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.

After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein, each time she was paid $200. Robson stated she had brought the following girls: SG, , , , J.S. (a16 year old female), YL (a 16 year old female) and . Robson said that at the time she brought these girls to Epstein’s house they were all14 through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and arrangements were made to bring her to Epstein’s house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and (Later identified as ) picked up SG at her house. Robson stated that at that time she was driving a red pickup truck. They traveled to Epstein’s house and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein’s assistant Sarah. SG was introduced to Epstein while they were in the kitchen area. Sarah led SG upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over SG returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing SG to Epstein’s house. Robson stated SG told her she was paid $300.00 for the massage.

Robson stated that SG was the last person she brought to Epstein’s house. She had changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to “work” for Epstein. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson’s house and leaves messages.

Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein’s house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived.

As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fleiss.” (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was brought to Epstein’s residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS’s mother at their front door. We explained the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had “worked” for Jeff. Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff’s house with Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein’s house. I informed her that JS had my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

On October 4, 2005, Det Dawson and I drove to the home and met with , dob 06/30/1987. During a sworn taped statement, stated approximately a year ago when she was seventeen years old, she was taken to a house by Haley Robson. stated she knows Robson because they both attend Royal Palm Beach High School. She was told she could make money working

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove ML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any additional work.

On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein's house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid $200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.

On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.

During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, Beale and during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.

Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and who were minors at the time this occurred, and who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a fourteen year old minor. Therefore, as Sarah Kellen coordinated and aided in the recruitment of minors to frequent Epstein’s house so that sexual services were provided to Epstein, scheduled the said minors to return to the work for Epstein, secured their appointments for the purpose of sexual activity and lewd and lascivious acts and arranged the bedroom for said minors, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with four counts of Principal in the 1st degree Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), a second degree felony and there is sufficient probable cause to charge her with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein’s bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. The facts, as reported, are as follows:

On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as “SG,” dob 05/13/1990, and her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG reported that a subject known to her as “Jeff” had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within his residence. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up.

During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG’s boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein’s house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at __________, a, pick her up at her father’s house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday.

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck.

SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. She recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG.

massage SG’s vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG’s voice mail.

Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove ML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any additional work.

On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein's residence. CL stated she met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age.

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid $200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.

On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.

During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, [redacted], [redacted] Beale and [redacted] during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.

Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and [redacted], who were minors at the time this occurred, and who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a fourteen year old minor. Therefore, as Sarah Kellen coordinated and aided in the recruitment of minors to frequent Epstein’s house so that sexual services were provided to Epstein, scheduled the said minors to return to the work for Epstein, secured their appointments for the purpose of sexual activity and lewd and lascivious acts and arranged the bedroom for said minors, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with four counts of Principal in the 1st degree Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), a second degree felony and there is sufficient probable cause to charge her with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

|  Defendant: | Haley Robson  |
|  Race/Sex: | White Female  |
|  DOB: | 04-09-1986  |
|  Charges: | Lewd and Lascivious Act on a child under 16 years of age 800.04(6)(2b)  |

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein’s bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. The facts, as reported, are as follows:

On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as “SG,” dob 05/13/1990, and her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG reported that a subject known to her as “Jeff” had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within his residence. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up.

During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG’s boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein’s house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at __________, pick her up at her father’s house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach. During the drive a conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age,

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck.

SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. She recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.

Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG’s vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG’s voice mail.

Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how he tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.

After the massage Epstein stated to Robson that he understood she was not comfortable, but he would pay her if she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson stated that in total she only remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein, each time she was paid $200. Robson stated she had brought the following girls: SG, [redacted], J.S. (a 16 year old female), YL (a 16 year old female) and [redacted]. Robson said that at the time she brought these girls to Epstein’s house they were all 14 through 16 years of age. I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised SG was the youngest as she was fourteen when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if SG was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew that SG wanted to make money. She approached SG and explained about going to work for Jeff, SG agreed and arrangements were made to bring her to Epstein’s house on a weekend. Robson stated that she and [redacted] (Later identified as [redacted]) picked up SG at her house. Robson stated that at that time she was driving a red pickup truck.

Sarah led SG upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over SG returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing SG to Epstein’s house. Robson stated SG told her she was paid $300.00 for the massage.

Robson stated that SG was the last person she brought to Epstein’s house. She had changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to “work” for Epstein. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson’s house and leaves messages.

Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein’s house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived.

As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fleiss.” (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was brought to Epstein’s residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS’s mother at their front door. We explained the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had “worked” for Jeff. Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff’s house with Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein’s house. I informed her that JS had my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

On October 4, 2005, Det Dawson and I drove to the home and met with , dob 06/30/1987. During a sworn taped statement, , stated approximately a year ago when she was seventeen years old, she was taken to a house by Haley Robson. stated she knows Robson because they both attend Royal Palm Beach High School.

for Jeff. She was told she would have to provide a massage to Jeff. [REDACTED] stated upon her arrival to the house she was brought to the kitchen area by Robson. They met with the house chef who was already in the kitchen area. [REDACTED] stated Haley Robson would wait for her in the kitchen. [REDACTED] was introduced to Sarah, Jeff’s assistant, who brought her upstairs to the master bedroom. Sarah prepared the room and massage table for a massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and she provided a massage. [REDACTED] stated she kept her clothes on during the massage. She advised sometime during the massage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks and pulled her close to him. [REDACTED] said she was uncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclusion of the massage, she was paid $200.00 for the massage. I asked [REDACTED] if she has any formal training in massages to which she replied no. I asked her if Robson received any monies for taking her to perform the massage. [REDACTED] stated Robson had received money for taking her there but was unsure in the amount. [REDACTED] stated she returned to Epstein’s house on another occasion with Robson and another girl, [REDACTED] [REDACTED] stated she waited in the kitchen with Robson, while [REDACTED] was taken upstairs by Sarah. [REDACTED] stated she only did the massage once as she was uncomfortable with the whole experience.

A voice mail message on October 4, 2005 at 10:59 am, revealed a female voice who identified herself as Sarah who requested [REDACTED] to call her back reference the police questioning. [REDACTED] provided the incoming telephone number as 917-855-3363.

introduced to Sarah and Epstein. She was taken upstairs to a bedroom by Sarah who set the room up with a massage bed and brought out the oils to use. Epstein then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the table and picked out a lotion for JS to rub on him. At one point during the massage he tried to remove her shirt, at which point she became very upset and discontinued the massage. Both JS and Epstein had a verbal disagreement, at which time she left without being paid. She got with Haley Robson who was sitting in the kitchen and told her “let’s go.” JS advised she received no money for that day. JS also said that Haley Robson had told her if she was uncomfortable with what was going on, to let him know and he’ll stop. She knew that the more you do the more you get paid. JS advised that several weeks later she agreed to be taken a second time by Haley Robson. Once they arrived at the residence, Haley Robson sat in the kitchen and Sarah took her upstairs to the master bedroom again. Sarah set the room up with a massage bed and brought out the oils to use. Epstein then entered the room wearing a towel. He laid on the table and picked out a lotion for JS to rub on him. At one point during the massage he tried to touch her buttocks. As JS was wearing tight jeans and had a tight belt on Epstein was unable to touch her buttocks. Epstein then rolled onto his back during the massage and then attempted to touch her breasts. JS then became upset again and told Epstein she didn’t want to be touched. JS discontinued the massage and was paid $200.00. JS then went downstairs where Haley Robson was waiting for her. She told Robson she wanted to leave. JS said she never returned to the house. JS stated she is aware that her friend, [redacted], was also at the house and had a problem with Epstein.

I later researched [redacted], dob 02/08/1987, and met with her at her residence.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove ML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein’s back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML stated she was shy and didn’t like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said “no, I don’t like that.” Epstein then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, “Relax, I’m not going inside.” She further explained Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, “He commented how hard my clit was.” He then inserted two fingers in her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any additional work.

On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988. CL was identified as a potential victim/witness from information obtained during trash pulls from Epstein’s residence. CL stated she met Epstein when she was fifteen years of age. She was approached by a friend from Royal Palm Beach High School, Tatum Miller, to be taken to Jeffrey Epstein’s house to work. She was originally told she would be able

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid $200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.

On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house.

Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.

During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, Beale and during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.

As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did commit lewd and lascivious molestation on SG, a fourteen year old minor, by using a vibrator on her external vaginal area and as Haley Robson recruited, set up the appointment and drove to Epstein’s residence, knowing that SG was fourteen years old and knowing there would be unlawful sexual activity between SG and Epstein that Robson received monetary compensation for taking said fourteen year old female by Epstein, there is sufficient probable cause to arrest Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Act on victim under 16 years of age in violation of Florida State Statue 800.04 (6)(2b) a second degree felony.

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein’s bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. The facts, as reported, are as follows:

On 03/15/2005, A fourteen year old white female, hereinafter referred to as “SG,” dob 05/13/1990, and her family reported unlawful sexual activity which occurred at a residence within the Town of Palm Beach. SG reported that a subject known to her as “Jeff” had touched her vaginal area with a vibrator/massager while within his residence. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein through a photo line up.

During a sworn taped interview, SG stated that Haley Robson, dob 04/09/1986, a cousin of SG’s boyfriend and classmate at Royal Palm Beach High School, worked for a wealthy man and did sexual favors for him. She also admitted that Robson had offered her an opportunity to make money. During the beginning of the month of February 2005, SG explained that she was first approached by Robson to go with her to Epstein’s house. SG stated that Robson along with a Hispanic female, later identified at __________, pick her up at her father’s house on a Sunday. SG was not sure of the exact dates but knew it was a Sunday. SG told her father that they were going shopping but in reality Robson drove them to Palm Beach.

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck.

SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. She recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.

Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area. Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an up and down motion. Epstein then pulled out a purple vibrator and began to

massage SG’s vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG’s voice mail.

Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked Robson up and she was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s bedroom. Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah, then left the room and informed Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how he tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.

Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to “work” for Epstein. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped.

As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fleiss.” (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

I left my telephone number and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein’s house. I informed her that JS had my telephone number and hopefully she would call.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988. During a sworn taped statement, ML stated that when she was sixteen years old she was taken to Epstein’s house to provide a massage for money. ML stated it was before Christmas last year (2004) when an associate, YL, approached her and asked if she needed to make money for Christmas. YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove ML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the phone when she entered the room. Epstein was wearing a white towel and laid on his stomach so that ML may

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein's back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML stated she was shy and didn't like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said "no, I don't like that." Epstein then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, "Relax, I'm not going inside." She further explained Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, "He commented how hard my clit was." He then inserted two fingers in her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any additional work.

On January 9, 2006, I located and interviewed another victim, CL, dob 04/29/1988.

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid $200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

their vaginal area. He would masturbate during the massage and upon his climaxing, the massage would end. The girls were then paid two or three hundred dollars for the massage.

On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose Alessi, a former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein's home. Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn-taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house.

Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.

During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, [redacted] and [redacted] during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.

As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did commit lewd and lascivious molestation on SG, a fourteen year old minor, by using a vibrator on her external vaginal area and as Haley Robson recruited, set up the appointment and drove to Epstein’s residence, knowing that SG was fourteen years old and knowing there would be unlawful sexual activity between SG and Epstein that Robson received monetary compensation for taking said fourteen year old female by Epstein, there is sufficient probable cause to arrest Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Act on victim under 16 years of age in violation of Florida State Statue 800.04 (6)(2b) a second degree felony.

during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both AH and Marcinkova. This occurred during the time AH was sixteen years of age.

AH advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to AH. Epstein’s assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped.

During the course of the investigation a search warrant was executed at Jeffrey Epstein’s home located at 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the house. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been interviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the bottom of the messages. During the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s bedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed that contained a bottle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm massage. Several massage tables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a massage table found in Epstein’s bedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located which was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed which showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.

On December 13, 2005, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob 02/29/1988.

ML was unable to remember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led upstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the lotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and bathroom. The massage table was already set up in the bathroom. ML described the bathroom as a large spacious bathroom with a steam room and shower beside it. ML was introduced to Epstein who was on the phone when she entered the room.

massage his feet and calves. ML started the massage with the oils Epstein chose and rubbed his feet and calves. Epstein got off the phone and requested she massage his back as well. ML began rubbing his back and got to the small of his back. During the rubbing of his back, Epstein asked her to get comfortable. He requested she remove her pants and shirt. ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong panties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein’s back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein instructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions about herself. ML remembered telling him she attended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if she was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML stated she was shy and didn’t like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached up and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein rubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said “no, I don’t like that.” Epstein then removed his towel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and masturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her vagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she was uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, “Relax, I’m not going inside.” She further explained Epstein commented to her how beautiful and sexy she was. Epstein then moved her thong panties to one side and began stroking her clitoris. ML said, “He commented how hard my clit was.” He then inserted two fingers in her vagina and was stroking her within her vagina. She tried pulling back to pull out his fingers from within her vagina. Epstein removed his fingers from within her vagina and apologized for putting his fingers inside her. During this time, he kept his hand on her vaginal area and continued to rub her vagina. ML stated he rubbed her really hard as he was masturbating. ML said he climaxed onto the towel he had been previously wearing and got up from the table. Epstein told her there was $200.00 dollars for her on the dresser within the master bathroom. Epstein also told her that there was an additional $100.00 that was to be given to YL for bringing her there to massage him. Epstein told her to leave her telephone number with his assistant as he wanted to see her again. Epstein stated his assistant would contact her to work again soon. I asked her if she ever received any formal massage training to which ML stated she did not. ML stated it was the only time she ever went to work for Jeff and knew what happened to her was wrong. She further stated that she had never been contacted for any additional work.

to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00 for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid $200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on

When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage.

Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.

Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm Beach High School for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's

bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house.

Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and direction to extend the rental contract.

During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated the encounters with AH, AD, Beale and during the time frame the girls stated they occurred.

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.

Therefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and , who were minors at the time this occurred, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Jeffrey Epstein with four counts of Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), a second degree felony. As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a fourteen year old minor, there is sufficient probable cause to charge him with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.

From March 15, 2005, through February 2006, the Palm Beach Police Department conducted a sexual battery investigation involving Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Haley Robson. Sworn taped statements were taken from five victims and seventeen witnesses concerning massages and unlawful sexual activity that took place at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach. Several of the victims were recruited by and brought to the residence by Haley Robson to perform massages for Epstein, for which Robson received monetary compensation. During the visit they would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who in turn would record their telephone numbers and name. The victims would be brought to Epstein’s bedroom to provide the massage. Epstein would enter the room and order the victims to remove their clothing to provide the massage. As the victims complied and provided the massages, Epstein would rub his fingers on their vaginas. On occasion, Epstein would introduce a massager/vibrator and rub the victims vaginas as they provided the massage. On three separate occasions, Epstein had intercourse and inserted his penis/fingers in the victims vaginas. At the conclusion of the massages the victims were paid sums of money ranging from $200 - $1,000. The facts, as reported, are as follows:

conversation occurred between Robson and SG whereas Robson reportedly told SG that if Jeff asked her age, she should say she was eighteen. It was later confirmed by the SG's father that Robson picked his daughter up on February 6, 2005. According to SG's father, Robson drove a pick up truck.

SG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the driveway. She recalled that Jeff's house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that they walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them asking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male allowed them to continue walking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He allowed them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside. Shortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as Sarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being approximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrows, with graying hair.

Robson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later. They all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follow Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a flight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a massage table in it. Upon entering the room there was a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of the sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of naked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.

Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein was stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not know what to do as she was the only one there in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his towel and told the SG to take off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his towel off, placing it on the floor as he laid down on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed her to give him a massage pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the massage, he told her to get on his back. SG stated she straddled herself on Epstein's back whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein's bare buttocks. SG said Epstein was specific in his instruction to her on how to massage him, telling her to go clockwise or counter clockwise. Epstein then turned over and instructed SG to massage his chest. SG was now standing on the ground and resumed massaging Epstein's chest area. SG stated Epstein held onto the small of her back as she massaged his chest and shoulder area.

massage SG’s vaginal area. SG stated there was no penetration as the vibrator was on top of her underwear. SG recalled Epstein ejaculating because he had to use the towel to wipe himself as he got off the table. Epstein then left the room and SG got dressed. She went back downstairs where she met with Robson. SG said she was paid three hundred dollars in cash from Epstein. Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone number. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred dollars that day for bringing her.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the investigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. SG spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Robson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an appointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at 11:00 am on April 5, 2005. This message was recorded from SG’s voice mail.

Based on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2005 revealed a telephone message for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the driveway, a red Dodge Neon. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the interview she would be returned home. Robson voluntarily came with us back to the Palm Beach Police Department.

Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau where I obtained a taped, sworn statement. I began the interview by asking Robson how she became acquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, she was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

when he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to “work” for Epstein. Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson’s house and leaves messages.

Sgt Frick entered the room and explained to Robson that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by bringing underage girls to Epstein’s house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived.

As Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fleiss.” (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JS, a sixteen year-old female who was brought to Epstein’s residence by Haley Robson. We met with JS’s mother at their front door. We explained the ongoing investigation and asked to speak with JS as we had information that she had “worked” for Jeff. Mrs. S introduced us to her husband and allowed us entry into the home. We sat in the dining room and met with JS, Date of Birth 07-28-1988. As she was under the age of eighteen, Mrs S was advised we would be speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We interviewed JS, who denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to Jeff’s house with Haley Robson approximately eight months ago and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but nothing happened. As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that JS was withholding information from us. She made several comments as to putting the entire incident behind her. I left my telephone number and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her time and left the area. She stated she would ask JS again after we left as to what happened at Epstein’s house. I informed her that JS had my telephone number and hopefully she would call.
