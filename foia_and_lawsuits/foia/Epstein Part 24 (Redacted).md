|  Total | 49,123,244 | (14,949,562) | (34,173,682) |  |   |

(1) See page 2 of the Calculation of Estimated Performance Fee for detail of the Managed Cash Flows for years 2002-2004. Please note New Albany Country Club is not included until 1/1/2005. All Cash Flows are used to pay NACO Interest and any excess is applied as a NACO Capital Account reduction.
(2) The Annual Interest rate is 6.5%. Interest is calculated on the previous Year's Ending Capital Account Balance. Interest Payments and Capital Account Additions /(Reductions) are applied at the end of Calendar Year.
(3) Positive Cash flow from Managed Properties is applied in the following order: (i) Interest Expense for NACO if any, and the balance applied to reduce the NACO Capital Account until balance is Zero. If the Cash Flow is insufficient to pay the current interest expense then the unpaid portion of the interest will be added to the Capital Account Balance. Interest on Georgetown's Capital accrues and is added to the Capital Account. Interest for 2004 is based on 124 days and a 366 day year.
(4) Capital Account Balance as of January 1, 2002 is $85,000,000. NACO is allocated $75,000,000 or 88.24% and Georgetown is allocated $10,000,000 or 11.76%. Thereafter, the Capital Account Balance is the sum of the Capital as of January 1, 2002 plus Additions and less any Reductions. The Capital Account Balance is as of the end of each Calendar Year.

NOTES/COMMENTS:

Jeffrey,

Attached is a schedule comparing the value of the Managed Properties as of 1/1/2002 and the estimated value as of 12/31/2004, including the calculation of the Performance Fee.

Regarding your request for the value of the Excluded Properties as of 1/1/2002, the E&amp;Y appraisal done in 2001 only included "Managed Properties". Approximately 1,000 acres were not included in the E &amp; Y appraisal because they were identified before the appraisal as Excluded Properties. In addition, a significant portion of the acres (approximately 1000) included in the appraisal were transferred to Excluded Properties before the Beginning Value was finalized. If you would like me to prepare an estimate the value of the Excluded Properties as of 1/1/2002 please let me know.

Regards,

Ed,

We're working with Merrill Lynch investment bank and Delta to raise $50 million by selling at a discount the first $600 million worth of jet fuel from our production schedule. The $600 million will have an opportunity to be re-invested for equity in the fuel facility to create an opportunity for additional earnings at the investor's option. Assuming we get a 3:1 multiplier in this second round, the $50 million could conceivably net the investors $1.8 billion in less than 3 years. We're looking at 10 shares of $5 million each - its all spelled out in the enclosed literature.

Let me know if there is any interest by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone you know. Let me know what you need from me to help make this happen. Where possible -and necessary- we have agreed to pay finders fees that are convertible to share interest.

Once we have the $50 million we'll move the program past feasibility to the point where project financing is possible. The Delta contract is worth nearly $18 billion. The value of the jet fuel produced by the installation once complete will be around $60 billion - assuming a 20 year life.

Thanks.

MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just object.

let me instruct you. Anything that you have learned through conversations between you and me are protected. So if you know any of that information outside of those discussions, you may answer. But if the only way you know it is through our discussions, do not answer that question.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q.  you know that Mr. Leopold recently filed a lawsuit in federal court on your behalf against Jeffrey Epstein seeking fifty million dollars?

MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection.

If you know the answer to that outside of our discussions, you may answer. If it is the only way that you know the answer is through our discussions, do not answer that question.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. LEOPOLD: Attorney/client privilege.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. You can answer the question unless --

MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection.

MR. TEIN: Let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. We're --

MR. TEIN: No. Let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Lewis, we're not going to do that.

MR. TEIN: My name is not Lewis. I'm going to finish my question. Okay?

MR. LEOPOLD: Do not answer until you hear from me.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Other than conversations that you have had with Mr. Leopold -- I'm not asking about that -- are you aware that Mr. Leopold has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking fifty million dollars from Jeffrey Epstein on your behalf?

MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. Anything that you learn through conversations between you and me, do not answer. Those are protected. If you know through any other realm of knowledge, you may answer.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. You have no idea that Mr. Leopold filed a fifty million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against Jeffrey Epstein?

MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. Do not answer that question if it's through discussions that you and I had. Outside of that,

you may answer. So do not answer that question if that is the only basis by which you understand that answer.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. You didn't know that?

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer that question. Again, it's attorney/client privilege. Any information you've learned through conversations between you and I are protected. If you know it through any other realm, you may answer.

MR. TEIN: Are you going to say that for every question in the deposition, Mr. Leopold?

MR. LEOPOLD: When you ask improper questions like that without the proper --

MR. TEIN: You're going to stop your speaking objections right now. Okay?

MR. LEOPOLD: Without the proper --

MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking objections.

Let's continue.

MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, you just asked me a question and I'm going to state it on the record --

MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking

objections. Check your rules.

MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. For the record, Counsel asked me a question. I'll state the answer on the record. He asked me the question am I going to be answering that way throughout the deposition. So long as there's improper foundation and predicate asked by the attorney, I will protect my client and I make the record where appropriate. If counsel wishes to ask an appropriate worded question with the proper foundation and predicate, I will certainly allow the client to answer the question.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you just state attorney/client privilege and just be done with it?

MR. LEOPOLD: I want the record to be clear.

MR. TEIN: You want to waste time is what you want to do.

You were supposed to be here this morning and you totally broke the deal, the agreement that you had with us if your hearing got cancelled.

But let's move on and maybe you'll stop obstructing this deposition.

MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very

clear where we stand thus far.

Is there a recording taken of this deposition?

THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.

MR. LEOPOLD: Just make sure that's preserved.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Go to Exhibit 20-01 -- well, before you do that [redacted] are you aware that a lawyer named Jeffrey Herman filed a lawsuit on your behalf, yes or no?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection.

Any conversations that you and I have had regarding that, if that is the only way by which you understand how to answer that question, do not answer. It's attorney/client privilege, as well as any conversations you may have had with the attorney from Miami. That is also attorney/client privilege. And I'm assuming --

MR. TEIN: You're actually wrong about the attorney/client privilege.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm assuming Counsel is not asking you to divulge attorney/client --

MR. TEIN: Of course not.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. [redacted] are you aware that Jeffrey Herman,

an attorney, filed a fifty-million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against Jeffrey Epstein, yes or no?

MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection.

MR. TEIN: We've heard the objection 10 times already.

MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, excuse me.

MR. TEIN: Just say attorney/client privilege. Stop interrupting my questions.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm entitled to make an objection for the record, which I'm doing, and I'll make the same objection. And if it calls for attorney/client privilege, any conversations you and I have had, do not answer the question.

And I think that it might be appropriate, for the record, to ask questions via "Ms. [redacted]" as opposed to [redacted]. I think that would be more appropriate for this deposition.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Go ahead. Please answer yes or no.

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you.

In fact, you know that Mr. Herman held a press conference after he filed the fifty-million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf, don't you?

A. After it happened.

Q. You know that he had a press conference, don't you, yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. In fact, let's go to Exhibit 20-01.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Look behind you. You'll see it.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Have you ever seen that picture before?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that a picture of your father, your stepmother and Mr. Herman at the press conference regarding your lawsuit?

A. Yes.

Q. Now you know that this is a very serious matter, don't you?

MR. LEOPOLD: Asked and answered.

Objection.

MR. GOLDBERGER: All right. You can object. You're representing a witness here, Mr. Leopold. You can object on privilege grounds. You cannot make legal objections. You have no standing to do so.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make them and then --

MR. LEOPOLD: We're going to leave or we're going to take a break, because his demeanor is not appropriate. There's no reason to have this kind of demeanor. If you want to have this kind of demeanor with me --

MR. TEIN: You are obstructing this deposition.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you guys go outside and just talk about --

MR. LEOPOLD: She -- her job is very difficult and she's not going to be able to take us both talking at the same time.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Off the record.

MR. LEOPOLD: We're not going off the record, Jack. We're not, Jack. Her job is very difficult. I'm going to make the record.

I don't think it is appropriate, especially in the small confines of this room, to be very aggressive with this young lady.

MR. TEIN: That's not happening. Stop, stop actually --

MR. LEOPOLD: If you're going to interrupt me, we're going to cancel this deposition --

MR. TEIN: Stop misrepresenting.

THE COURT REPORTER: I need one at a time,

no matter who it is.

MR. LEOPOLD: I think we're going to take a break. Perhaps you might want to talk to your co-counsel --

MR. TEIN: I don't need to talk to him.

MR. LEOPOLD: But we're going to take a break.

MR. TEIN: We're not taking a break unless the witness needs a break.

You're obstructing this deposition, Ted.

MR. LEOPOLD: Come on, [illegible].

You all want to continue in this demeanor --

MR. TEIN: You're obstructing the deposition. Stop making speeches. We're not discussing this with you. The questions are to your client. Go take your five-minute break.

MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. We need to make sure the record's clear and clean.

And I want to make sure, as I've already asked you -- I know that you're one of the best in town -- that this audio -- this needs to be preserved. Okay?

MR. TEIN: Go take your five-minute break, Mr. Leopold, now.

You were supposed to be here at nine a.m.; it's now after two. Take your break and come back.

MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. If the demeanor keeps up, we will not be here beyond those five minutes.

MR. TEIN: Take your break and come back.

MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. So I suggest that you relax.

MR. TEIN: I suggest that you take your break.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Let them take that five-minute break.

MR. LEOPOLD: But I would suggest that you take deep breaths.

MR. TEIN: Suggest whatever you want. Go take a break.

(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)

Q. What word did you use in there?

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not asking questions. I'm asking for the record the word to be spelled, because we don't have a video here today.

MR. TEIN: These exhibits are part of the record. You --

MR. LEOPOLD: Well, it's not marked as an exhibit.

Q. You wrote that to your friend, didn't you?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Asked and answered, for the fourth time.

MR. TEIN: You are improperly objecting, Mr. Leopold. You have no grounds to object. And that's not an objection.

MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection.

MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if you think it's been asked and answered.

MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded from just making an objection to the form of the question. As the courts well know, and if you practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the judges require you to set the objection with specificity. And I will do that. And if you don't want me to, you can make the record. But I will do that.

MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to form for every single one of my questions. Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing.

MR. LEOPOLD: I won't do that.

MR. TEIN: Of course; because you want to obstruct.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make the record. You cannot interrupt me when I'm making the record. Out of professional conduct, you cannot do that. I'm entitled to make the record. I made an objection, asked and answered. Your demeanor is inappropriate. You're willing and you are able and you're responsible to ask a question in a professional manner, and ask the question and once you get the answer, to either follow up on it or move on, but not continuously browbeat and ask the same question over and over because you don't like the answer.

MR. TEIN: Calm down, sir.

MR. LEOPOLD: Trust me, I'm very calm here. When I'm not calm, you'll know it. I'm very calm. So please continue on. But I will not allow you to continue to harass her in the demeanor that you're doing. Ask her a question and move on.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q.
MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very clear.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me just clarify something. When you object to the form of a question, you're not instructing the witness not to answer the question, are you?

MR. LEOPOLD: No. And I'm not making that objection; only on attorney/client privilege.

MR. TEIN: Will you stop speaking now so I can ask my question? Are you done? Okay. I'm going to ask my question.

Q. Listen,

And I think it's highly inappropriate to do this with this child sitting here, the way you're acting, primarily towards me, and I will not put up with it.

MR. TEIN: Will you please stop your speech so I can ask questions?

MR. LEOPOLD: So long as you act professionally, I will do so. But if you continue to do it this way, I will leave.

Q. You can answer the question.

A. Sure.

Q. Is there anything that would refresh your memory that in fact you told Mr. Epstein's assistant, the one who walked you upstairs, that you went to college and you had just moved down here from Ohio?

A. I don't remember saying that, but if you -- I don't remember saying that myself, so --

Q. That would be a lie, right?

A. No. I really don't remember.

Q. So you told Jeff that you were 18 years old, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember Detective Michelle Pagan of the Police Department, Palm Beach Police Department?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember you spoke to her?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember that you told Detective Pagan that when you lied about your age to Jeff you said it really fast because you didn't want to make it sound like you were lying?

A. I don't remember the words exactly, but I do remember telling her I told him I was 18.

that when you lied to Epstein about your age that you said it really fast so Epstein wouldn't realize you were lying?

A. No, I don't remember saying those words exactly to her. I remember telling her that I told Epstein I was 18.

Q. Does it sound right to you that you told Detective Pagan that you said your age really fast to Epstein --

MS. BELOHLAVEK: Objection. Asked and answered.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. -- so he wouldn't think that you were lying?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Asked and answered, lack of foundation, mischaracterization of her earlier testimony. She's already answered that question.

Does it sound right to you that you told Detective Pagan that when you lied about your age to Jeffrey Epstein, you said it really fast because you didn't want to make it sound like you were lying?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Lack of foundation, asked and answered.

THE WITNESS: I could have possibly said that, yes.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were lying about your age, right?
A. Correct.
Q. You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were not 18, right?

Q. So you lied to Mr. Epstein again, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is Wellington the college that you told Jeff's assistant that you were attending?

A. I don't remember having that conversation with her, so I wouldn't know if that's what I said.

Q. That was a lie, though, wasn't it?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection to the form of the question, lack of foundation. You're making an assumption. She just answered you she can't tell you that.

MR. TEIN: Speaking objection. And you well know that, Mr. Leopold.

MR. LEOPOLD: She can't answer that question. The way you phrased that question, you're purposely making her not be honest in her testimony. She can't answer a question like that. She doesn't remember. So then you say, "So you were lying." That's improper and you know that. That's not a proper question. And any attorney

CERTIFIED QUESTION...

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. You asked your co-workers --

MR. LEOPOLD: It's vague and ambiguous.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. You asked your co-workers at the Quarterdeck Tavern to lie for you, didn't you?
A. No. I informed my boss about what was going on and he told me that he would help in any way that he can.
Q. Okay. You got your friend Tiffany to lie by switching name tags with you, correct?
A. Incorrect. It was a coincidence that same night she was not wearing her name tag; she was wearing mine. But I was also not wearing -- I was wearing my name tag. Everyone switches name tags. It just so happens it was a coincidence that same night the people came with the papers.

MR. TEIN: Will you put up Exhibit 18-001?

MR. GOLDBERGER: And mark 18-001 for identification purposes to this deposition.

MR. LEOPOLD: None of them have been marked yet. Can we mark them and put them as attachment to the depositions? Because I think you've shown three photos now. And this is the only one that

has been marked for identification yet.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q.
MR. LEOPOLD: Hold on just a second. Just so the record is clear --
MR. TEIN: I'm not speaking to you.
MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Then don't speak to me then. But I'll speak to Mr. Goldberger, perhaps. But at least for the record, can we put on the record what the previous two photographs were marked for identification?
MR. GOLDBERGER: We will make sure that the record is clear at the end of the deposition so that there's no ambiguity.
MR. LEOPOLD: Thank you.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. I've put a photograph marked 18-001 up on the screen. Do you see that?
A. Yup.
Q. Who is that in the photo?
A. Tiffany on the left and me on the right.
Q. Tiffany Rich, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Tiffany Rich, your friend at the Quarterdeck Tavern, right?

1. A. Yes.
2. Q. Tiffany, your friend, who you say the day that the process servers went to serve you with a subpoena for this deposition, just happened -- just by coincidence, was wearing your name tag?
3. A. Yes, sir.
4. Q. And just by coincidence, you were wearing her name tag, correct?
5. A. Yes.
6. Q. Your testimony under oath is that's just a coincidence, right?
7. A. Total honesty.
8. Q. It just happens to be the day that you were going to be served with a subpoena, correct?
9. A. That wasn't the first day that --
10. MR. LEOPOLD: just answer the question. It calls for a yes or no.
11. THE WITNESS: Yes.
12. BY MR. TEIN:
13. Q. You said that wasn't the first day you were going to be -- you thought you were being served with a subpoena, correct?
14. A. Correct.

looking for you, didn't you?

A. No. I knew --

MR. LEOPOLD: Just answer it. It calls for a yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Okay. No.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Now you can explain the answer that your counsel stopped you from explaining.

A. Okay. I work at Quarterdeck and people were telling me that people were looking for me. So yes, I was aware that people were searching for me. But I had no idea who they were or what their intentions were. But I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. So I just didn't want to talk to them. And every time they'd come to work I wasn't there. And so happens the night that they came in me and my friend switched name tags. No big deal.

Q. That's a lie, isn't it?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Don't answer that question. That's harassment and I will not allow it. He could ask the questions and we'll allow a jury to make that determination, but not counsel. I will not allow her to answer that question.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'll certify it.

...CERTIFIED QUESTION...

She's answered that question. She's explained it five
times already. The fact that Counsel doesn't like the
answer, that's a different query.

MR. TEIN: Stop making speaking objections.

MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not. I'm not going to
put up with it, because it's in appropriate, Jack,
and you know it. I will not allow Counsel to
berate a witness, whether it's in a criminal case
or a civil case, whether my client or --

MR. TEIN: Calm down.

MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me.

No, I'm not going to allow it. That is not
proper.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay.

MR. LEOPOLD: If he wants to say that she's
lying after asking it five times and her
explaining in great detail, he can do that. But
I'm not going to allow her to answer, nor be
harassed by him. It's improper.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. But your response
that Counsel doesn't like the question -- or
doesn't like the answer -- just let me finish.

to interrupt you.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Just requires us to say we like the answer to that question. And it's not you and I or you and Mr. Tein who are testifying here. It's the witness.

MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. But after the sixth time of asking the same question and then coming back and pointing a finger at her and saying, "You're a liar" --

MR. TEIN: That didn't happen.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. But I'm not going to allow her to answer that question, because she's answered that same question and has explained it.

Now Counsel might be sitting there rubbing his head with a migraine. That's his problem. But if he can't ask a question appropriately in a professional manner, we will leave. I will not allow her to be berated like that.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Actually, we're very happy with the answer.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's great.

Q. And once the police showed up, to stop you from lying to avoid service, you made up another lie that the process servers had harassed you. Isn't that correct?

Q. And you've lied about your age on your MySpace pages, don't you?

A. Incorrect.

Q. All right. Let's look at Exhibit 26-01 one.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: 26-001?

MR. TEIN: Yes.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. On this page you lied to everyone that you were 18, didn't you?

MR. LEOPOLD: Just for the record, you're pointing to the photo.

THE WITNESS: I'm pointing to --

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. You're pointing to the one where it says your age is 18?

A. Correct.

Q. That's yours, right?

A. Correct. That's mine from a couple years ago that I have not been on, because I don't use that. Please keep going down, please. And I think that's it, because there's no one -- just that one is mine.

Q. So the one you pointed to where it says your age is 18, that's yours, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And when you wrote 18 as your age on your MySpace page, that was a lie, wasn't it?

A. Correct.

Q. Did you lie about your MySpace page back then because you couldn't post on MySpace unless you were 18?

A. Correct. There was a rule many years ago that you had to be 18 to have a MySpace.

Q. So you lied about your age so you could post on MySpace, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's go back to the top one on this page, 33-01. Are you testifying now under oath that this MySpace page where the headline says, "Twins do have more fun," and the location is given as Lox, abbreviation for Loxahatchee, and the age is 19, and it says __________, is it your testimony that you did not post that?

A. Correct.

Q. Now let's go back to the one that you were pointing to before on this page, where it says your age is 18 and you lied about your age to post MySpace, okay?

A. Uh-huh, yes.

Q. All right. Why did you finally put your true age on your MySpace profile four days before you were scheduled to testify before the Grand Jury?

A. I don't know what you're talking about.

MR. LEOPOLD: If you don't understand, ask him to ask the question again.

Q. The MySpace page that you're just pointing to, where it says you were 18.

A. Yes.

Q. And you were lying about your age, right?

A. Uh-huh.

Q. Why did you finally post your true age on your MySpace profile --

A. Uh --

Q. -- four days before you were scheduled to testify before the Grand Jury?

A. I honestly don't know which MySpace, because I've had like a bazillion MySpaces, and in that year, I had two, that one and another one, and that one's been deleted. So I don't know which one you're referring to.

Q. You remember that you changed your age on your MySpace page from 18 to your true age just four days before you went and testified in the Grand Jury?

A. No.

Q. You don't remember that.

A. No.

Q. Do you remember Detective Recarey? Did you

ever meet a Detective Recarey?

A. I don't know the names.

Q. How many different detectives have you met with on this case from Palm Beach?

A. Probably a good six or seven, maybe.

Q. Did one of the detectives tell you before you testified in the Grand Jury that you should take your MySpace age and put your true age?

A. No.

Q. Didn't Detective Recarey have to come to your house to pick you up to get you to testify in front of the Grand Jury?

A. Possibly; maybe because I didn't have a ride; I was only 14 or 15 at the time.

Q. Your mom didn't drive you?

A. No.

Q. Stepmom didn't drive you?

A. I think my dad. Oh, my dad; my dad drove me.

Q. Your dad drove you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So your testimony is Detective Recarey did not drive you, correct?

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Did any detective tell you to change your age on your MySpace page, to put your true age?

A. No, sir.

Q. Now you also lied on your MySpace page about your income, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you lied, saying that you made a quarter million dollars a year and higher, correct?

A. As a joke, yes.

Q. That was a lie, wasn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also lied on your MySpace page, saying that you were married, didn't you?

A. Possibly. And that might have been an error on my part.

Q. Now you also lie to the police, don't you?

A. No.

accused Mr. Epstein of attempting to murder your father, didn't you?

A. No. I never heard a statement saying that Mr. Epstein tried to murder my father.

Q. You made that statement, didn't you?

MR. LEOPOLD: Do you have a statement to show her? That's been asked and answered.

MR. TEIN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the witness' answer, Mr. Leopold.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. [REDACTED] you told the police, didn't you, that Mr. Epstein almost killed your father, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. Three years ago, before Mr. Epstein even knew about this investigation, you told the police that Epstein had "already come to my dad's house and did something to my dad's tires and my dad almost died. I didn't want my dad to get hurt, because Jeff already almost killed him."

Didn't you say that?

A. Not to my knowledge or recollection. I have never said anything like that.

Q. That would have been a complete lie, wouldn't it have been?

A. Yeah.

A. Did you say involuntarily?

Q. And you went there because you were lying so much, no one could control you; isn't that correct?
A. That's very incorrect.

Q. And isn't it true that your father has accused you of lying?

A. All the time.

Q. Didn't your father throw you out of the house Thanksgiving of this past year because you were lying so much to him?

A. Yes, he did kick me out. No, that's not the reasons why.

Q. Didn't your father throw your sister Amber out of the house, too?

A. Yes.

Q. And he threw her out of the house the week after Thanksgiving, right?

A. I don't know the date, but sure.

Q. Sounds about right?

A. Sure.

Q. And the reason he threw her out of the house was because she was lying, too?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation.

Q. Your father threw out of the house because she was lying, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. LEOPOLD: Just so the record is clear, the father -- because the mother was up north.

MR. TEIN: Don't testify, Counsel.

MR. LEOPOLD: So the record is clear, just the father. The mother was --

MR. TEIN: Counsel, don't coach and testify, please. That's absolutely improper.

MR. LEOPOLD: You just asked the wrong question.

MR. TEIN: You can't coach her that way and you well know it.

MR. LEOPOLD: For the record, it's the father. He's remarried, I think on his third marriage.

MR. TEIN: You cannot -- it's absolutely, totally against the rules and you know it.

MR. LEOPOLD: The natural mother lives in Georgia.

MR. TEIN: You need to behave yourself, lawyer.

You object. You know the rules. You just lectured me about the rules, Counsel. So why don't you play by the rules? Or only when they fit you? Why don't you grandstand a little more now. Give us a five-minute speech, Mr. Leopold.

MR. LEOPOLD: Are you finished, for the record?

MR. LEOPOLD: Hold it. Don't say anything yet. Let me --

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. Your parents, who filed the police report are also liars.

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer the question. We're not going to answer until I make the record. I want to put on the record, now that Counsel appears to be finished with his comments for the record, that the previous question was inappropriate, was intentionally misleading.

THE WITNESS: When you say parents, my mom is not, but sure, yeah, my dad has been to jail for lying.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Your dad went to federal prison for two years for lying, right?

A. Correct.

Q. Did he tell you it was for a financial fraud?

A. Yes.

Q. For stealing money from some financial institution?

Q. And your father filed a lawsuit, the first lawsuit for fifty million dollars against Mr. Epstein without consulting you, correct?

Q. And your father had a lawyer file the first lawsuit on your behalf for fifty million dollars against Mr. Epstein without your knowledge, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you don't trust your father, do you?

A. Correct.

Q. And you believe he's trying to manipulate you for his own gain, don't you?

A. Sort of.

Q. Well, you know that your mother filed a statement, an affidavit, saying that you don't trust your father and that you believe he's trying to manipulate you for his own gain; isn't that correct?

5. A. I would like to clarify something. You keep saying my Epstein lawsuit money. I don't have any money, and it's just a lawsuit at the moment. So I just don't trust her.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. [REDACTED] before you met Jeffrey Epstein, had you ever had sexual intercourse?

A. Yes, yeah.

Q. How many times?

A. Just a few. Twice.

Q. With how many different men?

A. Two.

Q. How old were they?

A. Zack Bryan, being one year older than me, and then the other person was two years older than me.

Q. What was his name?

A. Ryan Ortell.

Q. How old were you when you first had sexual intercourse?

A. 14.

Q. How many -- before you met Epstein, how many different men had you had any type of sexual activity with?

A. Just those two.

Q. Before you met Epstein, had you ever had oral sex?

A. No.

Q. Ever in your life, have you exchanged sex for something of value?

A. No.

MR. TEIN: We're done.

MR. LEOPOLD: We'll read.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: I don't have any questions. Thank you.

MR. LEOPOLD: Before we go off the record, it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can correct the record -- but we have stipulated that color copies of the documents that were identified for identification certainly will be attached to the deposition and counsel will be taking the photographs across street so that they can be

laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the deposition.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Done.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. If not, then I want to pull each one out and put exhibit labels on them, which we should do before we leave.

MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do either. I'll have copies sent to the court reporter and she can attach them to the deposition.

MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree to what we talked about during the break then.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what your asking me to do. Let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies and then I'll give those to the court reporter, fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that process. I would send copies to the court reporter. But if it will make you happier --

happier if I go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office
and make a copy of those photos that were part of
this deposition and then I'll give them to the
court reporter, I'll be happy to do it.

MR. LEOPOLD: I trust you implicitly,
however you with to do it. However, the
documents, before they leave this room, need to
have an exhibit sticky on them with the
appropriate --

MR. GOLDBERGER: Want to go get some? We
don't have any.

MR. LEOPOLD: I will do that. Excuse me.
Let me finish the record, please. You can't do
that to the court reporter. She's going to stroke
out. You can't do that. You have to let me --

are the most long-winded lawyer I've ever seen in
my life. Finish your sentence.

his voice, please.

going to be a period at the end of the sentence or

is it just going to be comma after comma after comma?

Go ahead, lawyer.

MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, I can't prevent you from taking them, but I will object and I will be bringing it to the court for sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of the room without them being marked. I want them marked, because you cannot identify in the record what was used. And with all due respect to Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this deposition is going, I do not want to rely on Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate exhibits. I will not do that. I cannot prevent you from taking them. But if you do, I will be bringing the matter to the court with appropriate sanctions, because that is improper. That is improper. When you use something in a deposition, they are to be marked. And you have refused to do that throughout for what ever reason.

MR. TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your sentence because you're talking about something you have no idea.

Every single one is marked, Ted. Every single one is already marked. But you want to

argue about everything. Ever single one is already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this and I have never had an argument over this.

MR. TEIN: You've made -- Ted, you are obstructionist, you are a liar. You have lied and misrepresented things, for the record. You are grandstanding.

MR. LEOPOLD: You need to back up.

MR. TEIN: No, no. I'm going to finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: You can finish, but don't hover over me.

MR. TEIN: No one is hovering over you. Stop trying to make a lying record. Let me say something else.

Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about the fact -- be quiet. Be quiet and let me finish. You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a complete and utter lie -- that you were unavailable this morning because you had a hearing. That was a lie.

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at --

MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at me.

MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold, let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't raise your voice either.

MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --

MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, do you want to take care of this?

MR. TEIN: Let me finish my sentence. The exhibits are marked. We are walking out of here. You are someone who misrepresents the record. It is absolutely atrocious what you do. That is not how a lawyer should behave. This deposition is over. You will get your exhibits, Mr. Leopold.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I understand what you're saying, Michael, and I understand Ted's position. Just so there's -- we're going to have lots

of issues in this case. We're going to have lots of reasons to disagree.

I'm going to take it over now and I'm going to make copies and I'm going to give them to Ms. Consor. If you want to go find some exhibit labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my guest. But that's what I'm offering to do.

THE WITNESS: Let me say two things, because I am happy to always disagree, and with you, I have no problem; we could always do it professionally. I have not problem.

I want to say two things so the record is very clear.

Since for whatever reason I have not been able to look at exhibits, because they have been refused to have been shown to me --

MR. TEIN: That's a lie.

MR. LEOPOLD: -- Jack, if you represent that the documents have the appropriate exhibit numbers or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, whatever they may be, then you can take them, make copies, send me a copy, make sure the court reporter gets a copy and then send me a bill for my copies, that's fine. I didn't know that they are marked that way because I haven't been able to

look at them.

MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded, and the number that we've made reference to in the deposition coincides with the barcoding.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. Eight by eleven color laser copies are fine.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: The State Attorneys Office is not going to charge anybody for color copies I print out.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. He's going to take them back to his office.

Secondly -- and I will be more than happy to do it, because it sounds like you all know more about it than I -- but I'm happy to get affidavits from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about what happened with this hearing today, because I know very little about it. But my representations are what they are.

MR. GOLDBERGER: They stay --

MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just finish for the record.

My representations or comments about what happened, representation about this hearing this morning, I know very little about it. I --

that.

MR. LEOPOLD: No, no, no. I just put it on the record. I will get an affidavit -- I'm assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. Pincus. I have no clue about what happened and why it was canceled. All I was told when I was out of town yesterday was that the hearing this morning was cancelled.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word for it.

MR. LEOPOLD: If you want an affidavit, I'll get it for you.

MR. GOLDBERGER: It's a personal issue for me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it was done just because it wasn't convenient for you, then I'm offended by that. But if you're telling me that it was planned and it didn't happen, I'll take your word for it.

MR. LEOPOLD: I am more than happy to get you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm assuming since my deposition was taken for four hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am told it is being re-noticed. Why it was canceled,

I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more than happy to get it. But I don't know the reason why it was canceled.

MR. TEIN: I don't need it. But what I do take issue with is regardless of why it was canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, You know what? We can start earlier this morning.

MR. LEOPOLD: I owe you nothing.

MR. TEIN: I don't care. Don't interrupt me.

Because Jack canceled his vacation plans because of you.

MR. GOLDBERGER: That's all right, that's all right.

MR. TEIN: And you're selfish. And this deposition is over. Good-by Mr. Leopold.
