(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)
Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) at the MCC a request for the preservation of any and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic communication data, tape recordings, logs, notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would be in the possession of the MCC, its Warden, their legal counsel, the USMS, the FBI, the Inspector General, the USAO for the SDNY or any other federal or relevant state or city agency that relate to Jeffrey Epstein's imprisonment/detention since July 6, 2019 and that relate particularly but not exclusively to the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated as an attempted suicide by the MCC and the events relating to his death on August 10, 2019. The request encompasses but is not limited to any videos of the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during the evening of August 9 through the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of the cell itself during that time period, records of the identities of (i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) who were on duty from midnight through 8 AM on August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. Epstein was incarcerated during this time period, records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all photographs of Mr. Epstein or his cell taken on August 10, 2019, any and all electronic or tape recordings or records of any internal communications within the MCC or any external communications by MCC staff on August 9 and August 10, 2019, records of any mental health interviews or assessments of Mr. Epstein at anytime during his detention, records of any decision to put him on or take Mr Epstein off suicide watch, photos of his cell taken on or before August 9 or on or after August 10, 2019, memoranda of

Additionally, we would request the preservation of any note or notes found in Mr. Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, any ligature or other physical evidence related to his cause of death, any bedding, any medication or vitamins, any log showing who entered or were present in the MCC for the 12 hour period before 6:30 AM on August 10, 2019, as well as a list of inmates who were in Mr. Epstein's unit during the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 2019.

Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff. The FBI is investigating the incident.

Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy.

Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there:

was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jailâ€™s normal procedure, two officials said.

5. Whatâ€™s protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?

Hi—

b)(6)(d)(7)(C) from the Washington Post here. We are in the process of working on a story about the cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein’s cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in those cameras was found to be corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further analysis.

Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC? Are you able to say what other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that Mr. Epstein killed himself?

Hi Darrin

At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan) concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel obviously didn't know that Adam &amp; I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's co-conspirators to be charged &amp; brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Thanks,

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:

1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr [baff] [biz7jC]

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [baff] [biz7jC] and Mr. Plourde, where Mr. Plourde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Office [baff] told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [baff] or Mr. Plourde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Plourde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9 south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Hi there –
I understand officials may have given a statement yesterday on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein was on suicide watch.
Are you able to confirm whether or not he was or might you have a statement regarding the issue that you sent to others?
I appreciate it, on behalf of CBS News.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Epstein status hearing

Hi Darrin
Hi Darrin

At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan) concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel obviously didn't know that Adam &amp; I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.



<!-- Chunk 3 of 20 -->

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's co-conspirators to be charged &amp; brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last

Friday with (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (9)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (9)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

Hi [Date: 2019/08/07 13:11]

I will notify Unit Team of the below. I understand he has had two calls so far, but am not sure his phone account was fully activated yet.

Thank you,

[Date: 2019/08/07 13:11]

I understand that Mr. Epstein has not yet had the opportunity to establish a telephone account. Unit Mgr. [Date: 2019/08/07 13:11] began the process last week, but did not have a chance to finish it. If you could arrange for someone to help Mr. Epstein set up the account, we'd really appreciate it.

Thank you for all your help.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary

designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

Good afternoon Mr. [10(6), [c)]

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best,

Page 1633

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (606), (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (606) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (606) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9 south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Good morning Mr. Johnson,

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (m)(6) (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (m)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (m)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:

1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [6)(6), [6](7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [6](6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [6](6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Good morning Mr. [c] [d](d)(6)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [b)(6); (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [b)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [b)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Good afternoon Mr. [69(6).

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best,

Good Morning,

I/M Epstein # 76318-054 appeared on our SENTRY RELEASE report. Due to the nature of the situation, I am waiting for further instructions on how to proceed with releasing his funds. On a normal basis the process is to forward the funds to the address located in SENTRY. The inmates account balance ($566.27) Please see the attached P.S. 4500.12 on proper procedures for deceased inmates along with the SENTRY address on file.

Funds found in an institution that cannot be attributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the Accounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement **Imprest Funds, Collections, and Deposits**.

## 8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES' FUNDS

If an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be distributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state. If the inmate dies with monies due from the United States, payment is not authorized except to a legal representative of the estate or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution of the state of domicile (most recent legal residence).

a. **Claims for Funds of Deceased Inmates.** Claims received against funds of deceased inmates are handled at the institution level per 4 GAO 3500. Institutions should submit claims to the Trust Fund Branch Deposit Fund Section for GAO settlement only when doubt exists as to:

- The amount or validity of the claim.
- The person(s) properly entitled to payment under the laws of the domicile of the descendant.

In such cases, the institution transmittal shall explain that doubt exists, and is accompanied by a Claim Against the United States for Amounts Due in the Case of A Deceased Creditor (SF-1055) and/or Acknowledgment of Inmate, Part 3 &amp; 4 (BP-A0408) and a copy of the death certificate.

If there is urgent need for payment of a balance under $100 in a deceased inmate’s account, and if conditions as outlined in the paragraph above are satisfied, the amount may be disbursed from TRUFACS with the Trust Fund Branch Chief’s written approval. Copies of the BP-A0408 are attached to such vouchers in lieu of the usual withdrawal request. Documentation is attached to the payment in TRUFACS through the document imaging process.

b. **Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates.** Procedures for processing “whereabouts unknown” inmates are followed when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no relatives or claimants for the funds.

## 8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS

Encumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given before any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately. An encumbrance may be made for various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release, disciplinary measures, inmate’s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden’s discretion or the result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order. This authority is not delegated below the Associate Warden. Funds the Warden encumbers may only be released upon his/her approval or upon inmate release.

P4500.12 3/14/18 Federal Regulations from 28 CFR: this type. Implementing instructions: this type.

Epstein status hearing
TEXT.htm

At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan) concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel obviously didn't know that Adam &amp; I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's co-conspirators to be charged &amp; brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Good morning Mr. [DATE: (DACT): 01/07/2019],

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last

Friday with (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (b)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (b)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Good morning Mr. (R) (R) (D) (T) (C)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (R) (R) (D) (T) (C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (R) (R) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (R) (R) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9 south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Mr. [ba0]
Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you and [ba0; (b)(7)(C)] at the MCC a request for the preservation of any and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic communication data, tape recordings, logs, notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would be in the possession of the MCC, its Warden, their legal counsel, the USMS, the FBI, the Inspector General, the USAO for the SDNY or any other federal or relevant state or city agency that relate to Jeffrey Epstein's imprisonment/detention since July 6, 2019 and that relate particularly but not exclusively to the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated as an attempted suicide by the MCC and the events relating to his death on August 10, 2019. The request encompasses but is not limited to any videos of the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during the evening of August 9 through the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of the cell itself during that time period, records of the identities of (i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) who were on duty from midnight through 8 AM on August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. Epstein was incarcerated during this time period, records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all photographs of Mr. Epstein or his cell taken on August 10, 2019, any and all electronic or tape recordings or records of any internal communications within the MCC or any external communications by MCC staff on August 9 and August 10, 2019, records of any mental health interviews or assessments of Mr. Epstein at anytime during his detention, records of any decision to put him on or take Mr Epstein off suicide watch, photos of his cell taken on or before August 9 or on or after August 10, 2019, memoranda of interviews with any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23 or on August 9-10, 2019 relating to Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC

Additionally, we would request the preservation of any note or notes found in Mr. Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, any ligature or other physical evidence related to his cause of death, any bedding, any medication or vitamins, any log showing who entered or were present in the MCC for the 12 hour period before 6:30 AM on August 10, 2019, as well as a list of inmates who were in Mr. Epstein's unit during the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 2019.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi (d/f), (b)(7)(C)

Thank you for letting me know and for your response.

I was informed by (d/f), (b)(7)(C) that he had submitted my completed application to the legal department for the inmate Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your records? If not, I will be happy to resubmit. If so, can I send the application to you directly via email? Please let me know.

Thanks again,

Hello (d/f), (b)(7)(C)

I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. I was told today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.

I really appreciate your help.

Thank you,

Good morning (b)(6)

My apologies, but I have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. I received your voicemails regarding the status of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family as expeditiously as possible.

If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to chat further.

Thank you,

Good morning Mr [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last

Friday with (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (b)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (b)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

No worries. Thank you for the update.

Just to clarify, this means that until my application is cleared I will be unable to visit Mr. Epstein, correct?

Hi (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

Thank you for letting me know and for your response.

I was informed by (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) that he had submitted my completed application to the legal department for the inmate Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your records? If not, I will be happy to resubmit. If so, can I send the application to you directly via email? Please let me know.

Thanks again,

Hello! b)(6):

I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. I was told today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.

I really appreciate your help.

Thank you,

Good afternoon Mr. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Good morning (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

With apologies for the delay, medical staff can accept his CPAP machine. Would you or one of your associates be able to bring it in next week? It must be provided to medical staff rather than directly to your client.

Thank you,

(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)
@gmail.com&gt; 7/26/2019 9:50 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;

Mr. (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

Is Mr. Epstein approved to receive a CPAP machine? If so, should we send it directly to him through the inmate mail system? Please confirm.

Thank you.

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (b)(6) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (b)(6) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

(b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

The staff member conducting intake screening shall advise the pretrial inmate, depending upon the design, structure, and operation of the individual institution, that the inmate may have contact with convicted inmates. The inmate is to be asked to sign the appropriate portion in Section II of this Pretrial Inmate Work Waiver/Notice of Separation. If the inmate refuses to sign this segment of the form, staff shall document this refusal on the form.

A pretrial inmate who wishes to waive the exemption from work must sign the appropriate portion in Section IV of this Pretrial Inmate Work Waiver/Notice of Separation. This form must be completed prior to the issuance of a work assignment. If the inmate’s behavior suggests an inability to comprehend the waiver, or if the inmate has been admitted to a mental health referral for evaluation or treatment, the inmate must be referred to a mental health professional for an assessment as to competency to sign the waiver. The waiver may be rescinded at the inmate’s request and reasons for the rescission should be documented in Section V of this form and signed by a staff member. The waiver shall be maintained in the inmate’s unit file or record office file and will remain in the file as a permanent document. The inmate may be given a copy of this form if the inmate so requests.

## II. NOTICE OF SEPARATION

A. I understand that it is possible that I will have contact with inmates already convicted of a crime. I am/am not (circle one) aware of any reason why my having contact with convicted prisoners would pose a threat to my safety or the safety of others.

Hello (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. I was told today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.

I really appreciate your help.

Thank you,

# I. INTRODUCTION

The Metropolitan Correctional Center, in New York, New York (MCC New York), is owned and operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau), an agency of the United States (U.S.) Department of Justice. The primary mission of MCC New York is to serve federal courts in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York by providing pretrial detention in conjunction with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS).

This guide outlines the relevant policies and procedures applicable to attorneys representing defendants incarcerated at MCC New York. The procedures cover issues such as legal visiting, attorney-client communication, and release of information.

## II. PRETRIAL DETENTION

MCC New York staff are aware of the importance of the institution's pretrial detention mission. MCC New York staff are expected to act in a professional manner and are governed by a code of employee conduct. Attorneys who feel that they have been treated unprofessionally by a staff member are asked to put their complaint in writing to the Warden's Office, MCC New York, 150 Park Row, New York, NY 10007. All complaints will be looked into and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.

In turn, our staff appreciate the professionalism and courtesy expected from attorneys and other officers of the court. Attorneys are expected not only to abide by the Attorney Guide, but generally to act in a professional manner. In addition, all visitors are expected to refrain from using profanity and keep their voices at a conversational level when speaking with staff, inmates and other visitors. All visitors, including attorneys, are prohibited from using cell phones within the institution, including the lobby.

All visitors, including attorneys, who violate MCC New York's visiting rules, create disturbances at the institution or in any way jeopardize the security or orderly operation of the institution may have their visiting privileges restricted or suspended.

The information contained in this Guide is meant to be a general guideline and is not all-inclusive. We cannot envision every circumstance that could occur, and thus the Guide does not contain the answers to all questions. For example, in the event of an institution emergency, security needs of the institution will override any portion of this Attorney Guide.

## A. Legal Visiting

### 1. Visiting Hours

Legal visitation hours are as follows:

Monday-Sunday (including Federal Holidays) 8:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m.

Visits during these hours do not need to be scheduled in advance. Special legal visits outside of these hours may be requested through MCC New York's Legal Department with at least 24 hours notice (The Legal Department is open Monday-Friday 7:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m. so a request for Monday must be in by the preceding Friday). Requests should be faxed to: "(646) 836-7665, Attn: Legal Department." Every effort will be made to accommodate such requests, but final approval is contingent upon the

availability of staff. In the event an attorney requires an emergency visit outside normal legal visiting hours and has not pre-requested it, he/she must contact the Operations Lieutenant.

If there is any problem with a legal visit during off duty hours, attorneys should ask to speak with the Institution Duty Officer or Operations Lieutenant.

## 2. Attorney Processing

MCC New York conducts a daily count of all inmates at 4:00 p.m., with an additional count at 10:00 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays. Additional unscheduled counts may also occur in emergencies. During a count, inmates must be at their assigned cell or bunk, unless the inmate has been authorized to be in another area. In order to guarantee an accurate count, a request that an inmate remain in the visiting room during the count must be made at least one hour before the count, i.e., 3:00 p.m. for the 4:00 p.m. count and 9:00 a.m. for the 10:00 a.m. count. When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed on the "out count" and will be required to remain in the visiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who have not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal visits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:30 p.m. and 9:30 a.m. Attorneys who arrive at the institution within an hour before the start of a count, i.e., after 3:00 p.m. or 9:00 a.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the count clears.

Counts usually take approximately 30-40 minutes to clear. During this time, all movement in the institution ceases. Consequently, attorneys and/or their representatives will not be allowed to enter or exit the Visiting Room during official counts. Visits should be scheduled accordingly to avoid unnecessary delays.

## 3. Identification

To receive attorney entrance privileges, an individual must be able to establish his or her status as an attorney by presenting identification that verifies active membership in any state bar. Excluding Legal Aid Society Federal Defender's, NY State Attorneys are required to have a Secure Pass Identification card for entrance. Upon notification that a NY State attorney is not in possession of a Secure Pass, and upon approval from the Legal Department, attorneys will be permitted to enter the institution for 60 days from their date of approval without the Secure Pass.

If an attorney is licensed in a state other than New York, he/she must contact the legal department at least 24 hours in advance so that their status as an attorney in good standing may be verified. Provided the Legal Department can verify the attorney's status, the attorney will be added on a list located in the lobby, authorizing the attorney's entrance for a one year

Page 4 of 22

period with government issued picture identification, such as a drivers license. It is ultimately the attorney's responsibility to establish his or her membership in a State Bar.

After completing the Notification to Visitor form, attorneys must be processed through the metal detector, have their hand stamped and sign the bound logbook before being allowed entry into the institution. By signing the Notification to Visitor forms, attorneys certify that they are not carrying firearms, explosives, weapons, ammunition, metal cutting tools, recording equipment, cellular phones, cameras, food items, narcotics, marijuana, alcoholic beverages, prescription drugs or any other item deemed contraband. All legal materials and briefcases will be searched for contraband and processed through the fluoroscope. Handbags, newspapers, portable telephones, and non-legal materials are not permitted in the Visiting Room.

**Official Visitors:** Federal employees, including Assistant U.S. Attorneys, law enforcement officers, U.S. Court officials, U.S. Probation Officers, and Assistant Federal Public Defenders, will be permitted to visit upon presentation of appropriate identification. All visitors must present official identification, sign in and out of the logbook, and pass through the metal detector.

## 4. Property Brought into the Visiting Room

### Legal Material

An attorney may bring into the visiting room legal materials related to an inmate's case, including CDs, or audio/videotapes as well as dollar bills for the vending machines. An attorney (not a paralegal, investigator, mitigation specialist or interpreter) will be authorized to provide a reasonable (not to exceed four inches) amount of legal materials to the inmate at the conclusion of the attorney visit. The inmate will be allowed to take these legal materials with him/her to his/her unit after the Officer determines the items are of a legal nature and he/she inspects them for contraband. Legal materials should not be read for content but examined only to determine that they are indeed legal materials and they are free of contraband. Inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) will be allowed to take legal materials to their unit minus folders, paperclips, staples, rubber bands, or any other items that could be considered a security concern. All other materials, including cellular phones, pagers, newspapers, magazines, tissues, wallets and keys, are prohibited and must be secured in a lobby locker before entering the secure confines of the institution.

Additionally, legal videos, CDs and audio tapes, cannot be provided to an inmate during a legal visit but may be placed in the Lobby legal mail drop box for delivery to the inmate. Mail deposited in these boxes must be small enough to fit through the

Page 5 of 22

opening of the box. Larger packages may be broken down into several smaller envelopes. These boxes are emptied Monday-Friday, excluding federal holidays, and the contents are processed with other mail received from the post office that day. Envelopes must be clearly marked with the attorney's name (including language that identifies that person as an attorney), inmate's name and register number and the following statement: "SPECIAL MAIL-OPEN ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE INMATE." See below, page 12. Unauthorized items found in the inmate's possession will be treated as contraband.

Tape Players, VCRs &amp; Computers to Review Discovery Material

Due to security concerns, attorneys may not bring electronic equipment into the secure confines of the institution. However, MCC New York has tape players, VCRs and televisions for attorneys to review discovery materials with clients in visiting rooms. These items are available on a first come, first served basis by oral request to the visiting room officer.

MCC New York also has a computer that attorneys may use to review computer CDs with their clients. The computer is available during attorney visiting hours and should be reserved at least 24 hours in advance by calling the Legal Department. Attorneys who make an appointment to use the computer will have preference over those who do not make an appointment. Attorneys should bring a copy of the CD discovery when meeting with an inmate.

Audio and video cassettes and CDs may also be mailed directly to an inmate via the legal mail procedures explained below in the Legal Mail section, C1. Inmates may review their DVD and CD-Rom discovery material as described in the Law Library Section, E1.

5. Private Conference Rooms

These rooms are available on a first come, first served basis. There are twelve conference rooms in the building. Institutional security and fire safety regulations restrict the total number of people that may be in the visiting room at any one time. Ultimately, it is a correctional decision where any visit will take place.

6. Multiple Client Visits

Attorneys are not limited in the number of inmates they may visit in one day. However, only one inmate may be brought down to the visiting room at any time. Please see below in Separation/Codefendant Meeting Section 11 for instruction on Co-Defendant Meetings. When an attorney has finished the legal visit and the inmate has been sent back to the unit, another inmate may be brought down to the visiting room.

Page 6 of 22

Approved legal representatives (law clerk, paralegal, interpreter, investigator, psychologist, and other experts) may accompany an attorney into the Visiting Room. If visiting independently, representatives must follow the requirements set forth in the "Legal Representatives" section below. See Section 8.

Attorneys are ordinarily not permitted to bring material witnesses into the Visiting Room. Prior approval to do so must be received from the Warden and requires a court order. Written requests for such approval should clearly outline the specific circumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be approved if alternative arrangements are available to defense counsel.

## 7. Dress Code

All visitors, including attorneys, are required to dress in a manner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively provocative, immodest or revealing attire is reason to deny visiting. Visitors over the age of 12 will not be allowed into the institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses exceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through clothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that reveals the midriff area, low-cut shirts or blouses, revealing front and/or backless clothing, skin-tight clothing, spandex clothing and sweat pants are not allowed. Furthermore, clothing which may impede identification (e.g., hoods) or easily hide contraband (e.g., coats) present security concerns and are also prohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shower shoes, flip-flops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind) and undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has delegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision-making authority regarding what attire is appropriate inside the Visiting Room. If the Duty Officer is not available, the Operations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A memorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby of MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to familiarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.

## 8. Legal Representatives

Attorneys are allowed to visit their clients upon providing evidence of their professional status. However, attorneys often need other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters, mitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their clients in connection with legal representation. These individuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to attorneys and must first submit an application (See ATTACHMENT A) signed by a sponsoring attorney and pass a background check before being granted permission to enter MCC New York.

Page 7 of 22

Once approved, the individual will be included on a list maintained in the lobby and allowed to enter the institution for one year with appropriate government issued ID. The entry application may be requested from and mailed to the Legal Departments of either MCC New York or MDC Brooklyn. Once approved the individual may enter both institutions.

For mitigation specialists, every time they visit the institution for a new inmate, they must submit a court order to the Legal Department which authorizes them to enter the institution to visit with that specific inmate. Upon reapplying at the end of their one year entry period, mitigation specialists and doctors are required to produce a new order, reflecting the new year.

## 9. Polygraphs

The Warden may permit polygraph tests in connection with state or federal criminal felony investigations. See 28 C.F.R. §551.71. Polygraph tests in connection with misdemeanor offenses, civil proceedings, or any other matters are generally disapproved, absent a federal court order. See Id. Requests for polygraph examinations must be submitted to the Legal Department with approval by the Warden. The written request should include at least the following information:

(1) Inmate's name and register number;
(2) Case caption, case number and nature of matter;
(3) Requested date and time;
(4) Expected length of polygraph;
(5) Name, title, and organization of each person attending (all non-attorneys and non-legal representatives will have to fill out an application so MCC can complete a background check (See ATTACHMENT B);
(6) List of all equipment to be used; and
(7) Indication of whether the inmate's consent has been obtained.

The Warden must be able to confirm the validity of the request and the inmate being examined must give written consent on a form provided for that purpose. Requesters are responsible for meeting all state and local requirements in administering the test.

## 10. Depositions

Requests for Depositions for state matters, both civil and criminal, must be submitted to the Legal Department for review. All deposition requests must be made in writing and include the following information:

(1) Inmate's name and register number;
(2) A court order or similar court signed document for the

Page 8 of 22

deposition;

(3) Case caption, case number and nature of matter;
(4) Requested date and time;
(5) Expected length of deposition;
(6) Name, title, and organization of each person attending (all non-attorneys and non-legal representatives must fill out an application so MCC can complete a background check (See Attachment B));
(7) List of all equipment to be used; and
(8) Indication of whether the inmate's consent has been obtained.

Video or tape recorders are not allowed inside the institution. Furthermore, all equipment is subject to inspection prior to entering the institution.

## 11. Separation Assignments/Co-Defendant Meetings

Co-defendant meetings must be requested at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, e.g. for a meeting on Tuesday at 2:00 P.M., the request must be submitted by Monday at 2:00 P.M. Written requests should be faxed to the MCC New York Legal Department, (646) 836-7665, and should include the names of everyone attending the meeting, including, but not limited to, attorneys, paralegals, interpreters, investigators, co-defendants on bail and co-defendants at MCC New York. Please indicate which attorney represents each inmate. Also, please include with the request a copy of the first page of the indictment showing that the requested parties are co-defendants. This must be provided every time a meeting is requested.

Separation Orders: An inmate with a "separation order" is prohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or she is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a co-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be accommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies the institution that the separation does not apply to co-defendant meetings. However, if the inmates have been separated due to security concerns, whether based on information developed by an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the discretion to not allow the meeting. Attorneys who are aware of separation orders between co-defendants should include with their request the name and phone number of the AUSA assigned to the case in question. These requests should be made as far in advance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the responsible Assistant United States Attorney cannot be contacted.

For co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from MCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the responsibility of the defense attorney to contact the responsible Assistant United States Attorney, who will, in turn, contact the USMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of Prisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.

Page 9 of 22

The request for the meeting should be sent to both MCC and MDC Legal Departments. MDC Brooklyn's Legal Department fax number is (718) 840-4250.

## 12. Foreign Attorneys

Attorneys who are not licensed in a state or jurisdiction of the United States must provide verification of their status as a licensed attorney in good standing in a foreign jurisdiction, prior to their initial visit. Foreign attorneys should contact their respective Consulate Office, who will provide the attorney official documentation (raised seal for most countries) stating that the individual is in fact an attorney in good standing in that country. The attorney must provide to the MCC New York Legal Department, the original letter from his or her consulate verifying the foreign attorney's status as a licensed attorney in good standing. Once the status of the foreign attorney has been confirmed, that attorney will be processed as a legal visitor for future visits for one year only. The attorney may request to be placed on the list on an annual basis by following the above described procedure.

## 13. Social Visitors

See www.bop.gov, MCC New York Visiting Regulations.

## B. Telephone Calls

### 1. Unmonitored Telephone Calls

Inmates may place unmonitored telephone calls to their attorneys. See 28 C.F.R. §540.105; and Program Statement 5264.07, Sec.8, Telephone Regulations for Inmates. All housing units, excluding Special Housing Unit (SHU), have access to unmonitored telephones with a direct connection to the SDNY Federal Public Defenders' Office. Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a direct connection to the EDNY Federal Public Defenders' Office. If the inmate's attorney cannot be contacted on the provided telephones, the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff assistance in writing. The Unit Team staff will review the request, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit Team's unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an unmonitored attorney call, the inmate or the inmate's attorney must request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other correspondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.

Inmate requests for unmonitored attorney calls are carefully reviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected. Frequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate's opportunity to pursue illegal activities without detection. Additionally, staff time and attention is unfairly focused on the single inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at the expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.

Page 10 of 22

An attorney may not call an inmate. Attorneys who need to speak with an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call them must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by letter. Similarly, attorneys may not fax documents to inmates or to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.

## 2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)

The Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as part of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28 C.F.R. §540.100, et seq., *Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for Inmate*; and Program Statement 5264.07, *Telephone Regulations for Inmates*. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of maintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an inmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a person of his or her choice outside the institution on a telephone provided for that purpose. However, limitations and conditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges to ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional management responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set forth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those limitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure the security or good order, including discipline, of the institution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate telephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction. See 28 C.F.R. Part 541.

Inmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on their approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers placed on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits the initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible. Inmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are assigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit Team.

Inmates are advised of the institution's telephone monitoring capability. See 28 C.F.R. §540.102. A notice is posted next to each inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored. Ordinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases the receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §540.105. Third party, conference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or other alternative call arrangements are not permitted, thus limiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for criminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the telephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which may result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases criminal charges.

Inmates may place attorneys on their approved telephone list. However, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such calls are not attorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking attorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored telephone call as described above in section B(1).

Page 11 of 22

Page 12 of 22

## 3. Emergency Telephone Calls

Inmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to a death or serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a request to the Religious Services Department. Likewise, if an individual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they should call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious Services Department.

## C. Legal Mail

All legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail addressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to sender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.

### 1. Legal Mail Envelopes:

The Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may receive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 540.18; and Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 5800.10, *Mail Management Manual* ("PS 5800.10"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides that special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of the inmate, will be treated as such "if the sender is adequately identified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is marked 'Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the inmate.'" 28 C.F.R. § 540.18(a). However, the presence of a return address with a firm name does not sufficiently identify the sender of the material as an attorney.

&gt; Specifically, the attorney must be adequately identified on the envelope as an attorney . . . The use of the title "Esquire" without additional indication of the sender's occupation does not establish the bearer as an attorney or legal aid supervisor. Mail from individuals using the title "Esquire" as the exclusive identification of their status shall not be handled as special mail, even if the envelope contains some special mail markings.

P.S. 5800.10, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handling of legal mail, strict compliance with these procedures will be enforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify legal mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm’s name) and their legal status (i.e., attorney), in the return address portion of the envelope. This information, in addition to writing elsewhere on the envelope "Special Mail - Open only in presence of inmate," will ensure that legal mail is treated as confidential attorney-client communication.

Page 13 of 22

2. Legal Mail Packages:

Bureau of Prisons policy requires that incoming inmate property packages be authorized in advance unless otherwise approved under another Bureau policy. Packages containing only legal material do not need to be pre-approved; however:

packages must be marked with words such as 'Authorized by Bureau Policy.' This is to alert mail room staff that enclosed materials contain matter which does not require prior approval. . . . A package received without an appropriately completed [authorization form], or without markings indicating authorized materials enclosed, is considered unauthorized and shall be returned to the sender.

PS 5800.10, Ch. 3, pp.8-9.

This additional marking, i.e., "Authorized by Bureau Policy," is only required on packages and should be in addition to the legal mail markings explained above. Any legal mail that is delivered in a box, a padded envelope or is wrapped in shipping paper is considered a package and will be handled pursuant to the above policy. An attorney who is unsure whether a legal shipment will be considered a package or an envelope should write "Authorized by Bureau Policy" to ensure that the shipment is not rejected.

(Note: An inmate who wishes to receive a non-legal material package from anyone, including an attorney, must contact a member of the Unit Team to complete the appropriate paperwork and receive approval.)

3. FedEx:

Attorneys should not send packages via FedEx because no inmate mail is received directly at MCC New York. Staff pick up all inmate mail at the United States Post Office. FedEx will only deliver to the actual prison and staff are prohibited from receiving a package for an inmate that is hand-delivered to MCC New York. Attorneys who wish to expedite the delivery of documents or materials to their clients are advised to pass them during a legal visit, place the materials in one of the institution's legal drop boxes or send the materials via the Postal Service's Express or Priority Mail services.

4. Stamps

Inmates may not receive stamps or stamped items other than issuance from the institution or by purchase from the commissary. 28 C.F.R. §540.21(j). These items will be treated as contraband

in the institution. Attorneys are permitted to send self-addressed envelope without affixed postage.

## 5. Court Clothing

Court clothing for trial can be delivered in one of two ways:

1) Prior to an individual bringing in clothes, it is the inmate's responsibility to submit an "Authorization to Receive A Package or Property BP-331" to his Unit Counselor. This form can be obtained from the inmate's Unit Team. The Unit Counselor will then deliver one copy of that form to the Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D) Department. The inmate will receive the other copies of that form so that he may mail one to the individual who will be dropping off the court clothes. The individual bringing the clothing should call R&amp;D staff in advance before dropping off clothes. Once authorized, they must bring the copy of the BP-331 form with the package and notify the lobby officer who will contact a staff member from the R&amp;D department. An R&amp;D staff member will then report to the lobby and accept the clothing.

2) A court order can be obtained in lieu of the BP-331 form mentioned above. A call to R&amp;D in advance of dropping the clothing must still be made. Inmates are allowed up to two sets of trial clothes.

## 6. Mail for multiple defendants

If a case involves several co-defendants who will need to view the same discovery material, the package/envelope of discovery must be addressed to the Legal Department, as described above, and the mailing must contain a cover letter indicating all inmates and Register Numbers who are to have access to this discovery material.

## D. Release of Records/Information

### 1. Subpoenas

Subpoenas for documents may be faxed to the MCC New York Legal Department at (646) 836-7665. Upon receipt of the fax, MCC New York will begin gathering the requested documents. Please be advised that the Privacy Act prohibits the release of any information pursuant to a subpoena without the written permission of the individual to whom the records pertain. This requirement applies to attorneys requesting documents about their clients. Therefore, an attorney must provide an original signed consent for release of information from his or her client along with any subpoena for information. Any records to which an inmate normally has access, i.e., the inmate's medical records and central file, will be provided directly to the

requesting attorney with the proper inmate consent. However, all other subpoenaed records will be provided to the United States Attorney's Office for a determination of whether to release the documents, pursuant to the Touhy regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq.

## 2. Medical Records

Medical records may be obtained by defense counsel with a Consent to Release Authorization signed by the inmate—the original consent form is required. The request can be mailed to the Legal Department. If the inmate is no longer assigned to MCC New York, then the requesting attorney must file a FOIA request to the following address:

Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Section
Office of General Counsel, Room 841
Federal Bureau of Prisons
320 First Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20534

Health Services staff are not at liberty to discuss information with an inmate's attorney related to that inmate's medical condition. Attorneys are encouraged to seek such information directly from their clients.

If a newly arriving inmate has prior non-Bureau medical records, you may send the materials to MCC New York, ATTN: Health Services Unit.

## E. Inmate Legal Activities

### 1. Law Library

The law library at MCC New York consists of legal books, electric typewriters, and computers on which inmates may access and view discovery material on CD-ROM format. The Education Department also provides copy machines for inmates to use in preparing any legal documents.

Typically, inmates at MCC New York may access the law library during their scheduled law library hours, which are one day a week, Monday through Thursday. Inmates should check the bulletin boards in their respective housing units for days and times scheduled. Inmates may sign up to access the law library between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 10:40 a.m., and from 12:30 p.m. through 3:30 p.m. Since MCC New York is a high-rise building, each floor is allowed access to the law library one day per week because many of the inmates must be separated from each other at all times for security purposes. In addition, inmates who are pro se or who have a demonstrated legal need, such as an imminent court deadline or an excessive amount of discovery material to

Page 15 of 22

review, may be granted an additional six hours of library time on Fridays by making a request to the Education Department. All requests for additional law library time are, of course, subject to staff availability, number of inmate requests, and security concerns. If the pretrial inmate is pro se, as in representing his/herself, the inmate should provide the Education Department with official court documentation verifying his/her status.

There is also a basic law library in the Special Housing Unit (SHU).

If the law library does not have the reference material the inmate needs to do the research, the inmate may consult with the Education Department staff on the possibility of requesting additional materials.

## 2. Access to Computerized Discovery Materials

MCC New York's law library has computers which inmates may access during their scheduled law library hours.

All electronic discovery materials must be sent in CD-ROM formats instead of DVD disks. MCC New York currently does not have the equipment to support DVDs. Material from DVD disks should be broken down and distributed onto several CDs. MCC New York computers have the capability to play industry standard audio or video files in the following formats:

1. video clips of AVI, MPG, MPEG, WMV
2. audio clips of WAV, MP3, WMA
3. documents in PDF form, HTML, TXT, JPG, DOC

Due to licensing issues, MCC New York does not support RealPlayer recorded audio or video formats, CD-RW disks, files made for a non-Microsoft computer (such as MacIntosh) or discovery in non-standard/proprietary format.

## 3. Leisure Library

All housing units have been assigned a time for utilizing the leisure library. Inmates should check the unit bulletin board for days and times scheduled.

## 4. Service of Process

Bureau staff are prohibited from effecting service of process on inmates. MCC New York policy requires that an inmate be served by a federal, state or local law enforcement official (Marshals or Sheriffs). Because service of process occurs within the secure confines of the institution, private process servers, who are not also law enforcement officials, may not serve inmates. The qualified process server must contact MCC New York's Inmate Systems Management department to schedule an appointment before coming to the institution.

Page 16 of 22

F. Administrative Remedy Program

It is imperative that inmates attempt to resolve any condition of confinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate staff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all housing units have bulletin boards that have information explaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions, etc.

The Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program is a process through which inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to virtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures have not resolved the matter. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 - Administrative Remedy; and Program Statement 1330.13, Administrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follows: (1) to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of Prisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally known as Community Corrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and (3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their confinement. See C.F.R. §542.10.

Inmates are obligated to attempt informal resolution of grievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative remedy. See 28 C.F.R. §542.13. The deadline for completion of informal resolution and submission of a formal written Administrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 20 calendar days following the date on which the basis for the Request occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.14. Once an inmate has filed a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the Warden of that facility has 20 calendar days to investigate and provide the inmate a written response. See 28 C.F.R. §542.18. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden's response, he/she has 20 calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-10). See 28 C.F.R. §542.15. Once received in the Regional Office, the Regional Director has 30 calendar days to investigate and provide the inmate a written response. See 28 C.F.R. §542.18. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional Director's response, he/she has 30 calendar days to file a Central Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-11). See 28 C.F.R. §15. Once received in the Central Office, the Administrator, National Inmate Appeals, has 40 days to investigate and provide the inmate a written response. 28 C.F.R. §542.18. After receiving the Administrator's response, the inmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program. The program provides for expedited investigations and responses in emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both filing grievances and receiving responses. At any level, an Administrative Remedy may be rejected if it does not fully comply with Program Statement 1330.13, Administrative Remedy Program.

Page 17 of 22

If complaining about a sensitive issue, in the sense that the inmate's safety or well-being would be placed in danger if the request became known at the institution, the inmate may submit his administrative remedy directly to the appropriate Regional Director, marking "Sensitive" upon the request and explaining, in writing, the reason for not submitting the request at the institution. See Program Statement 1330.13, Sec.8(d)(1), Administrative Remedy Program. If the Regional Administrative Remedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the request shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to. Otherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will be advised in writing of that determination, without return of the request. The inmate may then pursue the matter by submitting a request for Administrative Remedy locally to the Warden. The Warden shall allow a reasonable extension of time for such a resubmission. See 28 C.F.R. §542.17.

Special procedures regarding the appeal of Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO) actions may be found at 28 C.F.R. §542.14(d)(2). Appeals from DHO actions shall be submitted initially to the Regional Director for the region where the inmate is currently located.

## G. Inmate Designations

The majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates who, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another institution. However, an inmate is not transported to a new institution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court must first provide to the USMS the final presentence investigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order. The USMS must then forward these documents along with a request for designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation Center (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating an institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau considers many factors, including but not limited to, the security level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and judicial recommendations. Once an institution has been designated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or airlift on which space is available. This entire process often takes several weeks to complete. Contact information for DSCC is as follows:

Designation and Sentence Computation Center
Grand Prairie Office Complex
U.S. Armed Forces Reserve Complex
346 Marine Forces Drive
Grand Prairie, TX 75051
Phone: 972-352-4400
Fax: 972-352-4395

Page 18 of 22

Page 19 of 22

# Court Ordered Studies

At anytime during an inmate's pre-trial confinement, the judge may order one of numerous studies found at 18 U.S.C. §4241 et seq. Once a judge signs the request for designation, the court must send a copy to the USMS and Probation who will then contact DSCC. Since the inmate is not sentenced, he is not yet in Bureau custody, therefore the Bureau cannot make the designation without an official request from the USMS to the Bureau in Grand Prairie. Neither the Legal Department nor any institution staff have a role in the process. It is up to the attorneys on the criminal case to make sure the order is processed as described in this paragraph. If questions arise, the attorneys may contact the DSCC (contact info. above).

## H. Health Services

### 1. Sick Call

Inmates are advised during their initial screening and physical examination that if they wish to be evaluated by the Health Services Department, they must submit a sick call slip to the department. It is imperative that inmate's use this system, as it helps the department track requests and have inmates seen on a first need to be seen basis. If an inmate has a verified chronic condition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed in a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments automatically.

Sick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a sick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The sick call box on each housing unit will be emptied daily by a member of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff for triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with greatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.00 co-pay fee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.

### 2. Emergency Care

Any time there is a medical emergency on a unit, the inmate should notify the unit officer who can call the on-duty P.A.

### 3. Medication

With regards to medication, MCC New York staff will make every effort to continue an inmate on a specific medication as long as the inmate has proof that he is on that medication (a prescription, a prescription bottle, etc.). However, for safety of staff and other inmates, there are several medications that an inmate may be on that are not on the national Bureau of Prisons formulary. In this instance, if medical staff find it necessary to prescribe a substitute medication, they will do so. If an inmate is prescribed a medication that has refills, it is their responsibility to notify the pharmacy when they need a refill.

This can be accomplished by placing the empty bottle on the daily pill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least once a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not be in possession of certain medications they need (certain psychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the medication by pharmacy during daily pill line.

## 4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)

If an attorney seeks a court order for an IME, the following information must be included:

1. Inmate’s name and register number;
2. A court order or similar court signed document for the examination;
3. A provision for time and date to be determined by all affected parties;
4. Expected length of examination;
5. Name, title, and organization of each person attending (all-non attorneys and non-legal representatives will have to fill out an application so MCC can complete a background check (See Attachment B);
6. List of all equipment to be used; and
7. An indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been obtained.

All of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will make arrangements with the medical department for a convenient time and date. The physician entering will be subject to using the equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also have to complete Attachment B.

## 5. Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital

All USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will be referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.

## I. Special Housing Unit (SHU)

MCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general population. The SHU consists of two categories of cells: administrative detention and disciplinary segregation.

**Disciplinary Segregation Status.** A form of separation from the general population in which inmates who commit serious violations of Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer, for specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general population. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary segregation upon determining that no other available disposition will adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence necessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable limits.

Page 20 of 22

Administrative Detention Status. A non-punitive form of separation from the general population used when the continued presence of the inmate within the general population would pose a serious threat to life, property, self, staff or other inmates, or to the security or orderly running of the institution. This housing status may also include inmates who require protective custody, those who cannot be placed in local population because they are en route to another institution (holdovers), and those who are awaiting a hearing before the Unit Discipline Committee or Discipline Hearing Officer. Program Statement 5270.07, Inmate Discipline and Special Housing Units, found at Bureau's public website.

Additionally, all newly arriving inmates at MCC are placed in the Special Housing Unit until they are screened and an appropriate housing unit (general population or SHU) is determined.

## J. Miscellaneous

### 1. Religious Programs

Title 28 C.F.R. §548, Religious Programs and Program Statement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices set forth the Bureau of Prisons' policy for inmates who wish to practice their religion while incarcerated. Chaplains are available at all institutions. See 28 C.F.R. §548.12. In addition, contract religious clergy and volunteers from the community augment Bureau staff to make available a wide variety of programs, including those involving group worship, individual religions counseling, spiritual guidance, and the study of sacred writings. See 28 C.F.R. §548.14. Inmates must make all religious requests, including common fare diets, through the Religious Services Department.

### 2. Food Service

Title 28 C.F.R. §548, Subpart C - Special Food and Meals, provides that special diets are available to meet the medical needs of diabetics and others who require low-salt, low-calorie, or other special diets. Additionally, "common-fare" meals are offered to inmates whose religious practices require dietary restrictions. See 28 C.F.R. §§547.20(b) and 548.20; Program Statement 5360.09, Religious Beliefs and Practices. The common fare program is designed to meet the dietary requirements of different religions.

### 3. Inmate Commissary

Inmates' families and friends may send inmates funds through Western Union's Quick Collect Program or through the National Lock Box. Please see instructions at the following address:

http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/money.jsp

Page 21 of 22

Page 22 of 22

4. Marriage

Inmates who seek authorization to marry while in confinement must submit a written request through their Case Manager.

5. Personal Property

Bureau of Prisons policy on inmate retention of personal property is found in Program Statement 5580.07, Personal Property, Inmate. See also 28 C.F.R. Part 553 - Inmate Property. Inmates may possess only that property which by policy is authorized. See 28 C.F.R. §553.11. Those rules contribute to the management of inmate personal property in the institution, and contribute to a safe environment for staff and inmates by reducing fire hazards, security risk, and sanitation problems. Personal hygiene items are issued by the institution for indigent inmates. Inmates may also purchase personal property items from the institution commissary.

Inmates going out to court may bring legal material relevant to their current court proceedings. Inmates are not allowed to return from court with additional legal materials. Attorneys wishing to provide inmates with additional legal materials must send such material in the mail or deposit them material in the lobby legal mail drop boxes.

6. A&amp;O Handbook

Inmates entering MCC New York are provided with an Admission and Orientation ("A&amp;O") Handbook, which explains institution rules and procedures. The A&amp;O Handbook addresses subjects such as purchasing items from the commissary, inmate correspondence and the inmate administrative remedy process.

Hi All,

[left] asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. I explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release the funds?

Thanks,

Dear Mr. Epstein,

▲ SCIENTIST OF THE YEAR: Dr. S. Allen Counter, (1) director of the Harvard Foundation of Harvard University, and Dr. Benedict H. Gross (r), dean of Harvard College and Leverett Professor of Mathematics, present the Harvard Foundation "2004 Scientist of the Year Award" to noted mathematician Professor Dr. Jonathan David Farley. Farley is currently a visiting professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College with straight A's in mathematics and later earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Oxford University. "Jonathan Farley is one of the world's most impressive young mathematicians," said Dr. Counter. "He is a model of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African Americans who may see their intellectual potential in him. Harvard is proud to

honor his achievements and acknowledge his fine example."

# I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which will show the world your support for women.

Alternatively [b)(6)(7)(C)] gave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math professors. You can give me a similar award. [b)(6), (b)(7)(C)] of Oxford, former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pólya Prize-winner [b)(6), (b)(7)(C)] which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publicly stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publicly defending you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Attachments: TEXT.htm, Mime.822

Good morning Mr. [Info]
[To(7)(C)]

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [Info, (b)(7)(C)] and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [Info, (b)(7)(C)] told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [Info, (b)(7)(C)] or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9 south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

[Info, (b)(7)(C)]

# UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
## SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Government.
-against-
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
Defendant.

| --- |
|  DOCUMENT  |
|  ELECTRONICALLY FILED  |

|  DATE FILED: 8/21/19  |

**ORDER**
19 Cr 490

The Court will conduct a brief hearing on Tuesday, August 27, 2019 at 10:30 a.m. in connection with the *nolle prosequi* order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019 by the United States Attorney.

The Court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before any judgment has been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment.

At the hearing, Counsel for the Government and for the deceased Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, will be heard. Counsel for the victims and the victims will also be heard, if they wish to be.

The hearing will be held in Courtroom 17B.

Dear Mr. Epstein,

You called me circa August 2017 and you and I had a Skype call with my Ph.D. student, (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), in December 2017.

▲ SCIENTIST OF THE YEAR: Dr. S. Allen Counter, (l) director of the Harvard Foundation of Harvard University, and Dr. Benedict H. Gross (r), dean of Harvard College and Leverett Professor of Mathematics, present the Harvard Foundation "2004 Scientist of the Year Award" to noted mathematician Professor Dr. Jonathan David Farley. Farley is currently a visiting professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College with straight A's in mathematics and later earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Oxford University. *Jonathan Farley is one of the

world's most impressive young mathematicians," said Dr. Counter. "He is a model of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African Americans who may see their intellectual potential in him. Harvard is proud to honor his achievements and acknowledge his fine example."

# I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which will show the world your support for women.

Alternatively, [b)(6), (b)(7)(C)] gave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math professors. You can give me a similar award. [b)(6), (b)(7)(C)] of Oxford, former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pólya Prize-winner [b)(6), (b)(7)(C)] which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publicly stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000!

https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollege/mathematics-fellowship

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publicly defending you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Cordially,

(University of Oxford), A.B. summa cum laude (Harvard University)

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:

1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr. [fz(6); (bz(7)(C) ]

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [fz(6); (bz(7)(C)]] and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [fz(6)] told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [fz(6); (bz(7)(C)] or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with

Page 3274

his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi All,

[To] [Date] asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. I explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, I told defense counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me they would get back to me. I haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release the funds?

Good morning

I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena, I will have the USAO's Civil Division authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) and the associated regulations.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Good morning Mr. (b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

Page 3520

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (/6318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [69](6)(7)(C) and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [69](6)(7) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [69](6)(7) or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9 south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

[69](6)(7)(C)

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Hello,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media.

We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation?

Thank you,

Good morning Mr. [hn(n), dn(7)(C)]

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with [hn(n), dn(7)(C)] and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [hn(n), dn(7)(C)] told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [hn(n), dn(7)(C)] or Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr.

Page 3991

Page 3992

Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sincerely,

Obviously numerous Epstein articles. This is a sampling.

Star Tribune: "Epstein's guards worked extreme OT shifts morning of death" Guards on Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated Press. http://www.startribune.com/epstein-dies-in-the-dark-but-abuse-investigation-carries-on/533900392/

WaPo: "Corrections officers did not check on Epstein for 'several hours' before his death, violating protocol, person familiar with case says," Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett, August 11, 2019, 11:13 PM Corrections officers had not checked in on financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for "several" hours before he was found hanging in his cell Saturday, a person familiar with the matter said, just one in a series of missteps in the hours leading up to his death.

AP: "Debbie Wasserman Schultz demands Epstein investigation," Jerry Dunleavy, August 11, 2019, 7:44 PM Democratic Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz described as "obscenely inadequate" the Saturday announcement from Attorney General William Barr that Inspector General Michael Horowitz would be investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

NYT: “Before Jail Suicide, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left Alone and Not Closely Monitored,” Katie Benner, August 11, 2019, 11:00 AM

Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who hanged himself in a federal jail in Manhattan, was supposed to have been checked by guards every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not being followed the night before he was found, a law-enforcement official with knowledge of his detention said. In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's normal procedure, two officials said.

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MEMORANDUM

Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York

DATE: April 15, 2019

TO: Lamine N'Diave, Warden, MCC New York
(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)

FROM: b)(6), (b)(7)(C) Chief Psychologist, MCC New York

THRU: Shirley Skipper Scott, Associate Warden, Programs, MCC New York

SUBJECT: RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION

The original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submitted on July 20, 2005 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined below have been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmitted as revisions have been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.

1. **PURPOSE**: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), New York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.

2. **DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

3. **PROCEDURES**: The following are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:

A. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an inmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an inmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological Observation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff (i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food Service Administrator, and Duty Officer.

B. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not feasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The inmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a

staff member.

C. An inmate on Psychological Observation status is allowed only items indicated by a Psychologist. These items will be indicated on the inmate’s psychological observation log book. The suicide watch mattress and suicide watch blanket will be used for all inmates on psychological observation.

D. Log entries as to the behavior of the observed inmate will ideally be made every 15 minutes in a marble log book by the Inmate Companion or staff member, but observation of the inmate is continuous.

E. When the observation is conducted in the suicide watch room, the Unit 2 Officer will make hourly rounds and sign the log book.

F. A Lieutenant and Physician Assistant will also make rounds once a shift and sign the log book.

G. On a daily basis a Psychologist will assess the inmate on Psychological Observation and sign the log book.

H. If there is a staff watch being conducted on 9S, the staff member cannot watch more than two inmates on psychological observation at a time. If the Staff member is watching two inmates on psychological observation, they must be directly next to one another so that the officer can directly observe both of them on a continuous basis.

Captain
Health Services Administrator

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be pres of-state.

We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to

hi Lee,

hope you are well. We saw an article tonight on something called Radaronline reporting that Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit suicide at the MCC (unsuccessfully.)

Are you in a position to help me on that with some sort of confirmation or information. (Or to dispel its veracity?) thanks.

Inmate Epstein (76318-054) has been added on Sentry as a religious diet participant.

Chaplain,

Friendly reminder... Cook Foreman will ensure the diets are provided. Please send him a confirmation email at the earliest convenience with the name and register number of the inmate/s.

Thank you. The first thing is that Inmate Epstein incorrectly wrote his req. # on his request for the religious diet, so Sentry didn't recognize the number. Just before Chaplain as leaving yesterday, we realized the inmate had transposed two of his numbers, and I told him I'd take care of putting him on the religious diet designation. FS s aware of the inmate's dietary needs and has been providing the religious diet since last Friday I've been told.

I also have another religious diet interview scheduled, which will require data entry.

Thanks again,

Reaching out in response to reports that Jeffrey Epstein, being held at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, was found injured in his cell after a possible suicide attempt, allegedly semi-conscious with marks on his neck.

Can you provide a statement in response to these reports and clarify what happened? Is there a possibility that Epstein will be transferred to another facility?

Feel free to give us a call at 718-861- (8618)

Thank you.

Best,

The above inmate said he had his CPAP machine with him at the time of his arrest. He needs to have his CPAP machine for his medical condition. Is it in R and D or can we find out who has his CPAP machine?

Good morning
[8:00] [6:07:00]

I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena, I will have the USAO's Civil Division authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) and the associated regulations.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Thank you,

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.

We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address this issue so (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) to discuss, if that's helpful, or (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) can also be reached directly at (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).

thanks very much,

Do you mind calling attorney conference in the morning and reminding them to hold room 3 open for 10:00 AM? (fri)(h) (fri)(C) and Epstein will likely have an attorney visit, but we need room 3 open for this hearing. If they have to keep Room 3 closed from 8:00 to 10:00 to ensure it is available, then that's what we have to do. (fri)(h) this is an federal civil case out of SDNY so we should accommodate.)

Sounds good. I’ll let the Court know about your facility placing the call to chambers. The number for the Judge is (914) 390- [b)(6). If that changes, I’ll let you know.

Thanks for again your assistance with this.

Hi [b)(6); [b)(7)(C]

It is easier for us to initiate the call here at MCC. [b)(6); [b)(7)(C] will be on a phone that does not allow incoming calls, so we prefer to call the court (or you) at the designated time and transfer the call down to him. Please let us know if that is an issue. Assuming there’s no problem with that, please let us know the appropriate number to call at 11:00 AM on August 9.

Also, so you’re aware, we make every effort to facilitate telephonic court appearances, but there may be emergency circumstances that interfere. If we learn that we will not be able to facilitate the call for some reason, we will let you know as soon as possible.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Thank you,

Good afternoon.

In follow up to my voice mail message earlier today, we understand that inmate (b)(6) (b)(7)(C) is still housed in your facility.

Attached is Judge Smith’s letter order/endorsement scheduling a status conference in this matter for August 9, 2019 at 11:00 a.m.

It is my understanding that Judge Smith’s Chambers will be initiating the call. (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) should be made available to attend this status conference call.

Please let me know if you need any other information in order to have (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) available for this telephone conference.

Thank you.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054

United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Hi Darrin
Hi Darrin

At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the government and defense counsel a chance to speak.

Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan) concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel obviously didn't know that Adam &amp; I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go to SHU.)

Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.

The government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement. They also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC with the judge presiding over their case.

Then we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. I won't rehash the statements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at the government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court oversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's co-conspirators to be charged &amp; brought to justice.

At the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and ended it. I expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the investigation at a later date, probably in a written opinion.

Anyway, I wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. I'm also cc-ing Warden Petrucci on this; I verbally updated him, but he may need to forward this summary to someone higher up the food chain than me.

Thanks,

Dear Judge Berman:

I am writing in regards to your August 12, 2019 inquiry whether the investigations referenced in my August 10, 2019 letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019.

I can confirm that, although an internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23, 2019 incident, the current investigations by the FBI and OIG will include this incident as well. Accordingly, I cannot divulge any information about the prior investigation at this time.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Judge Berman:

I am writing in regards to your August 12, 2019 inquiry whether the investigations referenced in my August 10, 2019 letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019.

I can confirm that, although an internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23, 2019 incident, the current investigations by the FBI and OIG will include this incident as well. Accordingly, I cannot divulge any information about the prior investigation at this time.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054

United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Good morning Christine,

I apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and I could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.

Thank you for your help, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday (re: 8/8), 8/21 and Tuesday.

Best,

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054

United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

Dear Warden N'Diaye,

Thank you for your letter of August 10, 2019 regarding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Epstein’s death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case.

One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019. To my knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded about that incident.

Sincerely,
Richard M. Berman

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting information on Epstein via their personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts.

New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

I hope this finds you well. My name is (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556- (b)(6).

Thanks,

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.

We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address this issue so (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) can meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at (b)(6); (b)(7)(C), to discuss, if that's helpful, or (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) can also be reached directly at (b)(6); (b)(7)(C) if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).

thanks very much,

Here is the approved response:

For privacy and safety and security reasons, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) does not release information on an individual inmate's conditions of confinement. However, we can share that Jeffrey Edward Epstein is currently located at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054

United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836-7700. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Hello,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media.

We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation?

Thank you,

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the parameters involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media.

We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation?

Thank you,
Jane

Wow, right as I finished my last email, my boss just gave me the final response that I'll now send to all the reporters who reached out to our public affairs office in Central Office (you can send this to media who contacted you too [b)(6), (b)(7)(C).]

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.

This is a heads up that our public affairs office, IPPA leadership, and the Director's office drafted a statement for all Epstein inquiries today that DOJ's public affairs folks are now reviewing. USMS will also see it because they are getting media inquiries and called me. And DOJ's Legislative Affairs team as well as BOP's legislative affairs folks are getting Congressional interest (Members' offices saying we should take better care of him, etc.).

The final response to media that will be approved by DOJ should be given to me within the hour and I will send it out to more than 30 reporters who've emailed me. I'll give the response to b)(6), who can give it to media who've contacted him in Lee's absence (Lee also has been in touch with me to be sure I have all I need).

I'll send you all the final approved response from DOJ when I get it.

Does 12 noon work? If there is something new and pressing, we can do a call earlier.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland says three people have pleaded guilty in connection with a scheme to smuggle contraband into a state prison.

## Tucker Carlson and John Kennedy get the First Step Act all wrong

Washington Examiner

When President Trump signed the First Step Act into law in December 2018, he was flanked by conservative senators and law enforcement officials. They were on hand to see him enact a carefully cultivated collection of criminal justice reforms, emulating on the federal level smart policy changes already successfully passed in red states such as Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina.

Kardashian discussed prison reform with a group of incarcerated men and women, the department said. She also spoke about the Georgetown Prison Scholars Program, a higher education initiative at the jail.

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against
[09(0), (09(7)(C)]
've spoken to an AFGE union official and
[09(0), (09(7)(C)]
defense attorney. The
story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.

Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?
Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?
Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?
Is it correct that Noel and Thomas were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?
What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.)
Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges?
What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

Thank you,

I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts.

I hope this finds you well. My name is (b) (6), (b) (7) (C) and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556- (b) (6).

I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena, I will have the USAO's Civil Division authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) and the associated regulations.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Hugh,

1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA.
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding more information.

(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP's response to the union's contention is staffing shortages at the root of the problem?

[0g8j; @g7gC)

- that some cells in the facility are covered in mold
- that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for prisoners to take showers at a reasonable temperature
- that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They "be lucky if they were treated like dirt under somebody else's shoe, but they're not even treated that well," said one lawyer
- that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility ("whether its people who are suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need spiritual guidance or religious accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get warehoused there - all of that is lacking.")
- that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women's floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to clean up the feces themselves
