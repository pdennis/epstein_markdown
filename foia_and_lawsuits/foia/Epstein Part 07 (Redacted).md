## Narrative

On 11/24/05 at about 21:49 hours I went to [redacted] in reference to a suspicious person. I met with [redacted] who stated she has two juvenile daughters. Tonight she noticed they went across the street to a vacant house with some boys. When she went to check on them she caught the boys drinking alcohol. She knew the boys were juveniles so she took the alcohol (tequila) from them she said a couple of the boys ran off. Juvenile one got in his silver Mitsubishi and went to the end of the street. He then stopped infront of her house. The juvenile stated he wanted his tequila back and he would come back at midnight.

Mrs. [redacted] is concerned juvenile one might return and damage her guests vehicles. Mrs. [redacted] asked her juveniles who the subject was and they were unfamiliar. I gave Mrs. [redacted] a case card. I returned into service with no further incident. I informed morning watch of this address for an extra patrol for tonight only.

# Narrative

While on patrol, I was dispatched to a missing person call a [redacted] arrived and made contact with the caller/mother of the missing juvenile female, [redacted]. She stated her juvenile daughter left yesterday for school, and had not returned. [redacted] told me she had spoken with her daughter around 1900 and she was going to the high school basketball game. Later on that night, some of the juveniles's friends called the mother and informed her they had not seen the juvenile at the game.

When the juvenile didn't return this morning, [redacted] said she became worried and started to contact some of her daughter's friends. They told her they heard she was handing hanging around with Mr. Byron Elrod in an area known as "The Cut" which is located off Old Donaldson and Highway 140. "The Cut" is a known drug area in the county. I completed a missing person's checklist and obtained a recent picture of the juvenile. I called Detective Allen and informed her of the situation. The mother did not want a juvenile complaint filed. I issued [redacted] a case card and asked her to call if she found any more information regarding her daughter. D/S Ballard and I left the residence and returned to service.

After patrolling Old Donaldson Rd and the Crissler Street area, we were unable to locate any additional information as to the whereabouts of the female. Around 1200, I received a telephone call from [redacted] stating that she had found her daughter, and she was located at Gregory Lane Apartments off Bells Ferry Rd. The mother told me a friend of the family was going to pick the female up, and escort her back to the parents house. I told [redacted] to call 911 when her daughter returned and a deputy would be sent out to check on the well being of the juvenile.

When the juvenile returned Sgt Thompson met with the juvenile and parents at the house. The Juvenile stated she had been drinking and had done some drugs last night, and that she had been scared to call her parents. She then went to a friends house located at Gregory Lane Apartments and spent the night.

## Narrative

On 012106 I was notified by dispatch to give B-43 a call. I called and spoke with D/S Ballard and he was taking a report of a missing juvenile age 15. He stated she was supposed to have went to a basketball game last night but she didn't. He stated she went off with some black males. He told they were stopped by some white friends of her and they fought with the black males. D/S Ballard said the mother had contact with her daughter around 8:00 last night but had not heard from her since then.

NARRATIVE #3
Reported By: PARKINSON, GREGORY A. 10/08/03
Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 10/08/03

At 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a burglary had been reported at 358 El Brillo. I responded to the scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process the crime scene.

I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way leading to a three car garage.

The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been
touched or tampered with.

On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass
windows present. The eastern most and western most are
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central
window.

Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a
supplement to that effect that will follow.

Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 10/09/03

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video
footage of the suspect burglar.

Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a
property receipt.

At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed
several video cameras on the outside of the building and
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the
building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach
identification card application.

At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and
spoke with the manager of the condominium who
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement.
Dement gave me his direct business number
561-833-8170, and his home phone number
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.

Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he
advised that he would check and call me back in the
morning.

Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 10/15/03

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into the police department and informed me that earlier today he met with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun because he was contemplating suicide.

Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi said he does not have it.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

Mrs. Alessi stated she does not know her husband's current address and provided us with a cell phone for him. While speaking to Mrs. Alessi, Det. Dawson made telephone contact with Juan Alessi and made arrangements to meet with him back at the Palm Beach Police Department. According to Mrs. Alessi, the last time she saw her husband Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, was today, 10/13/03. According to Mrs. Alessi, she was at Ross Department Store located on Okeechobee Blvd. when she saw her husband drive by.

at which time she did not talk to him per instructions by her divorce attorney. Mrs. Alessi stated prior to that she last saw her husband on 10/08/03, in which she responded to the apartment building, 1515 South Flager Drive, at approximately 2:00 a.m. Mrs. Alessi stated she contacted West Palm Beach Police Department via 911, and officer's responded. I contacted the West Palm Beach Police Department which queried their CAD system and confirmed Officer Sean Phillips responded to that address in reference to a 911 phone call. There is no report on file and list said CAD entry only that Juan P. Alessi was in the building reference to a civil matter. They have no current information for Mr. Alessi. This concludes my involvement in the matter.

On 10/13/03, Det. Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us.

Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been separated for approximately two months and they are going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no longer lives with her at this address and she has a court order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross Department Store located on the southeast corner of Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she comes in contact with him to call the police immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645.

I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in which he stated he understood and signed.

I asked Juan what his connection was with Mr. Epstein,

he lives at 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr. Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan did not know the exact date, but he said it was approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the house through an unlocked sliding glass door located near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then went into Epstein's briefcase and removed approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he immediately left the house.

Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 El Brillo in order to steal money once again from Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan entered the house through the sliding glass door and entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said he left through the same glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers.

I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the money that was taken.

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag
U72UGL.

On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time.
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had
denied taking the Glock hand gun.

In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun.

On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with
mailing the original back to me for my case file.

At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.

Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S.
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

On Sunday 10/5/03 at approximately 0824 hours, I was dispatched to a burglary at 358 El Brillo Way. Upon arrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white male, dob/012053. Epstein advised he and his personal assistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/052579, arrived in the residence on Friday evening, 10/3/03. Epstein advised that on Saturday evening 10/4/03, he left his briefcase at his desk and went to bed at approximately 1230 am. Epstein said when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately $5000 U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $100 bills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase. Epstein stated at approximately 0715 hours on Sunday, 10/5/03, while sitting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had been opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein believed approximately $3500 was taken from the briefcase. Epstein advised that he did not know if the cash was sequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a black Glock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind his desk. Epstein advised he suspected cash had been taken from his briefcase on two other occasions while he was in town for the weekend. The first was over Labor Day weekend Aug. 30-Sept 1, 2003. The second time was a weekend in mid September, 2003. Epstein stated he did not

report these incidents because he was not sure the money was accounted for. Possible footage of the incident may exist. I next met with Kellen who advised she went to bed at approximately 1130 pm on 10/4/03 and did not hear or see anything unusual through the night or on the morning of 10/5/03. Cotrin, the resident chef advised that he went to bed at approximately 1030 pm on 10/4/03 and began work at approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03. Cotrin stated that he did not see or hear anything unusual from the staff residence locate don the east side of the property. I next spoke to Mike and Rosalie Friedman who are the house managers. Mike stated that he went to the staff residence at approximately 8:30 hours on 10/4/03 and got up at approximately 11:30 pm same night to move the Mercedes into the garage. Mike said he returned to the residence at approximately 6:20 am on 10/5/03 but did not notice anything unusual. Rosalie stated that she checked the exterior of the residence at approximately 7:30pm on 10/4/03 as part of her duties. Rosalie stated at that time, she saw no one and everything appeared in order. Rosalie stated she left the main house at approximately 11:30 pm and returned at approximately 8:30 on 10/5/03. It should be noted that Mike and Rosalie Friedman have been employed as the house managers since 9/24/03. Prior to them, the live on site house managers were Patrick and Evelyn, Epstein was unsure of the last name. Patrick Evelyn were employed at 358 El Brillo approximately 9 months. Prior to the house manager was John Alessi who was employee at 358 El Brillo approximately 10 years. Epstein signed an affidavit of prosecution, it is attached to this report. Crime Scene manager Parkinson responded and processed the scene. Det. Melnichok also responded. See Det. Melnichok's report for further information. Officer Nault responded and conducted a neighborhood canvas which is also attached to this report. It should be noted that Epstein will contact Palm Beach Police Department with the serial number of the stolen handgun so that it may be entered into FCIC.

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53.

Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the suspect.

Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt, and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, living at 1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida.

I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. Epstein told me he would call when he had more information.

Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side of the house but not the west side of the house because he had personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee Blvd. to obtain the information.

Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.

At 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a burglary had been reported at 358 El Brillo. I responded to the scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process the crime scene.

I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way leading to a three car garage.

The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been
touched or tampered with.

On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass
windows present. The eastern most and western most are
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central
window.

Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a
supplement to that effect that will follow.

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video
footage of the suspect burglar.

Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a
property receipt.

At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed
several video cameras on the outside of the building and
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the
building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager
Greg Parkinson that he had located fingerprints for the
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach
identification card application.

At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and
spoke with the manager of the condominium who
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement.
Dement gave me his direct business number
561-833-8170, and his home phone number
561-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.

Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he
advised that he would check and call me back in the
morning.

On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into the police department and informed me that earlier today he met with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun because he was contemplating suicide.

Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi said he does not have it.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **

Marie said Juan no longer lives with her at this address and she has a court order which states Juan is to have no contact with her. Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours, Juan drove by her as she was walking out of the Ross Department Store located on the southeast corner of Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan waved at her and that was the extent of their contact. Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she comes in contact with him to call the police immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645.

I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview. Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in which he stated he understood and signed.

I asked Juan what his connection was with Mr. Epstein,

he lives at 358 El Brillo. Juan said he worked for Mr. Epstein from January 1991 to until September 2002, as the house manager. Juan said he was very familiar with Epstein's schedule and the lay out of the house. I asked Juan if he took money and a gun from Epstein in the past weeks and Juan said he did not take the gun but did take money from Epstein's house. Juan explained approximately six weeks ago he became very depressed about his break up with his wife along with a cancerous medical condition he was fighting. Juan advised he became suicidal and decided to steal a gun from Mr. Epstein in order to kill himself. Juan said he knew Mr. Epstein had a gun in his office because he helped Mr. Epstein put it there. Juan described the gun as a silver revolver with a medium barrel that was holstered. Juan did not know the exact date, but he said it was approximately six weeks ago at about 0500 hours on a Sunday morning, he decided to enter Mr. Epstein's house at 358 El Brillo Avenue, in an attempt to steal the gun. Juan said he drove his white Caravan and parked it in the driveway of the house. Juan said he entered the house through an unlocked sliding glass door located near Epstein's office. Juan said he entered the office and attempted to locate the gun. Juan said he searched the office but could not find the gun. Juan said he then went into Epstein's briefcase and removed approximately $1900. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said after taking the money he immediately left the house.

Juan said on Sunday morning, 10/05/03, at approximately 0500 hours, he decided to return to 358 El Brillo in order to steal money once again from Epstein. Juan said he once again drove his white Caravan to the house and parked in the driveway. Juan entered the house through the sliding glass door and entered the office. Juan said he opened the briefcase and removed $5600. in one hundred dollar bills from a white envelope. Juan said he left through the same glass door and drove away. Juan said he believed he wore a creme colored loafers, light colored pants, a short sleeve shirt, and a baseball hat. Juan said he did not wear gloves on his hands. Juan said he needed the money to pay for his girlfriends immigration papers.

I asked Juan if he was still suicidal. Juan said he was not and that he was seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis. (this was verified by Juan's son, John Alessi) Juan once again denied taking a gun from Epstein's house. Juan said he had a talk with Mr. Epstein on 10/12/03, and they agreed Juan would pay Epstein back for all the money that was taken.

Reported By: MELNICHOK, THOMAS C. 11/12/03
Entered By: GREENE, LINDA C. 11/12/03

On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag
U72UGL.

On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time.
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had
denied taking the Glock hand gun.

In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun.

On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with
mailing the original back to me for my case file.

At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.

Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S.
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.

Epstein wanted to be rubbed on his back and recently he began turning over and have her rub his chest as he masturbated. He would try to touch her breasts as she rubbed his chest. Stated “Jeff would try to get away with more and more on each massage”. Stated Epstein would try to touch her more and on one occasion he attempted to use a massager/vibrator on her. Robson drove to the house for the original massage. I left Sarah her cell phone number and every time Epstein would come into town, Sarah would call her for an appointment to “work”. Each time she went, Sarah would meet her at the kitchen door area. She would bring her upstairs and prepare the massage table. Advised Epstein would ask her questions about herself. Epstein knew she was a soccer player and would be attending. I asked if Epstein knew her real age. Stated Epstein did and didn’t care. The most recent massage she provided was on October 1, 2005. During the massage, she asked Epstein if she could borrow one of his vehicles to visit her family and boyfriend in Orlando, Florida. Epstein had told her she could borrow one of his vehicles but later stated he would rent her a car. She continued with the massage as Epstein grabbed her buttocks and caressed the buttocks cheeks. I asked she was wearing undergarments to which she replied her thong underwear. Once he tried to touch her breasts, she would pull away from him and he would stop. I was asked if he ever used a vibrator on her. I was aware of the vibrator but advised she never would allow him to use the vibrator on her. She described the vibrator as the large white vibrator with a huge head on the tip of the vibrator. She stated he kept the vibrator in a closet near the massage table.

I stated that on October 3, 2005, she was contacted by Epstein’s assistant, Sarah, who informed her that Jeff Epstein had rented her a new Nissan Sentra and she should come by the house to pick it up. Sarah informed she would have the car for a month. I stated Epstein knew her car was not working properly and that she had missed appointments in the past because of her car being inoperable. I explained the car is currently parked next to the Gym field. I asked her if she ever took any one to the house. I explained she took a friend of hers who attended, who has relocated to Orlando to attend college. I asked if she ever allowed another female in the room. I advised no one was brought into the room with her.

At the conclusion of the interview, Det Dawson and I went to the gym area of and located the Silver Nissan Sentra bearing Florida tag X98-APM. The vehicle is registered to Dollar Rent a Car out of the Palm Beach International Airport. The vehicle was rented by Janusz Banasiack, later learned to be Epstein’s houseman, and paid with Epstein’s credit card.

On September 11, 2005, w/f dob, was arrested by the Palm Beach Police Department

[redacted] explained she remembered the steam room area, which contained two large showers. Epstein entered the room from the steam room area and introduced himself. Epstein lay on the table and told her to get comfortable. [redacted] removed her skirt and kept her shirt on. Epstein then instructed her to remove her shirt.

Center from Cingular Wireless for telephone number 561-308-0282. This was the telephone number for Haley Robson during the time frame when the victim, was brought to the Epstein house to "work." An analysis of the phone records, of all incoming and outgoing calls, showed that on February 6, 2005, the day the victim, was brought to the house, Robson first called Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, at 917-855-3363 at 12:50 pm (EST). The next call was made to Epstein's house in Palm Beach, at 12:52 pm (EST). The following call was made to the victim, at 1:01 pm (EST) and at 1:02 pm (EST). This confirms the information provided by the victim and victim's father. I photo copied the records and enlarged the page 8 of 10 to show the calls made by Robson on February 6, 2005.

To this date, I have not heard from parents. I will attempt to establish contact with them during the evening hours. I received a package from Atty. Guy Fronstin, which was hand delivered at the police station. Within the package, was a letter from Alan Dershowitz, and two www.myspace.com profiles. The profiles were that of and MySpace.com is a social networking service that allows members to create unique personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new friends. This package was in response to a previous meeting in which Mr. Dershowitz called to assist in the investigation in providing any additional witnesses such as house employees who have been reluctant to speak with law enforcement.

I reviewed the profiles Mr. Dershowitz enclosed. who designed her blog to be " still attends " sends and receives messages from friends which contain some profanity. Upon reviewing her friends' comments section from Myspace, most of her good friends sent messages to establish contact and invite her to go out.

I then reviewed web blog which was provided by Mr. Dershowitz. Ms. designed her blog to be " Her blog states that her interests include music, theater and weed (Marijuana). I reviewed her packet in which declares her love for her live-in boyfriend. She also describes using marijuana with her boyfriend

The letter Mr. Dershowitz sent advised he was looking into the allegation that one of the private investigators used by the private attorneys of Epstein, attempted to impersonate or state that they were police officers from Palm Beach. Mr. Dershowitz advised that the investigators used to interview had "quite a distinct speech impediment", did not claim to be nor did they impersonate themselves as a police officer. This package was sent to both ASA Lana Belohlavic and ASA Daliah Weiss at the State Attorney's Office.

I made telephone contact with ASA Weiss to confirm she received the package and request an interview with Sarah Kellen, Nada Marcinkova, and Janusz Banasiak. She advised she would assist in attempting to
