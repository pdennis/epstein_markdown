Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [date: 09/26] who indicated that

most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. [09/26]

[09/26]

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate

is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, eleases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

Page 12

his case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [698][6979C] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate[698][6979C]

[698][6979C]
His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [bulk: do7xC]

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there:

was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed alone in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's normal procedure, two officials said.

1. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch?
2. How long was he on suicide watch?
3. What unit in the jail was he housed?
4. Was he by himself?
5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?
6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of restricted duty while there is an ongoing investigation?
7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show?
8. What did he use to hang himself?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by (646) (6473C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate (646) (6473C)

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hello,

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation.

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate [name] is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on

Page 226

Page 61

a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate [bok: dq72C] were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, [bok: dq72C] releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate [bok: dq72C]

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Epstein Update

London morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because or more comfortable for him. He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. Thank you.

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [text] who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. [text]

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate [text] as a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate [text] were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, [text] releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate [text]

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [text] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status) or drug

Page 337

Page 121

serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

his case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. [6:17:1A] I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because [6:17:1A] or more comfortable for him. [6:17:1A] He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. Thank you, [6:16, 6:17:1C]

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse [6:16; 6:17:1C] saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse [6:16; 6:17:1C]

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with (646; 847xC) who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. (847xA)

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate (646; 847xC) s a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate (646; 847xC) were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However (646; 847xC) releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate (646; 847xC)

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [b)(6): (b)(7)(C). Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [b)(6): (b)(7)(C)

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [REDACTED] who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. [REDACTED]

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate [REDACTED] is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on

Page 482

Page 181

a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate [b)(6); (b)(7)(C) were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, [b)(6); (b)(7)(C) releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [b)(6); (b)(7)(C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with (646) 89730 who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. (6473A)

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate (646) 89730 is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate (646) 89730 were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, (646) 89730 releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate (646) 89730.

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [b)(6)(b)(7)(C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [b)(6)(b)(7)(C)

[h] [b)(6)(b)(7)(C]
His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [code: 00072C] who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. [0072A]

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate [code: 00072C] is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate [code: 00072C] were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However [code: 00072C] releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate [code: 00072C]

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by (b)(6; d)(7)(C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate (b)(6; d)(7)(C)

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

# PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result, information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

Name: Jeffrey Epstein
Register Number: 76318-054
Date of Death: 08-10-2019
Prepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Psychology Services Branch, Central Office

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills, former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a psychological reconstruction. The team consisted of National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Central Office; Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator, Central Office; Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

**Social History:** Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible. The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953 and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School, a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

1

Page 283

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a consultant with [il(9)il)(il)(7)(C)] in the late 1980s. [il(9)il)(il)(7)(C)] was described as his first mentor. [il(9)il)(il)(7)(C)] was later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi scheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his own personal use. Years later [il(9)il)(il)(7)(C)] Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company, granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as [il(9)il)(il)(7)(C)] mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), (b) (2), 2 on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision &amp; Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held on remand.

## Institutional History

On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22 hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

## HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION

BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia, omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication. However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,” thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were not available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System records in BEMR (PDS-BEMR), Forensic Psychologist at MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening, Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consultation with National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on July 8, 2019 Chief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding. Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

3

Page 285

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with [8081:8072G] She determined that, while suicide watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on July 10, 2019.

[8072A] He was placed on suicide watch by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately 1:40 a.m. pending a formal in-person suicide risk assessment. [8081:8072G] Staff Psychologist at MCC New York, assessed Mr. Epstein for risk of suicide later in the morning of July 23, 2019, and determined he should remain on suicide watch. [8072A]

[8072A]

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes. Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation, where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment, per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

Mr. Epstein attended a court hearing on July 31, 2019, and, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided paperwork to Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D) staff that noted "suicidal tendencies." [8081:8072G] was notified on August 1, 2019, about this paperwork. She consulted with [8081:8072G] and then met with Mr. Epstein to conduct a suicide risk assessment. She determined suicide watch was not warranted at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

Page 286

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit. On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told [SHE: 0017102] the toilet in his cell would not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was unable to sleep that night.

## ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019, Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

|  [S171A]  |   |
| --- | --- |
|  [S171A] | After 31 hours and 5 minutes on Suicide Watch, he was then placed on Psychological Observation. On July 30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from Psychological Observation. [SHE: 0017102] sent an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. This e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members had opened the message.  |

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities. According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein, knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

5

Page 287

did not return from court. The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch (DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the EW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer Specialist SHU staff were informed at approximately 1:50 p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not return from court. Furthermore, Officer noted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon arrival from his attorney visit.

A review of the 30-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW shift on August 10, 2019. However, a memorandum from Lieutenant indicates Officer and Material Handler Supervisor made a statement after Mr. Epstein’s death that they did not complete proper 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.

## DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called for medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at 6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing video footage.

## CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide, were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences, and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

6

Page 288

to cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother. Indeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, power, and association with other high-profile individuals.

In the weeks before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

The following recommendations concern institution operations:

1. Single Ceiling:

2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2019.

In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019, [SURC: (b)X7)(C)] sent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scott, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between [SURC: (b)X7)(C) and [SURC: (b)X7)(C)] National Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [SURC: (b)X7)(C)

7

Page 289

reviewed the consult and recommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another inmate who had also been accused of committing a sex offense. There is no evidence this information was considered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a sexual offense.

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

4. Documentation Accuracy:

It is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective evidence.

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

Although the incident report was later expunged, inmates frequently experience significant stress when they contemplate the potential consequences associated with findings of guilt.

entered a Psychology Services Intake Screening into PDS-BEMR on July 8, 2010. The document has three typographical errors. She selected the No Sexual Offense Convictions check box when, in fact, Mr. Epstein was previously convicted of Solicitation of Prostitution and Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution. Second, Mr. Epstein was erroneously identified as a Black male in this document. Finally, there is one instance where he was mistakenly referred to as

8

Page 290

completed a Risk of Sexual Abusiveness document on July 8, 2019. She marked “History of prior prison sexual predation” in the affirmative. This is not accurate.

Mid-Level Practitioner, completed a History and Physical on July 9, 2019. An Intake Screening should have been conducted within 24 hours of his entry into Bureau custody which was on July 6, 2019, according to P6031.04, Patient Care.

Officer was responsible for observing Mr. Epstein and documenting his behavior while on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. Officer mistakenly used a Suicide Watch Log Book intended for inmate companion documentation between 1:40 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on July 23, 2019, when he should have been using the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. Drug Treatment Specialist, reportedly noticed this error and subsequently hand copied all of Officer entries from 1:40 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. into a Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. She then initialed these entries, and this makes it appear as if she was the one conducting the watch. This information was discovered and conveyed in an e-mail from Ms. Charisma Edge, Associate Warden to with a carbon copy to Warden N’Diaye on August 12, 2019. Of note, did not make an entry explaining why she was making the log book changes. Additionally, then wrote entries for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. in the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. These were not a part of the original entries made by Officer nor was assigned to work the Suicide Watch post. Due to the inability to interview staff at this time, it is unknown why attempted to correct Officer error, or made any of the subsequent log entries. It is recommended that if a staff member makes an entry error (e.g., writes in the incorrect suicide watch log book), the staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.

A review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing on 10 occasions and a medical provider’s signature is missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information on the BP-A0292.

A review of Psychology Observation Log Books revealed significant discrepancies from the approved Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly rounds and sign the log book; 179

9

Page 291

out of 183 round signatures were missing. The lieutenant is required to sign the log book one time per shift and signatures were missing in 10 of 23 instances. A Physician Assistant is required to sign one time per shift and 16 of 16 instances were missing.

5. **Telephone Calls**: In a PDS-BEMR note written by on July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manager on August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family who was the Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call. Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told he was calling his mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

6. **Direct Observation**: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was without “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.

7. **Follow-Up**: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m. institution count that evening, Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-mail she sent to Drs. and and Lieutenant Median later that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as “distraught, sad and a little confused.” She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was

10

Page 292

okay, and he reportedly said he was. However, [808; dcc70C] noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenant [808; dcc70C] opened the e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Additionally, if [808; dcc70C] was concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*, requires her to maintain direct, continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When [808; dcc70C] opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by [808; dcc70C] at approximately 9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this. Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.” Furthermore, P5324.07, *SENTRY Psychology Alert Function* states, “When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.” [805]

Both of these groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided R&amp;D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The USMS requested R&amp;D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m. [808; dcc70C] sent [808; dcc70C] an e-mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Specifically, when a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,

11

Page 293

continuous observation until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by [illegible] for a suicide risk assessment on August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

8. **Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy**: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate [illegible] and Mr. Epstein were all assigned to the same cell. On August 13, 2019, at 12:06 p.m. and 12:08 p.m., a quarters history roster was generated for inmate [illegible] and [illegible] respectively. Inmate [illegible] cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from August 5, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-212UAD. Inmate [illegible] cell assignment was Z04-206UAD from August 1, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history roster was generated for Mr. Epstein on August 13, 2019, at 9:07 a.m. His cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate [illegible] in cell 207L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate [illegible] in cell 212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate Epstein in cell 220L (SENTRY never shows him in this cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-054). The locator shows inmate [illegible] and inmate [illegible] in cell 206. The photo sheets show the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes’ identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to H01-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.

12

Page 294

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death. Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.

11. Post Orders &amp; SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign-In Sheets were reviewed for the 3rd Quarter, spanning June 9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Office [both; doi7502] failed to sign post orders for SHU #3 post.

Quarterly SHU Training Sign-In Sheets were reviewed. The 2019 3rd Quarter SHU Training was conducted on June 6, 2019. Three staff assigned to the 3rd Quarter SHU Roster in SHU did not attend or receive the SHU Training: Officer [both; doi7502] and Officer [both; doi7502].

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing

13

Page 295

the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

13. **Sex Offense Risk Factors**: A broad understanding of risk factors associated with sex offenders, by staff at MCC New York, did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison.

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [b) (b)(7)(C)] who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. [b)(7)(A)

[b)(7)(A) Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate [b)(8)(B)(7)(C)] is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate [b)(8)(B)(7)(C) were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However [b)(8)(B)(7)(C) releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate [b)(8)(B)(7)(C)

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [b)(8)(B)(7)(C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug

Page 716

Page 298

serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hello,

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney. I will provide you with information concerning the medical assessment, once I receive it. Thanks.

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with (01/01, 01/27/20) who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. (01/27/20)

Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate (01/01, 01/27/20) is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate (01/01, 01/27/20) were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, (01/01, 01/27/20) releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate (01/01, 01/27/20)

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by (0.0% 0.07°C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate (0.0% 0.07°C)

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI's investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

Page 307

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at (646)836. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

RE: Epstein update

TEXT.htm, Mime.822

I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named [bot; do75C] phonetic) who claimed to be an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body [bot; do75C] left his phone number as 646-836 [bot; do75C]

Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate.

(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)

Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by 07/24/2019, Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate 07/24/2019

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Good morning all,

Epstein's attorneys are trying to get him his CPAP machine per our request. Can we have them hand-deliver it to medical staff as we have in previous instances?

Mr [8081; (607)C]

Is Mr. Epstein approved to receive a CPAP machine? If so, should we send it directly to him through the inmate mail system? Please confirm.

Thank you.

Hi
[ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ]

I just had a nice chat with [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] from the Florida Sheriff's Office. He was very cooperative and agreed to send us Epstein's PSR and/or any documents that have PSR-like information. He said a lot of the Epstein files were destroyed per their RIDS before Epstein was even arrested here, but he is going to go through whatever documents they have for me. [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] said it would take about a week for him to pull the relevant documents. Once he gathered the documents, he said he would send them to me rather than email them. Apparently Florida has a very open FOIA law and all of his emails are subject to public disclosure (which sounds like a nightmare!). He said he would burn the documents onto a CD and FedEx it to me. [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] I'll be out of the office next week, but he has [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] number. [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] said he would call [ˈeɪtɪkɪ ˈdɪtɪʃzɛ] and give him a heads-up that the mail was forthcoming.

Feel free to give me a ring if you want to discuss further.

This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [link: doc7xG]: Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [link: doc7xG]

[link: doc7xG]

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because

he requested Protective Custody.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (6361; (6373C)) saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse [dcd1; dcd7;cC]

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Good afternoon all,

Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are requesting:

2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.

Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning (b)(6)(d)(7)(C)

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) Lieutenant (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) and (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) where (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) told our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) p (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can (b)(6)(d)(7)(C) or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he's been eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

I met with part of the FDLE investigative team yesterday and turned over to them the start of our investigation.

Below you will find the POC from FDLE and with your permission I'd like to forward your contact information to him if he would need to contact your office.

Dear Commissioner Swearingen:

Today, I received the attached letter from Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. I am requesting that FDLE assume the criminal investigation regarding Jeffrey Epstein.

Also, I am requesting that FDLE initiate a preliminary inquiry into misconduct and allegations that go beyond the reported concerns with Jeffrey Epstein’s work release.

Finally, please find attached my Executive Order reassigning this matter from Palm Beach County to the State Attorney for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit of Florida, Bruce Colton.

Thank you for your prompt attention in this matter.

Dear Governor DeSantis,

"For 48 years, I've dedicated my life to enforcing and upholding the law; as a patrol officer, detective, chief of police and, since 2004, as the Sheriff of Palm Beach County.

My job now, as it has always been, is to not only maintain public safety but also the public's trust.

Given the recent questions that have been raised around the Jeffrey Epstein case, I am formally requesting that FDLE assume the existing criminal investigation and I pledge the cooperation and participation of my agency. I believe the public interest would be best served by an FDLE-led investigation examining every aspect of the Epstein case, from court sentencing to incarceration. My agency will continue with the on-going internal affairs investigation.

As you know, Governor, I'm proud of this Department, and the men and women who devote their lives every day to protecting others. Be rest assured as with any issue or concern that has crossed my desk over the past 15 years, I will strive for the truth, wherever that leads, to ensure justice is served and the public trust in our law enforcement agency is maintained."

Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is plugged in?

I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed?

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

# PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result, information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

Name: Jeffrey Epstein
Register Number: 76318-054
Date of Death: 08-10-2019
Prepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Psychology Services Branch, Central Office

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills, former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a psychological reconstruction. The team consisted of National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Central Office. Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator, Central Office. Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

**Social History:** Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible. The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953 and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School, a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

1

Page 484

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a consultant with [608]: do(7)(C) in the late 1980s. [608]: do(7)(C) was described as his first mentor [608]: do(7)(C) was later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi scheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his own personal use. Years later [608]: do(7)(C) Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company, granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as [608]: do(7)(C) mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), (b) (2), 2 on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision &amp; Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held on remand.

Page 485

## Institutional History

On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22 hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

## HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION

BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia, omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication. However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,” thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were not available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System records in BEMR (PDS-BEMR) [898; 897xC] Forensic Psychologist at MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening, Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consultation with [898; 897xC] National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on July 8, 2019 [898; 897xC] Chief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding. Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

<!-- Chunk 10 of 20 -->

Page 486

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with [8081; 8072G] She determined that, while suicide watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on July 10, 2019.

[8072A] He was placed on suicide watch by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately 1:40 a.m. pending a formal in-person suicide risk assessment. [8081; 8072G] Staff Psychologist at MCC New York, assessed Mr. Epstein for risk of suicide later in the morning of July 23, 2019, and determined he should remain on suicide watch. [8072A]

[8072A]

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes. Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation, where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment, per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

Mr. Epstein attended a court hearing on July 31, 2019, and, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided paperwork to Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D) staff that noted "suicidal tendencies." [8081; 8072G] was notified on August 1, 2019, about this paperwork. She consulted with [8081; 8072G] and then met with Mr. Epstein to conduct a suicide risk assessment. She determined suicide watch was not warranted at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

Page 487

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit. On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told [SME: (b)7)(C)] he toilet in his cell would not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was unable to sleep that night.

## ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019, Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

|  [B)(7)(A) | After 31 hours and 5 minutes on Suicide Watch, he was then placed on Psychological Observation. On July 30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from Psychological Observation [SME: (B)(7)(C)] sent an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. This e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members had opened the message.  |

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities. According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein, knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

Page 488

did not return from court. The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch (DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the EW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer Specialist SHU staff were informed at approximately 1:50 p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not return from court. Furthermore, Officer noted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon arrival from his attorney visit.

A review of the 30-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW shift on August 10, 2019. However, a memorandum from Lieutenant indicates Officer and Material Handler Supervisor made a statement after Mr. Epstein’s death that they did not complete proper 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.

## DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called for medical assistance, activated the , and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at 6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing video footage.

## CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide, were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences, and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

6

Page 489

to cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother. Indeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, power, and association with other high-profile individuals. [B)(7)(A)

In the weeks before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

The following recommendations concern institution operations:

1. Single Celling: [B)(5)

2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2019, [B)(7)(A)  [B)(6); (B)(7)(C)

In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019, [B)(6); (B)(7)(C) sent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scott, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between [B)(6); (B)(7)(C) and [B)(6); (B)(7)(C) National Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [B)(6); (B)(7)(C)

7

Page 490

reviewed the consult and recommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another inmate who had also been accused of committing a sex offense. There is no evidence this information was considered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a sexual offense.

4. Documentation Accuracy:

It is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective evidence.

Although the incident report was later expunged, inmates frequently experience significant stress when they contemplate the potential consequences associated with findings of guilt.

entered a Psychology Services Intake Screening into PDS-BEMR on July 8, 2010. The document has three typographical errors. She selected the No Sexual Offense Convictions check box when, in fact, Mr. Epstein was previously convicted of Solicitation of Prostitution and Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution. Second, Mr. Epstein was erroneously identified as a Black male in this document. Finally, there is one instance where he was mistakenly referred to as .

completed a Risk of Sexual Abusiveness document on July 8, 2019. She marked “History of prior prison sexual predation” in the affirmative. This is not accurate.

Mid-Level Practitioner, completed a History and Physical on July 9, 2019. An Intake Screening should have been conducted within 24 hours of his entry into Bureau custody which was on July 6, 2019, according to P6031.04, Patient Care.

Office was responsible for observing Mr. Epstein and documenting his behavior while on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. Office mistakenly used a Suicide Watch Log Book intended for inmate companion documentation between 1:40 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on July 23, 2019, when he should have been using the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. Drug Treatment Specialist, reportedly noticed this error and subsequently hand copied all of Office entries from 1:40 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. into a Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. She then initialed these entries, and this makes it appear as if she was the one conducting the watch. This information was discovered and conveyed in an e-mail from Ms. Charisma Edge, Associate Warden to with a carbon copy to Warden N’Diaye on August 12, 2019. Of note, did not make an entry explaining why she was making the log book changes. Additionally, then wrote entries for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. in the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. These were not a part of the original entries made by Office nor was assigned to work the Suicide Watch post. Due to the inability to interview staff at this time, it is unknown why attempted to correct Office error, or made any of the subsequent log entries. It is recommended that if a staff member makes an entry error (e.g., writes in the incorrect suicide watch log book), the staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.

A review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing on 10 occasions and a medical provider’s signature is missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information on the BP-A0292.

A review of Psychology Observation Log Books revealed significant discrepancies from the approved Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly rounds and sign the log book; 179

9

Page 492

out of 183 round signatures were missing. The lieutenant is required to sign the log book one time per shift and signatures were missing in 10 of 23 instances. A Physician Assistant is required to sign one time per shift and 16 of 16 instances were missing.

5. **Telephone Calls**: In a PDS-BEMR note written by on July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manager on August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family. (who was the Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call. Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told he was calling his mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

6. **Direct Observation**: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was without “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.

7. **Follow-Up**: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m. institution count that evening Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-mail she sent to and Lieutenant last night that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as “distraught, sad and a little confused.” She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was

10

Page 493

okay, and he reportedly said he was. However, [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenant [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] opened the e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Additionally, if [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] was concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*, requires her to maintain direct, continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] at approximately 9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this. Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.” Furthermore, P5324.07, *SENTRY Psychology Alert Function* states, “When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.” [B)(6)

Both of these groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided R&amp;D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The USMS requested R&amp;D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m. [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] sent [b)(6); (b)(7)(C)] an e-mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Specifically, when a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,

11

Page 494

continuous observation until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by for a suicide risk assessment on August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate inmate and Mr. Epstein were all assigned to the same cell. On August 13, 2019, at 12:06 p.m. and 12:08 p.m., a quarters history roster was generated for inmate and respectively. Inmate and all were respectively. Inmate and all were all assigned to the same cell. Inmate and all were all assigned to the same cell. Inmate and all were all assigned to the same cell. Inmate and all were all assigned to the same cell.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate in cell 207L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate in cell 212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate in cell 220L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-054). The locator shows inmate and inmate in cell 206. The photo sheets show the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes’ identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to H01-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.

12

Page 495

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death. Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.

11. Post Orders &amp; SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign-In Sheets were reviewed for the 3rd Quarter, spanning June 9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Officer [6981 (b)679C] failed to sign post orders for SHU #3 post.

Quarterly SHU Training Sign-In Sheets were reviewed. The 2019 3rd Quarter SHU Training was conducted on June 6, 2019. Three staff assigned to the 3rd Quarter SHU Roster in SHU did not attend or receive the SHU Training: Officer [6981 (b)679C], Officer [6981 (b)679C] and Officer [6981 (b)679C]

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing

13

Page 496

the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

13. **Sex Offense Risk Factors**: A broad understanding of risk factors associated with sex offenders, by staff at MCC New York, did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison.

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with

either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.

As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as

possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

# Focus of Session

Inmate Epstein was seen today for a follow-up session in SHU.

# Subjective/Objective Presentation

Inmate Epstein stated he is feeling okay and has been eating his meals. He reported his sleep as "fair" and would like to go the general population. He denied any mental health symptoms at this time and denied any feelings of depression and/or anxiety. Inmate Epstein denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He currently has a cellmate and appears to interact with him. Inmate Epstein continues to spend his days and evening with his attorney's in the attorney conference room. He told this writer he received his PAC number to make phone calls. Inmate Epstein indicated he has only had a couple of phone calls over the speaker phone and wondered "if that counted" as his monthly phone contact. He also reported he his missing some books he was reading in the suicide watch area prior to returning to the SHU.

Other than complaints about the prison and concerns regarding his housing, he had no mental health concerns today. He did not appear to be in any distress and the SHU Staff have not reported any unusual behaviors on his part.

# Intervention(s)

Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was receptive to these interventions.

# Progress/Plan

Inmate EPSTEIN was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology staff.

(b)(7)(A)

When this writer attempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have such impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood my position.

Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it "a punishment cell." He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong.

He stated he has not received the phone calls he was promised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the attorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed the times when staff members have attempted to give him phone calls and recreation.

Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating "I am too vested in my case to fight it, I have a life and I want to go back to living my life." He denied any acute symptoms at this time.

According to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has also been attending his daily legal visits.

He has never received inpatient or outpatient mental health treatment and denied any history of suicidality. Currently, he does not exhibit any acute psychopathology, is currently psychologically stable and is in no psychological distress. As such, he is being classified as a CC1-MH inmate at this time. CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who either has no identifiable mental illness (Axis I "No Diagnosis") or is mildly ill and requires clinical intervention on an as-needed basis.

# Care Level Formulation

CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who shows no significant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and demonstrates no need for regular mental health intervention.

# MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

## Correctional Services

### Inmate Accountability: SHU

- A whiteboard has been installed in the Special Housing Unit identifying the cell assignment of each inmate and pertinent information of each inmate which aids in accountability. This assists in correcting cell assignment discrepancies and aid in identifying programing needs (3 man hold, razor restriction, etc.).
- TDY Staff have been assisting Correctional Services with vacant positions; Correctional Officers, Lieutenant's and Deputy Captain.
- Addition to the Captains 2 hour SHU video review, IDO's are reviewing 6 hours of SHU video encompassing all three shift weekly.
- IDO's are conduction Bed book counts on weekends during the 10:00 am count.
- Single cell report emailed to the Warden each shift and receives approval memorandum for each.
- Morning Watch Lieutenant supervises one count in SHU and is documented in the LT's Log.

## Psychology

- Running Hospital Rosters Every Morning to see if inmates on SW are in the proper cells according to their Sentry assignments. Inconsistencies are reported the Associate Warden of Programs. Further, C&amp;A is contacted to make appropriate corrections on the roster.
- Court rosters are reviewed every day to see if any Psy Alerts are going out to court so that we can check in with them upon their return.
- PSY ALERT inmate assignments are considered for inmates with ongoing risk factors associated with suicidality (e.g., sex offender status, high profile) even regardless of whether they exhibit substantial acute mental health symptoms.
- The Chief Psychologist has written a new procedural Memorandum for Psy Alert inmates which is undergoing review in Central Office.
- Psychology has been routing Hot List via e-mail to Lieutenant's and Executive Staff each time new inmates are added to the hot list.

Page 644

# MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

- Psychology has been providing feedback at Executive Staff Meetings regarding inmates at-risk for suicidality and discussing cellmate placement (both GP and SHU) for inmates with significant mental health issues and suicide risk factors.
- When inmates are added and released from Suicide Watch, an email and a phone call is made to Warden and the Operations Lieutenant notifying them of the addition or termination of the watch as well as their need for cellmates. This recommendation is also placed in the Post Suicide Watch Report in PDS and the psychologist indicates exactly who they contacted about the inmate's need for a cellmate in the recommendation section of the report.
- Suicide Watch Books are reviewed daily by a psychologist and audited to see if the Unit Officer and Lieutenant make appropriate rounds and signed the log books each shift (MW, DW, and EW). Inconsistencies are sent to the Captain and Associate Warden of Programs.

## Correctional Systems

- Since September 9, 2019, inmates have been tracked when released from court by utilizing the PP63 Sentry function as opposed to tracking by out count. There has been no issues to date utilizing this procedure.
- All releases are being reviewed by a higher authority other than the CSO/SCSS. Typically reviewed by the Case Management Coordinator.

## Correctional Programs

### Inmate Accountability:

- New bed books have been provided to each unit. A daily schedule of bed book counts has been established to ensure appropriate accountability of all inmates. Bed book counts are notated in the Daily Lieutenant Logs for Executive Staff review. Additionally, an Executive Staff member is present each evening to monitor this process and identify discrepancies. All discrepancies are typically corrected immediately.

Page 645

# MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

- Daily Camera status reports of the status of high priority areas; SHU, 10 South, Suicided Watch, Female unit and 3 Sally.

## Facilities

### Cameras:

- The FBI removed the previous camera system (DVR) and the new system (NVR) has been installed and is operational. Additional cameras have been added in SHU which are digital. Within the next 6 months additional cameras will be added to the system with a target completion date of April 2020.
- MCC has a total of [SSTGES] cameras. Currently, [SSTGES] cameras are connected to the NICE DVR System and are operational and recording. The [SSTGES] camera is inoperable and in the process of being replaced (bad camera). The anticipated date of completion is within the next two weeks.
- The new NVR has the capability to monitor and record [SSTGES] cameras. The following locations have been identified as needing coverage: elevators, receiving and discharge, all inmate housing units, sallyports, and outside perimeter.

## Summary

- To date all information requested by OIG and FBI has been provided.
- Health Services has received the autopsy results from the NY Medical Examiner’s office on inmate Epstein and is secured
- TDY staff assigned to NYM have all been hard working and team players.
- Staff morale at MCC New York is average in light of the most recent event; however, they are resilient and working hard as a team to move forward. They have embraced the TDY staff that have arrived and have been extremely courteous and receptive to ensure everyone works together.

Page 646

# MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

## Current Assessment:

Some of the issues identified are due to seriously reduced staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and oversight. Since January 1, 2019, MCC New York has hired 18 staff and lost 33 staff to retirement, and transfers within the BOP and other agencies.

To date approximately approximately 148 staff from multiple regions assisted NYM which we are very grateful for their assistance. All subject matter TDY staff are required to provide a report to the Warden prior to their departure. This report is similar to a Program Review report and includes areas of concern, tasks done well and recommendations. These reports will be shared with the Associate Wardens and Department Heads for guidance.

Further, to ensure the training and efforts that will occur is sustainable, there will need to be continuous oversight by leadership. Therefore, several positions will need to be added to the staff compliment, such as an Associate Warden over Correctional Services, a Deputy Captain, and an Assistant Case Management Coordinator, Assistant Food Services Administrator, to name a few.

MEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, REENTRY SERVICES DIVISION

FROM: M. Licon-Vitale, Warden, MCC New York
SUBJECT: Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction
Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054)

This is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054) dated December 27, 2019.

## 2. 30 Minute Rounds

The substance of the two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video review is unclear. Please clarify the requirement for the Captain and IDO. Additionally, please identify the documentation used to maintain accountability of the reviews.

Institution Response:

Video review requirements have been instituted by NERO. Specifically [807SE] of each week, the institution is notified by NERO of the date, time, and SHU range in which to download video. The video is a two hour block. The video is to be reviewed by the Captain. During the reviews the Captain is looking for strict adherence to the requirements that rounds be conducted at least once during every 30-minute period, not to exceed 40 minutes between rounds and that all scheduled counts are being conducted in the SHU. The Captain will then submit an assurance memo to the institutional executive staff and Correctional Services Administrator (CSA) indicating the designated video footage was reviewed, and corrective actions which were taken for any deficiencies noted. This memorandum will be submitted to the Regional Office by COB on [807SE]

Institutional Duty Officers (IDOs) are required to review 6 hours of SHU video. The surveillance footage is downloaded by the institutional SIA and a compact disk is provided to the IDOs for review. The IDOs are reviewing the video for accuracy of the 30 minute rounds. All reviews are documented in the weekly IDO Report.

Page 685

## 3. Cellmate Assignments

Documentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the importance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes consultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision making of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members present when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not accurately reflect what occurred.

### Institution Response:

As was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions were made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff meetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or Acting Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on housing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate presents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a sex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates. Moving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where housing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with psychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs. Please see the attached checklist.

## 4. Documentation Accuracy

Professional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted in your response. However, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in documentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.

As noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be written within 24 hours of having the information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative explanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.

Please develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for writing incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include an outline of the training and evidence of staff who attended the training.

### Institution Response:

Additional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In addition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when it is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more appropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual Training began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2020.

Page 686

## 5. Telephone Calls

As noted in the response, there is a lack of documentation to substantiate that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, this does not address the report of two telephone calls being provided. This response implies that the reporting of two staff members is inaccurate.

The response neglects the documented telephone call to Mr. Epstein's deceased mother.

**Institution Response:**

On August 29, 2019, Warden J. Petrucci, signed a referral related to [text cut off 102] failure to follow policy in allowing Epstein to complete an unmonitored phone call. The referral was submitted to the Office of Internal Affairs on that same date and is pending further action at this time.

## 7. Follow-Up

Please provide documentation for the follow-up training provided to staff detailing the content of the training and to whom it was provided.

**Institution Response:**

As recommended by Central Office, the Chief Psychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings during Department Head Meetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenant’s Trainings. The follow-up training sign-in sheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails provided by psychology staff regarding PSY ALERT Inmates are attached for your review.

## 8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy

Periodic and unannounced checks are now conducted in SHU to determine pp30 assignments and actual inmate placement match. Please provide an operational definition of periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it relates Executive Staff bed book counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be documented and will they include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them?

**Institution Response:**

An Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule has been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and 10 A.M. weekend bed book counts. Any discrepancies noted are documented and sent via email to Unit Mangers and Captain at the conclusion of each count for corrective action. Please see the attached schedule.

## 9. Attorney Log Books

Please provide a copy of the log book audit.

**Institution Response:**

The audit revealed the **Random Visitor Log Book** did not reflect visitor pat searches after May 19, 2019. In addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The **Contractor/Volunteer Log Book** was not always filled in properly. The **Law Enforcement Log Book** was up to date; however, the time of departure was not always documented. The **Attorney Log** was missing inmate register numbers and more often than not was legible. There was no **Visitor Denial Log** created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is attached for your review.

Page 687

Additional corrective measures will now include the Activities Lieutenant checking all Front Lobby log books. The Captain will ensure these checks are included in the Lieutenant’s Daily Log for Day Watch and Evening Watch. In addition, the Activities Lieutenant will address any discrepancies immediately through on the spot training and/or performance log entries.

## 13. Sex Offense Risk Factors

Psychologists are subject matter experts in sex offender risk factors and they play a crucial role in sharing this knowledge through traditional settings such as ICT, AT, and institutional meetings. However, Executive Staff play a pivotal role in establishing and addressing institutional culture and promoting and participating in training. A lack of a broad understanding of sex offender specific risk factors requires an intentional training approach led by Executive Staff. They must be out front talking about inmates with a sex offense, expressing an understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency condoned expectations for the understanding and treatment of inmates with a sex offenses, and assisting with institutional trainings. These practices encourage a broader acceptance by line staff.

**Institution Response:**

The MCC New York Executive Staff are out front talking about inmates with sex offenses, and expressing an understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency expectations for the understanding and treatment of inmates with sex offenses. This is done through departmental meetings, trainings, staff recalls and walking and talking throughout the institution.

# MEMORANDUM FOR HUGH J. HURWITZ, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, REENTRY SERVICES DIVISION

FROM: J. Petrucci, Warden, MCC New York
SUBJECT: Institution Response to Psychological Reconstruction
Inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054)

This is the response to the psychological reconstruction of inmate Epstein, Jeffrey (76318-054) dated September 17, 2019.

1. Single Ceiling: (IUS)

Institution Response: 1. Single Cell Placement:

A system has been put in place to ensure inmates are not single celled. A single cell report is completed during each shift by the SHU Lieutenant during Day Watch and the Operations Lieutenant during the Morning Watch and Evening Watch. Notifications are made to the Institution Duty Officer (IDO) and Executive Staff.

Psychology discusses the status of inmates who are at-risk for suicidality, their housing needs, as well as their needs for cellmates during staff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings.

When inmates are placed on and off suicide watch, the Warden is notified verbally, regardless of the time of day. The Warden then determines which suicide watch area a suicidal inmate will be housed and if they will be observed with an inmate companions or a staff member.

Page 753

Psychology verbally notifies the Operations Lieutenant when inmates are removed from suicide watch and that they will need to be placed with a cellmate. Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from suicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population setting. The C&amp;A officer is responsible for entering the proper assignment.

Once an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and Lieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate. The e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for a cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in BEMR/PDS.

Psychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of inmates on a watch status.

2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.

**Institution Response: 2. Rounds:**

SHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within the policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a daily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets will be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must observe all inmates confined in continuous locked down status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour, followed by another round in the second 30 minute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be documented. Closer observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre behavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take more security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video review are being conducted.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2019
[8:17(A)]
[8:17(A)]
In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019, [8:18(L)(b)(7)(C)] sent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scott, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between [8:18(L)(b)(7)(C)] and [8:18(L)(b)(7)(C)] National Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [8:18(L)(b)(7)(C)] Reviewed the consult and recommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another inmate who had also been accused of committing a sex offense. There is no evidence this information was considered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a sexual offense.
[8:15]

# Institution Response: 3. Cellmate Assignments:

Inmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens, Warden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s attorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making recommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled. Psychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares their knowledge with Executive Staff.

The psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr. Epstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. However, that is not correct. MCC New York Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein, including but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.

Prior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology staff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narrowed the list down to the most appropriate candidates.

Most of the other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be housed with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses, was deemed dangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narrowed the possibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-054, was placed in SHU for claims he was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Attorney’s Office. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.

Based on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate in SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York Executive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators who are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.

4. Documentation Accuracy:

It is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective evidence.

Recommended that staff remain open to all reasonable explanations for a behavior and take the appropriate actions when a final determination is made. Although the incident report was later expunged, inmates frequently experience significant stress when they contemplate the potential consequences associated with findings of guilt.

BeWeB: de07EC) entered a Psychology Services Intake Screening into PDS-BEMR on July 8, 2010. The document has three typographical errors. She selected the No Sexual Offense Convictions check box when, in fact, Mr. Epstein was previously convicted of Solicitation of Prostitution and Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution. Second, Mr. Epstein was erroneously identified as a Black male in this document. Finally, there is one instance where he was mistakenly referred to as BeWeB: de07EC)

BeWeB: de07EC) completed a Risk of Sexual Abusiveness document on July 8, 2019. She marked "History of prior prison sexual predation" in the affirmative. This is not accurate.

BeWeB: de07EC) Mid-Level Practitioner, completed a History and Physical on July 9, 2019. An Intake Screening should have been conducted within 24 hours of his entry into Bureau custody which was on July 6, 2019, according to P6031.04, Patient Care.

Officer BeWeB: de07EC) was responsible for observing Mr. Epstein and documenting his behavior while on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. Officer BeWeB: de07EC) mistakenly used a Suicide Watch Log Book intended for inmate companion documentation between 1:40 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on July 23, 2019, when he should have been using the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. Ms. BeWeB: Drug Treatment Specialist, reportedly noticed this error and subsequently hand copied all of Officer BeWeB: de07EC) entries from 1:40 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. into a Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. She then initialed these entries, and this makes it appear as if she was the one conducting the watch. This information was discovered and conveyed in an e-mail from Ms. Charisma Edge, Associate Warden to [BeWeB: de07EC) with a carbon copy to Warden N'Diaye on August 12, 2019. Of note, Ms. [BeWeB: de07EC) did not make an entry explaining why she was making the log book changes. Additionally, Ms. [BeWeB: de07EC) then wrote entries for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. in the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. These were not a part of the original entries made by Officer [BeWeB: de07EC) nor was Ms. [BeWeB: de07EC) assigned to work the Suicide Watch post. Due to the inability to interview staff at this time, it is unknown why Ms. [BeWeB: de07EC) attempted to correct Officer [BeWeB: de07EC) error, or made any of the subsequent log entries. It is recommended that if a staff member makes an entry error (e.g., writes in the incorrect suicide watch log book), the staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.

A review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing on 10 occasions and a medical provider's signature is missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information on the BP-A0292.

A review of Psychology Observation Log Books revealed significant discrepancies from the approved Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly rounds and sign the log book.

179 out of 183 round signatures were missing. The lieutenant is required to sign the log book one time per shift and signatures were missing in 10 of 23 instances. A Physician Assistant is required to sign one time per shift and 16 of

Page 756

16 instances were missing. $^{3)(5)}$

Institution Response: 4. Documentation Accuracy:

The Reconstruction team indicates it is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective evidence, and references $^{3)(7)(A)}$

In reference to typographical errors noted in PDS/BEMR notes, the Chief Psychologist has spoken to all psychology staff members concerning proof reading all documents entered to reduce typos and to improve information accuracy. Additionally, there is a second Staff Psychologist in the department which helps reduce the workload on current psychologists, allowing more time for documentation review.

Regarding the Reconstruction team’s concerns in reference to Mr. Epstein’s expunged incident report, staff shall continue to follow Program Statement 5270.09, Inmate Discipline Program in writing incident reports as appropriate. As more complex matters (including attempted suicide) warrant, Special Investigative Services staff will conduct appropriate investigations and make a determination as to whether an incident report is warranted. Psychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.

The Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records reflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D) area on July 6, 2019, at approximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician Assistant (PA $^{3)(6)}$ on the same night and approximately 14 minutes after his arrival in R&amp;D. On July 9, 2019, he was placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately 12:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological Observation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA $^{6)(6)(7)(C)}$ within three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6031.04, Patient Care, a provider must perform a History and Physical within 14 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical and Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.

Regarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug Abuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide watch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log book written by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as he had written in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff log book. However, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone else observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide watch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are now being closely monitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.

Incomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s on a daily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every Sunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwritten manner.

The Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.

Page 757

The Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Both Staff and the Lieutenants received additional training on when they are required to complete rounds and sign Suicide Watch log books. With regard to suicide watch log books signatures, correctional staff are required to perform routine rounds every hour. The 2 Sally Officer on Monday-Friday during Day Watch is required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates as prescribed by the Captain. After-hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals, collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal 1 or Internal 2 assisting with duties as assigned by the Captain. Additionally, Psychology staff check the suicide watch logs daily when they interview the inmates on suicide watch. If it is noted hourly rounds are not being conducted by the Unit Officer and/or the Lieutenants are not rounding and signing the books each shift, the Associate Warden over Programs and the Captain are notified immediately and enforce accountability.

5. Telephone Calls: In a PDS-BEMR note written by [dot#1; dot73C] on July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manager [dot#1; dot73C] on August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family. Mr. [dot#1; dot73C] (who was the Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call.

Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told Mr. [dot#2; dot73C] he was calling his mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

[dot#5]

**Institution Response: 5. Telephone calls:**

There is no documentation to substantiate that a Lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, there is documented evidence that Unit Manager [dot#1; dot73C] provided a call to Mr. Epstein on July 30, 2019, at 5:15 p.m., to a [dot#1; dot73C] friend, on a monitored telephone/speaker phone. The call was documented in a log that is maintained in the Correctional Systems Department. Mr. Epstein was provided a call because he had not been able to conduct voice recording on the inmate telephone. This is standard procedure by the Unit Team at MCC New York, to occasionally provide a call to new arrivals, when necessary.

6. Direct Observation: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an Attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was without "direct, continuous observation" by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New York's Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.

**Institution Response: 6. Direct Observation:**

The Psychology Department has eliminated Psychology Observation at MCC-NY. Inmates on Suicide Watch are only provided legal visits under special circumstances as deemed by the Court.

7. Follow-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m. institution count that evening [du8; du7xG] Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-mail she sent to Drs. [du8; du7xG] and [du8; du7xG] and Lieutenant [du8; du7xG] later that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as "distraught, sad and a little confused." She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he was. However, Ms. [du8; du7xG] noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, "He seems dazed and withdrawn." She went on to say, "So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him." Despite the fact that Lieutenant [du8; du7xG] opened the e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if Ms. [du8; du7xG] was concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct, continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When [du8; du7xG] opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by [du8; du7xG] at approximately 9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.

Specifically PSY ALERT is used "to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate." Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, "When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff." Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided R&amp;D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice indicated Mr. Epstein had "MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies." The USMS requested R&amp;D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m., Dr. [du8; du7xG] sent Dr. [du8; du7xG] an e-mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct, continuous observation until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. [du8; du7xG] for a suicide risk assessment on August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

**Institution Response: 7. Follow Up:**

Staff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant when they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.

As part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the following: “If you are emailing about an inmate that may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact

7

Page 759

(verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist. Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of the inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”

The Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or identification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our institution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.

R&amp;D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified immediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the general population.

Inmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a member of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general population. R&amp;D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates entering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY ALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be notified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to screen the inmate in R&amp;D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other pertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.

Inmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution. Psychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment, but will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.

The attached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and implemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follow-up procedures when existing PSY ALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an existing PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the institution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology Department will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology Department will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These reports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is scheduled to go out to court the following day.

When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department returns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or concerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their return to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time if a PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to general population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there is no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.

8

Page 760

When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department returns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office, they will be screened by a member of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress regarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.

Per guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with R&amp;D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and suicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology Services Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding PSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D), Psychology and Health Services staff.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein's SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate $^{\text{dot}(d078G)}$ inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ and Mr. Epstein were all assigned to the same cell. On August 13, 2019, at 12:06 p.m. and 12:08 p.m., a quarters history roster was generated for inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ and $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ respectively. Inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from August 5, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-212UAD. Inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ cell assignment was Z04-206UAD from August 1, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history roster was generated for Mr. Epstein on August 13, 2019, at 9:07 a.m. His cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ in cell 207L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ in cell 212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate Epstein in cell 220L (SENTRY never shows him in this cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-054). The locator shows inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ and inmate $^{\text{dot}(d079G)}$ in cell 206. The photo sheets show the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes' identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code HO1 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to H01-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

**Institution Response: 8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy:**

With regard to the accuracy and accountability of inmates placed on suicide watch status in the hospital area, Psychology Services now runs a daily SENTRY roster of all the inmates on suicide watch in that area. The roster is examined to ensure that the inmates placed on suicide watch in a suicide watch cell are keyed into SENTRY with

9

Page 761

the correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies. Moreover, the four suicide watch cells now all have SENTRY Assignments of H01-001L – H01-004L. Further, Psychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants have conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly rounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain and the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.

The Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP30 Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on suicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&amp;A) Officer keys cell assignments correctly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the Lieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that upon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&amp;A and providing the cell assignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP30 with the selection category for suicide watch. The Operations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is in the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate bed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.

Additionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology staff by telephone when the need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the Warden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate whether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of this determination.

To ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks are conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP30 Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant. Executive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed. Results will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is responsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants Log.

In order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due to the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along with a SENTRY PP30 Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish better oversight over inmate accountability.

Correctional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day watch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as prescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals, collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal 1 or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as assigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and responsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll Call notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, "In the event of a suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred." This policy further states, "All possible

10

Page 762

evidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a psychological reconstruction."

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

**Institution Response: 9. Attorney Log Books:**

On August 10, 2019, log books deemed relevant to the investigation were removed from various locations throughout the facility. The Reconstruction Team did identify pertinent logbooks that had not been secured. At this time, all relevant logbooks have been removed and replaced. In addition, a logbook audit was conducted to ensure accuracy of the documentation and compliance with policy. Measures are being taken to ensure in the future that all relevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can continue to run efficiently.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.

**Institution Response: 10: Automatic External Defibrillators:**

A review of the Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) report presented by Great Lakes Biomedical Services dated July 22, 2019, revealed that all AEDS were accounted for and were placed in the correct respective areas. The report was accurate and complete. New AEDs have been purchased and will be inspected Great Lakes Biomedical Services upon their arrival. The list reviewed by the reconstruction team was an old and outdated list from January 8, 2018.

Medical staff provides training and conducts monthly inspections of all AEDs in the institution. Great Lakes Biomedical Services, an outside contractor, conducts a bi-annual inspection and provides a report. Procedures on inspecting all AEDS in the institution have been prepared and are awaiting approval. These procedures are attached hereto.

11. Post Orders &amp; SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign-In Sheets were reviewed for the 3rd Quarter, spanning June 9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Office [608]: (b)(7)(C) failed to sign post orders for SHU #3 post.

Quarterly SHU Training Sign-In Sheets were reviewed. The 2019 3rd Quarter SHU Training was conducted on June 6, 2019. Three staff assigned to the 3rd Quarter SHU Roster in SHU did not attend or receive the SHU Training: Officer [608]: (b)(7)(C) Officer [608]: (b)(7)(C) and Officer [608]: (b)(7)(C)

**Institution Response: 11. Post Orders &amp; SHU Training:**

The Suicide Watch Post Orders are located in the Lieutenant’s Office and SHU with a quarterly sign-in sheet. A copy of the Suicide Watch Post Orders will also be placed in a secure container outside of the suicide watch cells on Tier H in SHU. This container will also hold signature sheets and additional Staff Suicide Watch Log Books.

11

Page 763

All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the staff suicide watch. Attached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permitting staff monitored suicide watches in SHU.

With regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. However, the sign-in sheets for this training are now be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is assigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the Chief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.

SHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from Psychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will be completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be allotted time during that day to complete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not received the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to attend another training day as assigned by the Captain.

Staff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be maintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2nd Floor. A chronological record of events will commence immediately upon the initiation of watch. It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a blank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each log book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall be clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are made.

During some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In this instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant visual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual observation (yellow). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion log book every 60 minutes.

Lights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will make rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays, eating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not prescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.

The inmate will be outfitted in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive mattress and if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate Companions are not allowed to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them from maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on suicide watch.

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

12

Page 764

## Institution Response: 12. Staffing:

The Drug Abuse Coordinator position is currently a shared position. The Warden has re-established the Drug Abuse Coordinator position as a full-time position to provide the Psychology Department with an additional supervisory psychologist to perform critical clinical services. At the current time, the position is pending selection.

We are currently in the process of requesting to hire a Staff Psychologist position to provide additional psychological services to inmates in the SHU, including therapy sessions with PSY ALERT, CC2-MH and CC3-MH inmates who are currently housed there. An additional psychologist could also monitor Hot List inmates arriving to the SHU and ensure they are housed with appropriate cellmates. This psychologist could conduct daily rounds to look for signs of psychological distress and address the concerns of our Long Term SHU inmates. Finally, an additional Staff Psychologist could assist with our daily crisis interventions and suicide risk assessments.

13. Sex Offense Risk Factors: A broad understanding of risk factors associated with sex offenders, by staff at MCC New York, did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison. A more

## Institution Response: 13. Sex Offense Risk Factors:

The Chief Psychologist is a member of the Executive Staff. The Chief Psychologist or her designee continues to be present at all Executive Staff meetings, Department Head meetings, and SHU meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist offers feedback regarding the treatment and management of sex offender inmates. Additionally, the Chief Psychologist continues to educate all staff during Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT) and Annual Training (AT) about the sex offender specific risk factors and suicidality.

Hi

MCC Administrators have been in touch with [dojf: do7jC] at the USMS since early this morning. I too have been in touch with [dojf: do7jC] since a little after 9 am, at which time I shared the limited information I had. The press release is the sum total of the information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is more information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further since it is an open investigation.

Thank you,

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.

continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

I was informed by 000000 that he had submitted my completed application to the legal department for the inmate Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your records?

I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. I was told today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.

I really appreciate your help.

My boss, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, sent a formal request to Governor Ron DeSantis to have the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to assume the lead role in the administrative review-criminal investigation while Mr. Epstein was under the care and control of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, copies of those requests are attached.

I met with part of the FDLE investigative team yesterday and turned over to them the start of our investigation.

Below you will find the POC from FDLE and with your permission I'd like to forward your contact information to him if he would need to contact your office.

Inspector
Office of Executive Investigations – FDLE

@fdle.state.fl.us

Insp. should have copies of those records now, I will reach out to him today and with FDLE approval, since they are now the investigative lead, I will facilitate your office in obtaining those records directly from us.

I will be back in touch as quickly as possible.

Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. [607]A I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because [607]A or more comfortable for him. [607]A He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. Thank you. [607]C

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse [text: (607)C] saw him.

Page 1562

Page 851

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

He is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with [style: dot79C] who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. I am looking at the SHU Roster now to see who can be a good cell mate.

This is the response I am sending the RD. Are you ok with this?

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [style: dot79C] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary

Page 1685

Page 869

designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

his case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [b)(6)(d)(6)(7)(c)] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [b)(6)(d)(6)(7)(c)

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

If you happen to get this tonight, maybe you can call me on my cell at 202-32[图片]: My boss may want to answer this reporter tonight, but before we send an answer perhaps like the one below we wanted to see for our own internal awareness what you may know about this if any of it is true in regard to Epstein.

My mobile Samsung is not always receiving emails and leaving work now, so my personal cell by calling the number above is best if you get this.

Thanks so much,

While I will probably reply to this reporter with something like my draft below which doesn't reveal much if anything, nonetheless we want to be sure we understand from you or the institution what if anything may have happened with inmate Epstein. Could you see if the institution can look into this and provide us with what they may know for our internal purposes (not for release to media)? We will reply to media inquiries about Epstein (not the institution) since stories about him are national news (unless we finalize an answer that we could give to the institution to use as well if media ask about this tomorrow).

Thanks,

# PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result, information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support actionable findings and recommendations is limited.

Name: Jeffrey Epstein
Register Number: 76318-054
Date of Death: 08-10-2019
Prepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Psychology Services Branch, Central Office

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Mr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August 10, 2019, while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C. Wills, former Acting Assistant Director, Reentry Services Division, appointed a team to conduct a psychological reconstruction. The team consisted of National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, Central Office Sex Offender Treatment Programs Coordinator, Central Office, Mental Health Treatment Coordinator, Central Office; and Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Regional Office. This reconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement 5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program.

**Social History:** Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of the reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible. The following was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in 1953 and grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein graduated from Lafayette High School in 1969, at the age of 16. He attended Cooper Union and New York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School, a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from September 1974 until he was

1

Page 975

dismissed in June 1976 for inadequate development as a teacher. Following that, he held a number of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at Bear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknown policy violations in 1981. He also worked as a financial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.

Mr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a consultant with 60(6); (b)(7)(C) in the late 1980s. was described as his first mentor. was later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi scheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his own personal use. Years later, Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company, granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his considerable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence and charismatic personality.

Legal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In June 2008, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count Solicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 30 months: 18 months of incarceration and 12 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the National Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served 13 of his 18-month incarceration and then successfully completed 12 months of probation. It is unclear whether he followed the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he owned a residence.

In regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and Sex Trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), (b) (2), 2 on July 2, 2019. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females over the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited minor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated with cash following the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor females to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not guilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.

In a 37-page Decision &amp; Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman on July 18, 2019, 18 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others and the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s proposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held on remand.

## Institutional History

On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22 hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population.

With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

## HEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION

BOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis unspecified. He was prescribed the following mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia, omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication. However, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,” thus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications prescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine which is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.

In regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no known available records. Any records that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were not available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System records in BEMR (PDS-BEMR), Forensic Psychologist at MCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2019. During this screening, Mr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No symptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level 1 and was not diagnosed with a mental illness.

Following a consultation with National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on July 8, 2019, Chief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein should be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary consideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and media attention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding. Mr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2019, after normal business hours. He denied suicidal

3

Page 977

thoughts at that time, but due to the potential for other risk factors listed above, the on-call psychologist placed Mr. Epstein on Psychological Observation in one of the suicide watch cells until he could be assessed in person by a BOP psychologist. Psychological Observation is a form of individual monitoring that is less restrictive than Suicide Watch. It is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general population or restrictive housing. It is often used to transition inmates off of Suicide Watch in order to monitor their transition and safety after an acute suicidal crisis. On July 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein underwent a formal, in-person suicide risk assessment with [link: d07)(C). She determined that, while suicide watch was not warranted at that time, Mr. Epstein should remain on Psychological Observation status out of an abundance of caution. He was removed from Psychological Observation on July 10, 2019.

[107(A)]
[107(A)]
He was placed on suicide watch by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately 1:40 a.m. pending a formal in-person suicide risk assessment. [link: d07)(C). Staff Psychologist at MCC New York, assessed Mr. Epstein for risk of suicide later in the morning of July 23, 2019, and determined he should remain on suicide watch. [107(A)]
[107(A)]

Mr. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes. Thereafter, he remained in the suicide watch cell and was placed on Psychological Observation, where he remained housed until July 30, 2019, according to PDS-BEMR records. A discrepancy exists regarding when he was removed from Psychological Observation. His cell assignment, per SENTRY, indicates he was transferred back to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on July 29, 2019, whereas PDS-BEMR indicates he was removed from Psychological Observation on July 30, 2019, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

Mr. Epstein attended a court hearing on July 31, 2019, and, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided paperwork to Receiving and Discharge (R&amp;D) staff that noted “suicidal tendencies.” [link: d07)(C) was notified on August 1, 2019, about this paperwork. She consulted with [link: d07)(C) and then met with Mr. Epstein to conduct a suicide risk assessment. She determined suicide watch was not warranted at that time.

Mr. Epstein remained classified as a Mental Health Care Level 1 throughout his time at MCC New York. During his contacts with psychologists, Mr. Epstein routinely denied current mental health symptoms to include suicidal ideation, and he did not exhibit symptoms of a serious mental illness. However, there was evidence Mr. Epstein was experiencing challenges

Page 978

adjusting to his environment and changes in his lifestyle. He reported frequent complaints of difficulty sleeping. He did not have access to his CPAP machine until it was reportedly provided to him on July 30, 2019. Mr. Epstein also reported he was bothered by noise in the SHU. At times, he noted concerns related to his safety in SHU or on a general population housing unit. On two occasions, July 26, 2019, and July 27, 2019, he described himself as a coward and as someone who does not like pain. On July 28, 2019, he told the toilet in his cell would not stop flushing for an extended period of time, and he then took to sitting in the corner with his hands over his ears. Mr. Epstein indicated he was agitated following this incident and was unable to sleep that night.

## ANTECEDENT CIRCUMSTANCES

Mr. Epstein entered BOP custody on July 6, 2019, with a history of convictions for sexual offenses and allegations comprised of more serious charges. The current indictment alleged sexual crimes against minors, and he was facing up to 45 years in prison. On July 18, 2019, Mr. Epstein’s request for bail and pretrial release was denied.

On July 30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from Psychological Observation. sent an e-mail reporting Mr. Epstein had been removed from Psychological Observation and needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate. This e-mail was sent to 71 MCC New York staff and, as of August 13, 2019, only 27 staff members had opened the message.  |

On August 9, 2019, a federal court unsealed approximately 2,000 pages of documents into the public domain. These included graphic allegations against Mr. Epstein. Included was a book order receipt for titles such as SM 101: A Realistic Introduction; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners. Additional high profile public figures were also named in the released documents. The documents were part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a woman who alleged Mr. Epstein had victimized her, against a British socialite, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, associate, and alleged to have assisted with his criminal activities. According to staff report, Mr. Epstein was afforded telephone calls on two different days although it is unknown whether they were legal or social calls. No recording of the calls exist and it is not known with whom he was speaking. One occurred on or around July 16, 2019, and the other on August 9, 2019. Legal calls are not monitored, and would not be recorded. A social call would be recorded; given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein, knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with him.

Following his final telephone call on the evening of August 9, 2019, Mr. Epstein was moved into his SHU cell. He was single-celled at that time because his cellmate (Efrain Reyes #85993-054)

5

Page 979

did not return from court. The need for a cellmate was communicated between Day Watch (DW) and Evening Watch (EW) shifts in the SHU, but no cellmate was placed with him by the EW staff. According to a memorandum from Senior Officer Specialist SHU staff were informed at approximately 1:50 p.m. that Mr. Epstein’s cellmat would likely not return from court. Furthermore, Officer noted Mr. Epstein would need a cellmate upon arrival from his attorney visit.

A review of the 30-minute rounds forms indicate unit rounds were completed for the entire MW shift on August 10, 2019. However, a memorandum from Lieutenant indicates Officer and Material Handler Supervisor made a statement after Mr. Epstein’s death that they did not complete proper 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m.

## DESCRIPTION OF SCENE

A detailed description of the scene was unavailable because the officers who discovered Mr. Epstein did not write memorandums and could not be interviewed. According to the Report of Incident, on August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in the SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called for medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff stated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED reportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to Health Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at 6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:10 a.m. Mr. Epstein was pronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing video footage.

## CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

A general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when reviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide, were likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in individuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of sexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to utilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative affect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the loss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the loss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide among individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences, and lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.

Mr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties. Although Mr. Epstein appeared

6

Page 980

to cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother. Indeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, power, and association with other high-profile individuals. [B)(7)(A)

In the weeks before his death, he made statements that he was “a coward” and was having difficulty adapting to his diminished circumstances. He also frequently referenced poor sleep and an inability to tolerate the noise of prison. On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were unsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some of his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status in both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in prison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.

The following recommendations concern institution operations:

1. Single Celling: [B)(8)

2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2019.

In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019, [B)(8); (B)(7)(C) sent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scott, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between [B)(8); (B)(7)(C) and [B)(8); (B)(7)(C) National Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [B)(8); (B)(7)(C)

7

Page 981

reviewed the consult and recommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another inmate who had also been accused of committing a sex offense. There is no evidence this information was considered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a sexual offense.

Although the incident report was later expunged, inmates frequently experience significant stress when they contemplate the potential consequences associated with findings of guilt.

entered a Psychology Services Intake Screening into PDS-BEMR on July 8, 2010. The document has three typographical errors. She selected the No Sexual Offense Convictions check box when, in fact, Mr. Epstein was previously convicted of Solicitation of Prostitution and Procuring a Person Under the Age of 18 for Prostitution. Second, Mr. Epstein was erroneously identified as a Black male in this document. Finally, there is one instance where he was mistakenly referred to as

Page 982

☐ completed a Risk of Sexual Abusiveness document on July 8, 2019. She marked “History of prior prison sexual predation” in the affirmative. This is not accurate.

☐ Mid-Level Practitioner, completed a History and Physical on July 9, 2019. An Intake Screening should have been conducted within 24 hours of his entry into Bureau custody which was on July 6, 2019, according to P6031.04, Patient Care.

Officer [☐] was responsible for observing Mr. Epstein and documenting his behavior while on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. Officer [☐] mistakenly used a Suicide Watch Log Book intended for inmate companion documentation between 1:40 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on July 23, 2019, when he should have been using the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. [☐] Drug Treatment Specialist, reportedly noticed this error and subsequently hand copied all of Officer [☐] entries from 1:40 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. into a Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. She then initialed these entries, and this makes it appear as if she was the one conducting the watch. This information was discovered and conveyed in an e-mail from Ms. Charisma Edge, Associate Warden to [☐] with a carbon copy to Warden N’Diaye on August 12, 2019. Of note, [☐] did not make an entry explaining why she was making the log book changes. Additionally, [☐] then wrote entries for 6:15, 6:30, 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. in the Staff Suicide Watch Log Book. These were not a part of the original entries made by Officer [☐] nor was [☐] assigned to work the Suicide Watch post. Due to the inability to interview staff at this time, it is unknown why [☐] attempted to correct Officer [☐] error, or made any of the subsequent log entries. It is recommended that if a staff member makes an entry error (e.g., writes in the incorrect suicide watch log book), the staff member should describe the error in the correct log book, to include indicating when they became aware of the error. The staff member should then notify the Chief Psychologist.

A review of Special Housing Unit Records (BP-A0292) revealed a number of incomplete entries. This document is used to monitor provision and receipt of basic services such as recreation, medical rounds, showers, meal consumption, etc. The Officer in Charge signature is missing on 10 occasions and a medical provider’s signature is missing in seven instances. There are six instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein ate his meal. There are nine instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein took a shower. There are ten instances in which it is not clear if Mr. Epstein was offered recreation. P5500.15, Correctional Services Manual requires accurate and complete information on the BP-A0292.

A review of Psychology Observation Log Books revealed significant discrepancies from the approved Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum, dated April 15, 2019. A Correctional Officer is required to complete hourly rounds and sign the log book; 179

9

Page 983

out of 183 round signatures were missing. The lieutenant is required to sign the log book one time per shift and signatures were missing in 10 of 23 instances. A Physician Assistant is required to sign one time per shift and 16 of 16 instances were missing.

5. **Telephone Calls**: In a PDS-BEMR note written by on July 16, 2019, she was informed by an unnamed staff member that a lieutenant facilitated two telephone calls for Mr. Epstein. It is unknown when and to whom these calls were placed and no evidence that they took place on a monitored telephone.

According to a memorandum from Unit Manager on August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein terminated his legal visit early on August 9, 2019, in order to place a telephone call to his family. (who was the Institutional Duty Officer that week) escorted Mr. Epstein to SHU around 7:00 p.m. that evening and he was placed in the shower area on G tier. While there, he was provided the telephone to make a call. Since Mr. Epstein reportedly did not have his PAC or PIN number, which is required to use the inmate telephone system, the Unit Manager placed the call, dialing a number that reportedly began with area code 347. Mr. Epstein told he was calling his mother who, according to public records, has been deceased since 2004.

6. **Direct Observation**: Mr. Epstein was on suicide watch from July 23, 2019, until July 24, 2019. While on suicide watch on July 23, 2019, Mr. Epstein attended an attorney visit from approximately 12:40 p.m. until 7:15 p.m. During this time, he was without “direct, continuous observation” by a dedicated BOP staff member as required by P5324.08. While on Psychological Observation, he attended attorney visits on July 24, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 25, 2019, for 11.25 hours; on July 26, 2019, for 9.25 hours; on July 27, 2019, for 11.33 hours; on July 28, 2019, for 10.5 hours; and on July 29, 2019, for 8 hours. On July 30, 2019, Psychology Observation was terminated. During these visits, continuous observation by a dedicated BOP staff member was not maintained as required by MCC New York’s Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation.

7. **Follow-Up**: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m. institution count that evening Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-mail she sent to Drs. and and Lieutenant later that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as “distraught, sad and a little confused.” She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was

10

Page 984

okay, and he reportedly said he was. However, [8081: d0172C] noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, “He seems dazed and withdrawn.” She went on to say, “So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him.” Despite the fact that Lieutenant [8081: d0172C] opened the e-mail there is no evidence that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Additionally, if [8081: d0172C] was concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*, requires her to maintain direct, continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When [8081: d0172C] opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr. Epstein was evaluated by [8081: d0172C] at approximately 9:30 a.m.

Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this. Specifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.” Furthermore, P5324.07, *SENTRY Psychology Alert Function* states, “When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.” [8081: d0172C]

Both of these groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through the media).

Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) provided R&amp;D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice indicated Mr. Epstein had “MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.” The USMS requested R&amp;D staff sign the form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m. [8081: d0172C] sent [8081: d0172C] an e-mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, *Suicide Prevention Program*. Specifically, when a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,

11

Page 985

continuous observation until he is placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by [EUR1:0172C] for a suicide risk assessment on August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.

8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy: According to a SENTRY quarters roster generated on August 10, 2019, at 12:51 a.m., there were three inmates assigned to Mr. Epstein’s SHU cell, Z04-206LAD, including him, at the time of his death. However, his SHU cell was only a double occupancy cell. Inmate [EUR1:0172C] inmate [EUR1:0172C] and Mr. Epstein were all assigned to the same cell. On August 13, 2019, at 12:06 p.m. and 12:08 p.m., a quarters history roster was generated for inmate [EUR1:0172C] and [EUR1:0172C] respectively. Inmate [EUR1:0172C] cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from August 5, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-212UAD. Inmate [EUR1:0172C] cell assignment was Z04-206UAD from August 1, 2019, until August 11, 2019, when he was moved to cell Z04-207LAD. A quarters history roster was generated for Mr. Epstein on August 13, 2019, at 9:07 a.m. His cell assignment was Z04-206LAD from July 29, 2019, until August 10, 2019.

On Monday, August 12, 2019, photographs of nametags on SHU cell doors and SHU locator forms were sent to the Correctional Service Department in the Northeast Region. The SHU locator form is dated August 9, 2019. It shows inmate [EUR1:0172C] in cell 207L (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate [EUR1:0172C] in cell 212U (SENTRY states he was moved to this cell on August 11, 2019), inmate Epstein in cell 220L (SENTRY never shows him in this cell) along with inmate Reyes (#85993-054). The locator shows inmate [EUR1:0172C] and inmate [EUR1:0172C] in cell 206. The photo sheets show the cell being 220 with inmates Epstein and Reyes’ identification cards on the door. Inmate Reyes, Efrain, Reg. No. 85993-054 was in cell Z06-220U from August 5, 2019 to August 9, 2019.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code H01 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first revealed Mr. Epstein was in H01-001L according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells. SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to H01-001L, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four H01 cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.

12

Page 986

Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional Service Procedures Manual.

9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death. Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

10. Automatic External Defibrillators: A review of available AEDs in the institution revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and incomplete.

11. Post Orders &amp; SHU Training: SHU Post Orders Sign-In Sheets were reviewed for the 3rd Quarter, spanning June 9, 2019, to September 7, 2019. Office [kids; dist7;sci] failed to sign post orders for SHU #3 post.

Quarterly SHU Training Sign-In Sheets were reviewed. The 2019 3rd Quarter SHU Training was conducted on June 6, 2019. Three staff assigned to the 3rd Quarter SHU Roster in SHU did not attend or receive the SHU Training: Officer [kids; dist7;sci] Officer [kids; dist7;sci] and Officer [kids; dist7;sci]

12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing

13

Page 987

the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory psychologist to provide critical clinical services.

Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.

13. **Sex Offense Risk Factors**: A broad understanding of risk factors associated with sex offenders, by staff at MCC New York, did not appear to be present in all staff but was vital to his adjustment and safety in prison.

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and email me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less than 100 yards apart from each other.

If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with [Scrib] (0x7xC) Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pretrial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&amp;D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

WAIVER/NOTICE OF SEPARATION
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS

## I. INSTRUCTIONS

The staff member conducting intake screening shall advise the pretrial inmate, depending upon the design, structure, and operation of the individual institution, that the inmate may have contact with convicted inmates. The inmate is to be asked to sign the appropriate portion in Section II of this Pretrial Inmate Work Waiver/Notice of Separation. If the inmate refuses to sign this segment of the form, staff shall document this refusal on the form.

A pretrial inmate who wishes to waive the exemption from work must sign the appropriate portion in Section IV of this Pretrial Inmate Work Waiver/Notice of Separation. This form must be completed prior to the issuance of a work assignment. If the inmate’s behavior suggests an inability to comprehend the waiver, or if the inmate has been admitted to a mental health referral for evaluation or treatment, the inmate must be referred to a mental health professional for an assessment as to competency to sign the waiver. The waiver may be rescinded at the inmate’s request and reasons for the rescission should be documented in Section V of this form and signed by a staff member. The waiver shall be maintained in the inmate’s unit file or record office file and will remain in the file as a permanent document. The inmate may be given a copy of this form if the inmate so requests.

## II. NOTICE OF SEPARATION

A. I understand that it is possible that I will have contact with inmates already convicted of a crime. I am/am not (circle one) aware of any reason why my having contact with convicted prisoners would pose a threat to my safety or the safety of others.

## III. POLICY

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by 8081; 00172C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate 8081; 00172C)

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

I hereby acknowledge that I have been advised of the above rights afforded me at a hearing before the Discipline Hearing Officer. I have further been advised that if I have previously received either a presumptive or effective parole date from the Parole Commission, a finding by the DHO that I committed the prohibited act(s) may result in a rescission or retardation by the Parole Commission of the presumptive or effective parole date.

|  Inmate Name: | EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD |   |   |   |   | Reg #: | 76318-054  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Date of Birth: | 01/20/1953 | Sex: | M | Facility: | NYM | Unit Team: | 5  |
|  Date: | 07/30/2019 12:01 | Provider: | Sp8; (b37)C | PsyD |  |  |   |

## Reason for Referral and Identifying Information

Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manager [sp8; (b37)C] for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555.

## Background Information

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by [sp8; (b37)C] "Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time."

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by [sp8; (b37)C] "Inmate Epstein denied any past or present suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the past."

[b37]A

## Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam

[b37]A

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.

## Clinical Impression

According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by [sp8; (b37)C] "No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current."

## Findings

The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent.

## Recommendations Regarding Sanctions

In the case of inmate Epstein, after a review of available psychological and psychiatric records as well as information pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is:

- (X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process.
- ( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for an updated competency assessment in 30 days.
- ( ) NOT COMPETENT and not likely to become competent.

[kids: 00/72C] this looks like an outstanding report. Its unbelievable all you report without the benefit of interviews or video, and it raises significant concerns. After you get feedback, please send me a final draft. Please mark it as draft so I can give to the director as a draft. She is considering asking you to label this as an interim report in light of the limited ability to do interviews. But she can decide once she sees this report. Thanks again.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [808; d073C] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [808; d073C]

[808; d073C] His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Good morning
[80(6); (80(7))C]

My apologies, but I have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. I received your voicemails regarding the status of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family as expeditiously as possible.

If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to chat further.

Thank you,

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with (8045; 0072G) Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pretrial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&amp;D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less than 100 yards apart from each other.

If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

Do you have the results of his autopsy?

See attached reconstructed SROs.

&gt;&gt;8/13/2019 11:36 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;

I attached 2 copies of Epstein SRO reviews:

1. Epstein76318-054_SRO_20190710-20190723.pdf (confined in SHU 7/10/2019 - 7/23/2019), and
2. Epstein76318-054_SRO_20190729-20190810.pdf (confined in SHU 7/29/2019 - 8/10/2019)

Because the first confinement, Epstein was held only 2 days in SHU (7/7/2019 - 7/8/2019), NYM did not review Epstein.

Thanks,

&gt;&gt;8/12/2019 12:40 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;

Please do it. We need it tomorrow morning at the latest.

SRO review data is stored in DREV table. But SHU generates SRO review for inmates are currently in Z house. I need to write some code to get around to get the SRO reports for Epstein.

&gt;&gt; b)(6): (b)(7)(C) 8/12/2019 12:20 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;

b)(6): (b)(7)(C) these are good. Thanks. Also, need any data you can get for SROs (SHU reviews). Apparently since he was "notorious" he should have had more frequent reviews. Do we have any data indicating the SRO?

&gt;&gt; b)(6): (b)(7)(C) 8/12/2019 11:37 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;

b)(6): (b)(7)(C)

I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 times.

I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

Thanks,

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and email me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Thanks.

BP-S293.052 INMATE RIGHTS AT DISCIPLINE HEARING CDFRM

MAY 94

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS

# Institution:

As an inmate charged with a violation of Bureau of Prisons rules or regulations referred to the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) for disposition, you have the following rights:

1. The right to have a written copy of the charge(s) against you at least 24 hours prior to appearing before the Discipline Hearing Officer;
2. The right to have a full-time member of the staff who is reasonably available to represent you before the Discipline Hearing Officer;
3. The right to call witnesses (or present written statements of unavailable witnesses) and to present documentary evidence in your behalf, provided institutional safety would not be jeopardized;
4. The right to present a statement or to remain silent. Your silence may be used to draw an adverse inference against you. However, your silence alone may not be used to support a finding that you committed a prohibited act;
5. The right to be present throughout the discipline hearing except during a period of deliberation or when institutional safety would be jeopardized. If you elect not to appear before the DHO, you may still have witnesses and a staff representative appear on your behalf;
6. The right to be advised of the DHO's decision, the facts supporting that decision, except where institutional safety would be jeopardized, and the DHO's disposition in writing; and,
7. The right to appeal the decision of the DHO by means of the Administrative Remedy Procedure to the Regional Director within 20 calendar days of notice of the DHO's decision and disposition.

I hereby acknowledge that I have been advised of the above rights afforded me at a hearing before the Discipline Hearing Officer. I have further been advised that if I have previously received either a presumptive or effective parole date from the Parole Commission, a finding by the DHO that I committed the prohibited act(s) may result in a rescission or retardation by the Parole Commission of the presumptive or effective parole date.

# Institution Disciplinary Process Report

|  Inmate Name: | EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD |   |   |   |   | Reg #: | 76318-054  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Date of Birth: | 01/20/1953 | Sex: | M | Facility: | NYM | Unit Team: | 5  |
|  Date: | 07/30/2019 12:01 | Provider: | Bb981(b)(7)(C) | PsyD |  |  |   |

# Reason for Referral and Identifying Information

Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manage for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555.

# Background Information

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by "Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time."

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by "Inmate Epstein denied any past or present suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the past."

# Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam

# Current Mental Status

He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.

# Clinical Impression

According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by "No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current."

# Findings

The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent.

# Recommendations Regarding Sanctions

In the case of inmate Epstein, after a review of available psychological and psychiatric records as well as information pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is:

(X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process.
( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for an updated competency assessment in 30 days.
( ) NOT COMPETENT and not likely to become competent.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by 80/81; 81/72C) Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate 80/81; 81/72C)

his case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pretrial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&amp;D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [bvk; dct7xC] Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [bvk; dct7xC]

his case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Hello,

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney. I will provide you with information concerning the medical assessment, once I receive it. Thanks.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and email me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.

"This writer consulted with Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pretrial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&amp;D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less than 100 yards apart from each other.

If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you

I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 times.

I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

Thanks,

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-mail me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Thanks.

I made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert. Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is between you and them and not my business.

Hugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.

Is there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29th after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day until 6:45

Page 3489

Page 1231

p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on PSYCH Alert as well as a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his cell on August 9th.

On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks required to be performed were actually done.

On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29th Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at MCC-New York after daily interaction with him and according to his own plan.

On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from the institution.

On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that the institution is still on the list.

On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR.

Questions &amp; Proposed Responses:

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against
I've spoken to an AFG
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?
(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?
(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?
(4) Is it correct that were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?
(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's a public)
(6) Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges? What's the message to overworked, disgruntled

I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 times.
I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and email me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

See attached reconstructed SROs.

&gt;&gt; 8/13/2019 11:36 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;

I attached 2 copies of Epstein SRO reviews:
1. Epstein 76318-054_SRO_20190710-20190723.pdf (confined in SHU 7/10/2019 - 7/23/2019), and

Because the first confinement, Epstein was held only 2 days in SHU (7/7/2019 - 7/8/2019), NYM did not review Epstein.

Thanks,

SRO review data is stored in DREV table. But SHU generates SRO review for inmates are currently in Z house. I need to write some code to get around to get the SRO reports for Epstein.

these are good. Thanks. Also, need any data you can get for SROs (SHU reviews). Apparently since he was "notorious" he should have had more frequent reviews. Do we have any data indicating the SRO?

I made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert. Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is between you and them and not my business.

Hugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.

Is there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29th after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day until 6:45

Page 3815

Page 1270

p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on PSYCH Alert as well as a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his cell on August 9th.

On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks required to be performed were actually done.

On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.

Reporter:

Questions &amp; Proposed Responses:

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against [dot#: (dot7xC)] I've spoken to an AFGE union official and [dot#: (dot7xC)] defense attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today.

Page 3823

Page 1273

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein’s suicide?

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

(4) Is it correct that [x16; x17] were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What’s the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it’s available.)

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Page 1274

(6) Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges? What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

Hello @jdb; doi7x6&gt;

is talking with BOP's Acting Director now, and Budget Staff has been directed to ask BOP the following questions regarding Jeffrey Epstein with immediate turnaround requested. Please provide responses to all of the following questions by 4:00 pm today:

1. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-Board employee numbers for MCC New York?
2. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York?
3. How many Correctional Officers were absent for any reason (did not show for work) on Friday 8/09 at MCC New York? How many Correctional Officers were absent for any reason on Saturday 8/10?
a. Can this be broken down for the overnight shift between Friday and Saturday?
4. To what extent was MCC New York utilizing recruitment and retention bonuses?
5. Did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions from BOP, and if so, were they provided?
6. Of the two correctional officers patrolling that unit, how many were Correctional Officers in the traditional sense (0007 series)? Was either of the employees an "augmented" staffperson?
7. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages?
8. At MCC New York, are correctional officers who perform overtime generally performing voluntary overtime, or are they generally performing mandated overtime?
9. Provide the "bid sheet" for overtime for Friday night 8/09 at MCC New York.
10. Provide report of MCC New York inmates by week for the previous five years.
11. We believe that MCC New York had 19 vacant positions and was recruiting 41 candidates. Please confirm whether this is accurate.

Please provide as much information as is available by 4:00pm; we understand this is a very short turnaround. Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Here is a very rough draft for you and your staff to enhance if possible very quickly today. I can then run by [date: 2019/12/06] and my boss before I answer the reporter. Feel free to tell me if I've said more below from our conversation than may be appropriate to share with media.

Thanks,

# Questions &amp; Proposed Responses:

Hello, I’m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against [date: 2019/12/06]. I’ve spoken to an AFGE union official and [date: 2019/12/06] defense attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?
[date]

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?
[date]

(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein’s suicide?
[date]

Page 1292

(4) Is it correct that [B)(6); (b)(7)(C)] were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?

(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.)

(6) Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges? What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

[02/01/2019] I made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert. Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is between you and them and not my business.

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29th after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day until 6:45

p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on PSYCH Alert as well as a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his cell on August 9th.

On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks required to be performed were actually done.

On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.
