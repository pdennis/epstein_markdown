Federal Universal Service Charge Increase

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently announced an increase in the factor that determines how much BellSouth contributes to the Federal Universal Service Funds. These funds are designed to help keep telephone rates affordable and to expand telephone services to schools and rural areas. You will see a corresponding increase in the Federal Universal Service monthly charge that recovers this increased payment by BellSouth. The increase will be effective April 1, 2005, and will be reflected on April and May 2005 bills. This charge will not be applied to Lifeline accounts.

RE: Freedom of Information Request
Jeffrey Epstein Case
Case Number 2005CF009454A

Dear Ms. Belohlavek:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney’s Office and pending there ever since.

I understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an “active investigation”, yet all notices related to hearings on this case, or the dates, time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to postpone, cancel or change is done “orally” I was informed that the file in your office has no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January 4, 2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings.

I respectfully request that I be informed of the the hearing dates related to this case. If the hearing date is changed “orally” I respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office that hearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request.

Thank you.

TO: Mr. Guy Lewis
RE: Mr. Epstein
FROM: Aileen Josephs, Esq.

Mr. Lewis:

Women in our County have been watching this case with great concern. I strongly suggest you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel that your client has been defamed, as you mentioned in the February 7, 2008 Palm Beach Post article, you can file a libel suit- of course, the truth is an absolute defense to libel and please keep in mind that not knowing the age of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime committed against a child.

Sincerely,

Aileen Josephs, Esq.

**Cite History:**
This investigation was initiated on 10/24/05 upon receipt of a call from Stacey Taylor. Co Manager who stated that an incident occurred on Friday October 21st 2005.

**Involving:** CSt. Hall came to work at 1:30pm on 10/21/05, dressed in hot work attire carrying her purse and a Journey's plastic bag, containing what looked like a box of shoes. Hall then stated that she was going in the mall to return a pair of shoes and she would return for her scheduled shift at 2pm. At approximately 2:45 pm, Hall was at the store, speaking on the phone and she was wearing a new pair of shoes. She sounded frustrated so when she finished with her call, she continued to explain that she had called Journey's customer service line because during her visit to the shoe store two men working there had "harassed" her and had made indirect comments stating that "stealing was bad" and that their service towards her was very poor. According to her, after finishing the return, one of the men followed her after leaving the store as she made her way back to work. At approximately 3:10pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out a name. The man never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few moments later she walked back startled, saying that the man who had come in the store was the manager at Journey's, and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes she had returned, claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid to late 20's came in and requested to speak to Alex. Hall went in the front of the store and spoke to the woman, who then became rather upset. He stated that the woman who claims she stole her shoes was at the store and the lady was screaming at . The woman began to explain to Stacey Taylor that a week ago she lost a pair of shoes in the mall (Doc Marten shoes for men size 11 1/2) and that she had called the stores she visited that day, including VSS, and was told that no one had found them. She accused of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt.

which contained her credit card number. The lady left the store very upset. A mail security officer named Baltizar, came in the store looking for and she began explaining to him that her father had sent some shoes to her boyfriend and that they didn't fit so he gave them to her to return so she could purchase something that she wanted. The mail officer asked her how she had gotten that receipt and she said that her boyfriend gave her the bag of shoes with that receipt inside and she had no idea how this had happened. Soon after, Baltizar left and another Mail Officer came into the store in his mid 20's, black, and large built. She began explaining that her boyfriend had bought shoes for her father and that they didn't fit so he asked her to return them so she could purchase anything she wanted thereby changing her original story. The questioning continued on for about 5 more minutes and she was then told by the officer that all the women wanted was to get her merchandise back. Asked the officer what she should do to get the women's merchandise back and that she just wanted this to "go away" and that "she didn't care about her shoes and she would return them" in order to retrieve the merchandise for the woman. The mail officer escorted her out of the store and a female mail officer, Baptizar, the woman who made the allegations and the manager of Journeys returned to Journeys. He was not wearing the shoes she had earlier and after the mail officer left. Asked Taylor not to tell Veronica, SM what had happened.

Update: October 28th, 2005: At approximately 4:15pm, she was leaving the store and Christina Orpiano, CM, was traveling down on the floor digging through her purse.

rough times
Current mood: ☐ sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank God she has me. I hope everything ends up being okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. There's been so much death around me. It's really overwhelming.

Freedom!!!
Current mood: ☐ drained

Hey,

Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! For all of you who are not aware, I moved to Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will and I are getting along. Not like everyone predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of that time together will be horrible,..." the complete opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores and Bath &amp; Body Works. I like my boss so far, I mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. The boss guy called him back to set up an interview the day he came in with the application, I think that's a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a lil' while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS job and the lady called me back and told me that William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence that she didn't need to call anyone else back,...he got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound fucking great...I lied and said that he was the old stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

I am sooooooooooooooo tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was sooooooooo cool! There was 400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.

**GGGRRRRRR,...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
**Current mood: ☐ pissed off**

I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$. I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!!

You are Lou Dog. The beloved pet of Brad. It has been said that you are like the "alter ego" of Brad, and were like his best friend. You have just recently passed on. RIP Lou Dog 1978-2001
