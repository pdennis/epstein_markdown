Summary:
On 11/4/05 RLPM Colon Interviewed / who admitted to merchandise theft totaling $209.00. Information was reviewed with Ronnie Lomax, DM and Veronica Montanez, SM and Hall resigned immediately at the conclusion of the interview.

Considerations:
This investigation was initiated on 10/24/05 upon receipt of a call from Stacey Taylor, Co Manager who stated that an incident occurred on Friday October 21st 2005.
Involving / CSL came to work at 1:30pm on 10/21/05, dressed in her work attire carrying her purse and a Journey's plastic bag, containing what looked like a box of shoes. Then stated that she was going in the mall to return a pair of shoes and she would return for her scheduled shift at 2pm.
At approximately 2:45 pm, was at the store, speaking on the phone and she was wearing a new pair of shoes. She sounded frustrated so when she finished with her call, she continued to explain that she had called Journey's customer service line because during her visit to the shoe store two men working there had "harassed" her and had made indirect comments stating that "stealing was bad" and that their service towards her was very poor.
According to her, after finishing the return, one of the men followed her after leaving the store as she made her way back to work. At approximately 3:10pm, a man came to the front of the store and called out a name. The man never came in the store, but stood directly in front without ever crossing the carpeted area. They talked for few minutes and he showed her a piece of paper that looked like a receipt. A few moments later she walked back, startled, saying that the man who had came in the store was the manager at Journey's, and that he had accused her of stealing the shoes she had returned, claiming that the shoes belonged to someone else. Soon after she came back on the sales floor and a woman in her mid to late 20's came in and requested to speak to.
The woman began to explain to Stacey Taylor that a week ago she lost a pair of shoes in the mall (Doc Marten shoes for men size 11 1/2) and that she had called the stores she visited that day, including VSS, and was told that no one had found them. She accused of stealing the shoes and returning them for something suitable for herself, with the original receipt

Damn... I just read about your near fatal accident. Glad you're alright and unscaved. It's close calls like that that make us thank god. I'm not very religious myself, but try and do the right thing. I was driving down south once on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped over on us so I know how you feel. The least that driver could have done was stopped, but at least you didn't hit anything and are OK.  |

Will looks so damn ridiculous in this picture. He looks like he got hit in the back of the head with a shovel, and now he's retarded. So the only place he can work is Wal-Mart. Or maybe he's just high.

Biker Bitch
Current mood: ☐ exhausted
Category: Automotive

I am sooooooooooooooo tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was sooooooooo cool! There was 400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

BUMMER MAN
Current mood: ☐ crushed
Category: School, College, Greek

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for FSU on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.

GGGRRRRRR,...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$. I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!!!!

rough times

Current mood: ☐ sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank God she has me. I hope everything ends up being okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. There's been so much death around me. It's really overwhelming.

Hey,

Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! For all of you who are not aware, I moved to Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will and I are getting along. Not like everyone predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of that time together will be horrible,..." the complete opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores and Bath &amp; Body Works. I like my boss so far, I mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. The boss guy called him back to set up an interview the day he came in with the application, I think that's a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a lil' while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS job and the lady called me back and told me that William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence that she didn't need to call anyone else back,...he got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound fucking great,...I lied and said that he was the old stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.

I'm pretty laid back. I go with the fl things. I miss my friends back home but I know move on; If I don't, then how am I supposed love my friends and I love my family. And Will my life.
