W S C THE PALM BEACH POST • TUESDAY, AUGUST 8, 2006 98

# Attorney: Police gave media ‘distorted view’

## EPSTEIN from 1B

They did that Monday via Goldberger and a Los Angeles publicist for Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, who also has represented Epstein in the case.

“We just think there has been a distorted view of this case in the media presented by the Palm Beach police,” Goldberger said.

Reiter has consistently declined to comment on the case and did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

The implication that State Attorney Barry Krischer was easy on Epstein by presenting the case to a grand jury rather than filing charges directly against him is wrong, Goldberger said.

The Palm Beach Police Department was “happy and ecstatic” that the panel was going to review the evidence. “I think what happened is they weren’t happy with the result. They decided to use the press to embarrass Mr. Epstein.”

But records show that Reiter wrote Krischer on May 1 — well before the case went to the grand jury — suggesting that Krischer “consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.”

Rather than flat-out decline to charge Epstein, Krischer referred the case to the grand jury to “appease” the chief, Goldberger said.

A state attorney’s spokesman would say only that the office refers cases to the grand jury when there are issues with the viability of the evidence or witnesses’ credibility.

Both the state attorney and the grand jury concluded there was not sufficient evidence that Epstein had sex with minors, according to Goldberger. “It was just a childish performance by the Palm Beach Police Department,” Goldberger said.

The defense attorney said one of the alleged victims who claimed she was a minor was in fact over the age of 18. Another alleged victim who was subpoenaed to testify to the grand jury failed to do so. Epstein’s accusers, he added, have histories of drug abuse and thefts. “These women are liars. We’ve established that.”

But why would they all invent their stories about meeting Epstein for sexual massages?

“I don’t have an answer as to what was the motivation for these women to come forward and make these allegations,” Goldberger said.

# Indictment: Billionaire solicited 3 times

Palm Beach police will report today about their prostitution probe of the money manager.

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Billionaire money manager and Palm Beach part-time resident Jeffrey Epstein solicited or procured prostitutes three or more times between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31 of last year, according to an indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution.

Epstein, 53, was booked at the Palm Beach County jail at 1:45 a.m. Sunday. He was released on $3,000 bond.

Epstein's case is unusual in that suspected prostitution johns are usually charged with a misdemeanor, and even a felony charge is typically made in a criminal information — an alternative to an indictment charging a person with

the commission of a crime.

His attorney, Jack Goldberger, declined to discuss the charge.

State attorney's office spokesman Mike Edmondson also had little to say.

"Generally speaking, there is a case that has a number of different aspects to it," Edmondson said of a prostitution-related charge being submitted to a grand jury. "We first became aware of the case months ago by Palm Beach police."

Prosecutors and police worked together to bring the case to the grand jury, he said.

Palm Beach police confirmed that and said the department will release a report today regarding its investigation.

Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7½-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a pool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal

Waterway since 1990, according to property records. A man answering the door there Monday said that Epstein wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade registered to him was parked in the driveway, which is flanked by two massive gargoyles.

Epstein sued Property Appraiser Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that the assessment of his home exceeded its fair market value. He dismissed his lawsuit in December 2002.

A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair magazine said he owns what are believed to be the largest private homes in Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch. Those are in addition to his 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet of aircraft.

Epstein's friends and admirers, according to the magazine, include prominent businessmen, academics and scientists and famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.

# Mystery money man faces soliciting charge

By NICOLE JANOK
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

A part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed early Sunday with accused drug dealers, drunken drivers and wife beaters after he was charged with soliciting a prostitute.

Manhattan money manager Jeffrey Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was released hours later on $3,000 bond.

Epstein was indicted last week by a state grand jury, according to state attorney's spokesman Mike Edmondson. Despite Epstein's arrest, the indictment containing the allegations remained sealed Sunday and Edmondson provided no details.

Unlike most accused Johns, Epstein was charged with a third-degree felony instead of a misdemeanor. Under state law, a solicitation charge usually is elevated to a more-serious felony when the defendant has at least two solicitation convictions.

However, checks of court records here and in New York Sunday turned up no such convictions.

Epstein could not be reached. Edmondson said he was being represented by West Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberg, who declined comment.

Epstein is the president of J Epstein &amp; Co., a money management company based in Manhattan that caters to ultra-wealthy clientele, according to pub

'Mysterious billionaire' has been on probation

► SOLICITING from 1B

Solicitants have described him as a "mysterious billionaire" who lives in a 45,000-square-foot New York City mansion.

He has been in trouble before. In 1993, he and two other defendants were charged in federal court with three counts of postal larceny and theft and one count of property theft. Epstein plead guilty to a single charge of conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks from residential mailboxes and received 5 years' probation. The remaining charges were dropped.

Since then, Epstein's name has turned in New York City's tables. The New York Post noted flew President Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa his private Boeing 721-2003, the paper dubbed lone of the Big Apple's "touds."

In 2004, Stein bid against Trump, a 43,000-square-foot 120th-Second-State once-own healthcare-magnat Gossman. Trump toppetein with a $41.35 million.

# CORRECTIONS &amp; CLARIFICATIONS

Because of reporting errors, *The Palm Beach Post* Monday said that Jeffrey Epstein, a part-time Palm Beach resident, pleaded guilty in 1993 to a charge of conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks. That was another Jeffrey Epstein, not the one indicted here on a prostitution solicitation charge. Jeffrey Epstein of Palm Beach has never been charged with postal larceny and theft of U.S. Treasury checks, has never pleaded guilty and has never been on probation. The story also incorrectly said that Epstein was arrested Sunday at his Palm Beach home. He surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail, according to his attorney, Jack Goldberger. Goldberger’s name also was misspelled in the article. The story appeared on the front page of the Local section.

Epstein, 53, was in lled by a county grand last month on a charge elony solicitation of prostitution. After an 11-month investigation that included sifting through Epstein's trash and surveilling his home, Palm Beach police concluded there was enough evidence to charge him with sexual activity with minors. When the grand jury indicted Epstein on the less serious

charge, Police Chief Michael Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether there were federal law violations.

After a spate of stories about the case last week, New York publicist Dan Klores - whose client list has included Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez - said on Saturday that Epstein's camp was ready "to get their story out."

suggesting the county's top prosecutor disqualify himself.

"I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases," Reiter wrote in a May 1 memo to Krischer.

While not commenting specifically on the Epstein case, Mike Edmondson, spokesman for the state attorney, said his office presents cases other than murders to a grand jury when there are questions about witnesses' credibility and their ability to testify.

By the nature of their jobs, police officers look at evidence from a "one-sided perspective," Edmondson said. "A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," weighing the veracity of witnesses and how they may fare under defense attorneys' questioning, he said.

Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger, said his client committed no crimes.

"The reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney questioned the credibility of the witnesses," Goldberger said. A county grand jury "found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible," and that's why his client was not charged with sexual activity with minors, he said.

Goldberger said Epstein passed a lie detector test administered by a reputable polygraph examiner in which he said he did not know the girls were minors. Also, a search warrant served on Epstein's home found no evidence to corroborate the girls' allegations, Goldberger said.

According to police documents:

- A Palm Beach Community College student said she gave Epstein a massage in the nude, then brought him six girls, ages 14 to 16, for massage and sex-tinged sessions at his home.

- A 27-year-old woman who worked as Epstein's personal assistant also facilitated the liaisons, phoning the PBCC student to arrange for girls when Epstein was coming to town. And she escorted the girls upstairs when they arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing massage oils nearby.

- Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. They contend that on three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls.

## The chief's letter

See the letter Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote to State Attorney Barry Krischer on the Epstein case. PalmBeachPost.com

A money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors in 2003 by The New York Post. He reportedly hobnobs with the likes of former President Clinton, former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.

He has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, including Sen. John Kerry's presidential bid, and the Senate campaigns of Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer.

Goldberger is one of five attorneys Epstein has retained since he became the subject of an investigation, Edmondson said. Among the others: Alan Dershowitz, the well-known Harvard law professor and author, who is a friend of Epstein. Dershowitz could not be reached for comment.

Police said the woman who enlisted young girls for Epstein was Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach. Robson has worked at an Olive Garden restaurant in Wellington and said she was a journalism major at Palm Beach Community College when she was questioned by police last October. She has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment.

Robson said she met Epstein when, at age 17, a friend asked her if she would like to make money giving him a massage. She said she was driven to his five-bedroom, 7½-bath home on the Intracoastal Waterway, then escorted upstairs to a bedroom with a massage table and oils. Epstein and Robson were both naked during the massage, she said, but when he grabbed her buttocks, she said she didn't want to be touched.

Epstein said he'd pay her to bring him more girls — the younger the better, Robson told police. When she tried once to bring a 23-year-old woman to him, Epstein said she was too old, Robson said.

Robson, who has not been charged in the case, said she eventually brought six girls to Epstein who were paid $200 each time, Robson said. "I'm like a Heidi Fleiss," police quoted her as saying. The girls knew what to expect when they were taken to Epstein's home, Robson said.

Give a massage — maybe naked — and allow some touching.

One 14-year-old girl Robson took to meet Epstein led police to start the investigation of him in March 2005. A relative of the girl called to say she thought the child had recently engaged in sex with a Palm Beach man. The girl then got into a fight with a classmate who accused her of being a prostitute, and she couldn't explain why she had $300 in her purse.

The girl gave police this account of her meeting with Epstein:

- She accompanied Robson and a second girl to Epstein's house on a Sunday in February 2005. Once there, a woman she thought was Epstein's assistant told the girl to follow her upstairs to a room featuring a mural of a naked woman, several photographs of naked women on a shelf, a hot pink and green sofa and a massage table.

She stripped to her bra and panties and gave him a massage.

Epstein gave the 14-year-old $300 and she and the other girls left, she said. She said Robson told her that Epstein paid her $200 that day.

Other girls told similar stories. In most accounts, Epstein's personal assistant at the time, Sarah Kellen, now 27, escorted the girls to Epstein's bedroom.

Kellen, whose most recent known address is in North Carolina, has not been charged in the case.

Palm Beach police often conducted surveillance of Epstein's home, and at Palm Beach International Airport to see if his private jet was there, so they would know when he was in town. Police also arranged repeatedly to receive his trash from Palm Beach sanitation workers, collecting papers with names and phone numbers, sex toys and female hygiene products.

One note stated that a female could not come over at 7 p.m. because of soccer. Another said a girl had to work Sunday — "Monday after school?" And still another note contained the work hours of a girl, saying she leaves school at 11:30 a.m. and would come over the next day at 10:30 a.m.

Only three months before the police department probe began, Epstein donated $90,000 to the department for the purchase of a firearms simulator, said Jane Struder, town finance director. The purchase was never made. The money was returned to Epstein on Monday, she said.

Staff writers Andrew Marra and Tim O'Melita and staff researcher Angelica Cortez contributed to this story.

Women in our County have been watching this case with great concern. I strongly suggest that you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel your client is innocent, you can file a libel suit- of course, the truth is an absolute defense to libel, and please keep in mind that not knowing the age of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime committed against a child.

# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

## Epstein ought to shut up, be happy with 'justice'

I think that Jeffrey Epstein's "camp" should be happy that money and power does buy justice in this county ("Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case," Aug. 14).

The exception: the Rush Limbaugh case. But that was at a time when Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer was running for reelection and was not sure he would run uncontested. He received thousands of e-mails asking him to press charges against Mr. Limbaugh. It was a good political move to do so.

The Epstein camp should stop attacking the victims' reputation in the media. Let's not forget — they are children. A child's reputation is sacred. Also, according to the law, lack of knowledge of the age of the victim is no defense for statutory rape or any sexual crime committed against a child.

If his camp feels that Jeffrey Epstein has been libeled, his high-powered attorneys, Jack Goldberger and Alan Dershowitz, can file a libel suit against the appropriate parties. According to the law, the truth is an absolute defense against libel.

Other than that, the Epstein camp should be silent and content with the justice obtained from the state attorney. Past cases indicate that children's rights, victim's rights and women's rights are meaningless, and often the victim is re-victimized.

## Let commissioners visit Westgate, see good works

I read with interest a recent article in *The Palm Beach Post* regarding the Westgate Tabernacle in West Palm Beach ("Church helps homeless fulfill college dreams," Aug. 18).

I was unaware of the existence of this church or of the problems it reportedly has had with Palm Beach County over code violations. Out of curiosity, I attended a service one morning. I found it a humbling experience. The work this small church is doing to provide real help to the needy, the homeless and other unfortunate citizens is inspiring.

Regardless of whatever problems the church has, I urge all the county commissioners to attend at least one service at this church just to see for themselves the good works it is doing. I think the commissioners will be impressed and gain a new understanding of this organization. It should be encouraged and assisted, not impeded.

# THE TALENTE

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

Unsure the manhattan's Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists the crown jewel of the city's residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge arched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or, rather, commands—the block of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not surprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's largest private residence.

Inside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you feel you have stumbled into someone's private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person's home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.

The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner of Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.

Despite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants to be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he "could never live anywhere bigger." He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like himself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the "leather room," so called because of the cordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling lionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the menservants in white gloves.

Upstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the "office," an enormous gallery spanning the width of the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the "computer room" (a smaller room at the back of the house). Epstein has been known to say. The office features a gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway "D" grand. On the desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade's The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted. Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, "is the largest Persian rug you'll ever see in a private home—so big, it must have come from a mosque." Amid such splendor, much of which reflects the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. "No decorator would ever tell you to do that," Epstein brags to visitors. "But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog." People can't help but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he always has the last word.

In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named "Zorro." "It makes the town house look like a shack," Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman's grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.

Epstein is charming, but he doesn't let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. "You be white. You get the first move." It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no matter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York's moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.

"He's very enigmatic," says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany &amp; Co. in the U.K. and a close friend since the early 1980s. "You think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion skin and there's something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his hand. . . . He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get."

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)

Even acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a "modern maharaja," as Leah Kleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists himself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings or funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like "eating on the subway"—i.e., something he'd never do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom he has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade, Ghislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as simply his "best friend." He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his life—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for him. (Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former associate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva Andersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend "moves up, not down," to friendship status.)

Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon Leon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won't find Epstein's transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. "The trading desks don't seem to know him. It's unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow," says a high-level investment manager.

Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires—who depend on him for discretion. "I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more," he tells people freely. According to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency markets "with very large sums of money," have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today.

Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells people, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding those problems: "Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The key is not to have it do harm more than anything else... You don't want to lose your money."

He has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically, one who specializes in remodeling: "I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as he became wealthier had add-ons. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage ... until you have a house that is usually a mess... It's a large house that has been put together over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs."

He makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer, money manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, myths and rumor swirl around Epstein.

Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn't mind people knowing: He grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city's 07/26/17

parks department. His parents viewed education as "the way out" for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went to Brooklyn's Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a daughter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a limited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said, he wanted to run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in 1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to be accepted by the Establishment. He's a member of various commissions and councils: he is on the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of International Education.

His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Public Records Request No.: 17-295

"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," says Wexner. "But Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and design. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them."

By the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion empire—one that now includes Victoria's Secret, Express, and Bath &amp; Body Works—from $5,000 lent him by his aunt. "Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to realize his [Jeffrey's] dreams," says someone who has worked closely with both men. "He gave Jeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park."

Wexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2 million in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the newlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now owns the house.

Wexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of his private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even persuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner's ailing mother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by splitting the foundation in two.

Epstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He tells people, "I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes even from his own family—then it's often better that people hate me, not the client."

"You've probably heard I'm vicious in my representation of my clients," he tells people proudly; Leah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie *Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome*. Even a former mentor says he's seen "the dark side" of Epstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making a presentation for Wexner as

Larry Summers, Harvard's current president. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says, "I'm on my 20th book... The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey." Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, "He digests and decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings."

Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize winners Gerald Epstein, and he's under the impression that Epstein's clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named "Andrew" in Epstein's house. "Andrew" turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of Dershowitz's law class.

Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner "made him." "I had really rich clients before," he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship. Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. "People have said it's like we have one brain between two of us: each has a side."

being so brutal as to be "irresponsible."

One reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were delivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I don't like the article.

On the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can't say enough nice things: "I have a boy who's dyslexic, and Jeffrey's gotten close to him over the years... Jeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had difficulty... in studying... so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons."

Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down syndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach anytime.

Some friends remember that in the late 80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of good friends by affixing first-class stickers; the only problem was that the stickers turned out to be unofficial. Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn't, and the unwitting recipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades, and had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein's largesse claim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. "I never felt he wanted anything from me in return," says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.

Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he is a familiar face to many of the Victoria's Secret girls. One young woman recalls being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein's town house, where the women seemed to outnumber the men by far. "These were not women you'd see at Upper East Side dinners," the woman recalls. "Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely." This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was filled, she says, with young Russian models. "Some of the guests were horrified," the woman says.

"He's reckless," says a former business associate, "and he's gotten more so. Money does that to you. He's breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he must be in a very difficult place."

According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by Vanity Fair, Epstein may have good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.

When Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious head of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts that people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using company funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion on Long Island, homes on Manhattan's Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and planes.

Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making money. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by Douglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the late attorney general.

Epstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of his apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that he managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent 50 percent of his time helping people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers. He was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed against Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which Epstein put into oil. In 1984, Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the check for $10,000 was for a horse he'd bought from Stroll. "My net worth never exceeded four and a half million dollars," Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, "really liked Jeffrey... Jeffrey has a way of getting under your skin, and he was under Hoffenberg's." Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein's social connections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan Murjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship flourished. "They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg's plane, all around the world, they were always together," says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him, saying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing "illegal operations."

Several of Epstein's Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very suddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical infringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two supporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can't recall this; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. "Jeffrey Epstein left Bear Stearns of his own volition," says Cayne. "It was never suggested that he leave by any member of management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said specifically, 'I don't want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.'" Yet, this is not the story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the S.E.C.'s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein's testimony and that of other Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading around a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe Minerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including Italian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.

After the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at CONTINUED ON PAGE 145

ontains a parody of Affleck and Matt Daron making Good Will Hunting II, Affleck says to Damon, "What do I keep telling you? You gotta do the safe picture, then you do the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta do the payback picture because your friend says you owe him. Then sometimes you gotta do back to the well."

"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games," Damon says derisively.

"That's just mean," Affleck whines.

But it's a pretty accurate description of his career to date. "Ben takes these franchise properties so he can go and experiment," says Harvey Weinstein.

"He believes in trying to stretch himself and not keep doing the same thing," observes Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck in Armageddon. "He's an awesome actor, and I think he's going to do great things."

Several years ago, in a televised interview on Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that his goal was to make big commercial movies. He has since revised his ambitions. "That's an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I think is a towering achievement. I'll continue to act, but I won't act in a way that requires me to hang my name out there and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character roles and focus on writing and directing. It doesn't require the same kinds of sacrifice in terms of quality of life and personal life, and it's a more holistic approach to the process. It's become increasingly frustrating for me to have my role in the storytelling process limited to one character. You have to be respectful and judicious about

your input when it's somebody else's project."

Affleck has always impressed colleagues with his voracious appetite for information and skills. "He has made it a point to learn everything he can about how the business works—not just the craft of acting, but from the producing standpoint, from the studio standpoint," says Jon Gordon, executive vice president of production at Miramax. "He knows how deals work. It's what sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio at some point, he could. He's about as sharp as they come."

Affleck is already juggling his acting with screenwriting and such other commitments as Project Greenlight, the contest he and Damon started to help launch the careers of young filmmakers. Affleck's friends are certain he'll be directing soon. "There's no question," Weinstein says. "Both he and Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll be home runs in both instances."

But there are other thoughts tickling the back of Affleck's mind as well. A passionate liberal, he campaigned for Al Gore, cares deeply about political issues, and is extremely well informed. He entertains himself by writing imaginary political speeches in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS in Africa than his movie career.

When Lopez goes to Affleck's mother's house for dinner, Weinstein reports, "J.Lo told me that the conversation at the table is always about politics—about government initiatives, educational initiatives, what's going on in the day."

So is Affleck planning to become the liberals' answer to Ronald Reagan. He admits that he entertains the thought of someday running for Congress, at least: "I think there's a real nobility to public service. It would be fun to run on a platform I really believed in, without any of the kind of compromises people make—without being beholden in the win-at-all-costs mentality."

And the invasion of privacy would be nothing new. "What are you going to say about me that hasn't already been said? I don't cheat. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I live a clean life," Affleck says, his eyes twinkling.

"He's only 30 years old," says Jennifer Todd, who co-produced Boiler Room. "He still has an enormous amount of time to do things."

Time, and drive. "I think he's incredibly hungry," says Sean Bailey, who founded the media and production company LivePlanet with Affleck, Damon, and Chris Moore. "I think the guy has very grand aspirations. I don't think he's going to be content with just being a movie star. He knows he has the potential to do very big things."

Such ambitions could be derailed by any number of miscalculations, including a private life that generates too many sensational headlines, but Affleck has a clear idea of the ultimate goal. "On my deathbed, I have to be one who looks back and feels I lived a good and substantial and meaningful life," he says.

In the meantime, however, there's a wedding to plan.

# Jeffrey Epstein

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 303 Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he had found "offensive" the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action following its discovery that he had committed a possible "Reg D" violation—evidently he had lent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he'd lent approximately $20,000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered improper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward.

According to Epstein, Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around March 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and

Alvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an "issue" of the matter was Marvin Davidson. On March 9, Epstein said, he had met with Tarnopol and Einbender again, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense, together with previous "carelessness" over expenses, and he would be fined $2,500.

"There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and not myself and I said that it was possible, ... since my secretary handles my expenses," Epstein told the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the "Reg D" incident had cost him a shot at partnership that year.

What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection between Epstein's leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals by other people at Bear Stearns:

Q: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in connection with your reasons for leaving the firm?

A: I'm aware that there were many rumors.

Q: What were the rumors you heard?

A: Nothing to do with St. Joe.

Q: Can you relate what you heard?

A: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.

Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or communication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members or employees of Bear Stearns?

A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it's been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.

Q: Have you heard it from anyone else?

A: No.

A little later the interview focuses on James Cayne:

Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or insider information in connection with St. Joe Minerals Corporation?

A: No.

Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?

A: No.

Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?

tions between Mr. Cayne and anyone else regarding St. Joe Minerals?
A: No.

And still later in the questioning comes this exchange:

Q: Have you had any type of business dealings with Mr. Cayne?
A: There's no relationship with Bear Stearns.
Q: Pardon?
A: Other than Bear Stearns, no.
Q: Have you been a participant in any type of business venture with Mr. Cayne?
A: No.
Q: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne?
A: No.
Q: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram?
A: No; nor do I anticipate any.
Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission?
A: No.
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or substance, that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and Exchange Commission?
A: No.

Despite the circumstances of Epstein's leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual bonus—which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000.

The S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading in St. Joe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's answers. Some sources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given it up over a mere $2,500 fine.

Certainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck didn't seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.

One of Epstein's first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up with the idea of financing these bids through Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois insurance companies, Associated Life and United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on the securities side of the insurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a profit for us and for the companies," Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also alleged that Epstein was the "technician," executing the schemes, although, having no broker's license, he had to rely on others to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's subsequent testimony in his criminal case has proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be accomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen, the former treasurer of United Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He and another executive say they had direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his deposition of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one who executed "all" Hoffenberg's instructions to buy and sell the stock. He called it "making the orders." He could not recall whether he had chosen the brokers used.

To win approval from the Illinois insurance regulators for Towers's acquisition of the companies, Hoffenberg promised to inject $3 million of new capital into them. In fact, in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg claimed that he, his chief operating officer, Mitchell Brater, and Epstein came up with a scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Emery stock. "Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater arranged the various brokerage accounts for the bonds to be placed with in New York, and I think one in Chicago, Rodman &amp; Renshaw," Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then, said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as though they were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments, they used them as collateral to buy the stock. "Epstein was the person in charge of the transactions, and Mitchell Brater was assisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies' money," Hoffenberg claimed at the time.

At one point, according to Hoffenberg, a broker forged the documents necessary for a $1.8 million check to be written on insurance-company funds. The check was used to buy more stock in the takeover targets. Meanwhile, in order to throw the insurance regulators off, the $1.8 million was reported as being safely invested in a money-market account.

United Fire's former chief financial officer Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg's account. He says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffenberg's direction) about the missing bonds. "He said, 'Oh, yeah, they still exist.' But we found out later that he had sold those assets ... leveraged them ... [and] used some margin account to take some positions in ... Emery and Pan Am," says Payton.

Epstein's extraordinary creativity was, according to Hoffenberg, responsible for the purchase by the insurance companies of a $500,000 bond, with no money down. "Epstein created a great scheme to purchase a $500,000 treasury bond that would not be shown ... [as] margined or collateralized."

he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked like it was free and clear but it actually wasn't," he said.

Epstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies. But Richard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg's direction and telling him it was urgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said, "We'll get them back." He had "kind of a flippant attitude," says Allen. "They never came back."

Epstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery Freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg's bid went wrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients' accounts controlled by Epstein.

Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and Epstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing. Barry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein. "He was very elusive... It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks for significant dollars that were paid to him. I remember... He was this character we never got a handle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that Hoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him."

"From the government's discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy," says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. "They went for what they knew they could get ... and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the much larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud, based in New York State]... What they couldn't get, they didn't bother with."

Another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says. "In a criminal investigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is always incomplete... They don't have to line up witnesses; they don't have to learn every fact that might come out on cross-examination."

Epstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show that in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures football helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told Nederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker.

whose identity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from him, and Towers's financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he can't remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers financial reports.)

Around the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source, Epstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to find other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an investor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money. But in his 1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his own money. Where did the rest come from? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn't know about.

Two things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a possible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were "reasons" he didn't want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, co-investors recall Epstein announcing that he'd found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein nor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had recruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)

According to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but, without their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and bought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.

"Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn't part of the deal, saying he was owed all this money," says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were baffled.

"Personally, a source close to Hoffenberg on the Penberg paid Snyder off.

Just as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash was approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his connection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that "it was certainly not the same time."

Wherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate and strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very smart with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend."

## OFFICE SPACE

The "office" in Epstein's house. It has no computers, but it does have a desk that Epstein tells people once belonged to banker J. P. Morgan, and "the largest Persian rug you'll ever see in a private home."

Sources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with "fresh" ideas about investments. "Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right away," says a former associate of Epstein's.

Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of Wexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found incomprehensible. "In fact," says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, "almost everyone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere."

"Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was," says Robert Morosky, a former vice-chairman of the Limited

Much of Epstein's work is related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says Epstein is involved in "everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!" In addition, he says, "Wexner likes having a hatchet man... Whenever there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jeffrey on it... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done."

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. "He was that mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of," says a former employee.

Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner's company with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner's yacht... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that eventually built the vessel," says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and Kelly, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner's Limitless—at 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying Dickerson and Reily for its work. "It's probably once or twice in my legal career that I've had to sue a client for payment of services that he'd requested and we'd performed... without issue on the performance," says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now has no recollection of it.

The incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums so tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the U.S. Attorney's Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact terms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.

he is winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you choose your weapon."

One case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from its private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank "fraudulently induced" him into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995, Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers fled in this dispute is Epstein's financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed that he owned 57 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although he told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other assets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: "The company had been bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn't public, so it was meaningless to attach a figure like that to it ... the price it cost was about $1.2 million." The co-investors bought out Epstein's share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was asked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has explained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by Wexner. One of the investors calls this "bullshit."

Epstein's appointment to the board of New York's Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him into greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Goldstein. "Epstein was thrilled to be elected," says someone who knows him.

After one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn't like to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says he had insufficient time to present a board member recalls that he was "arrogant" and "not a good fit." The spokesperson admits that it is "infrequent" for board members not to be renominated after only one term.

Still, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In November he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion show at New York's Lexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful women were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) for a long weekend.

Thanks to Epstein's introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from Princeton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and professor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office at the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature's algorithms, a pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak's. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked toward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers's letter of commitment as if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and Wexner told him it was all right.

An insatiable, restless soul, always on the move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount of downtime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his relaxation: it's as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says that, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they'll get up at six and, as the sun rises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. "Then he'll go off and do some work, re-appear, and we'll talk some more."

Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women remembers that the women "sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea... He's like a king in his own world."

Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, "Absolutely. I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas."

Accused of paying underage girls for sex, superrich money manager Jeffrey Epstein is finding that living in a dream world is dangerous—even if you can pay for it.

- By Philip Weiss

Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I’d expected that when he came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line—“I never realized how many one-way streets and no-right-turns there are in midtown. I finally got out and walked”—and as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein’s office, he asked, “Have you managed to talk to many of my friends?” Epstein had been supplying me the phone numbers of important scientists and financiers and media figures. “Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?"

One of the accusers—a girl of 14—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. "I've only ever seen him in jeans," his
friend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein's
signal that he doesn't have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.

I told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic
delight in every word. "A secretive genius," I'd said. "Not secretive, private," he corrected in his warm
Brooklyn accent. "And if I was a genius I wouldn't be sitting here." "A guy with sex issues." A smile
formed on Epstein's bow-shaped lips. "What do you mean by sex issues?" Well ... He was 54, had
never married—I didn't finish. "Are you channeling my mother?"

When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein's soul. "It's the Icarus story,
someone who flies too close to the sun," I said. "Did Icarus like massages?" Epstein asked.

Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attorney.
"Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound
for him; that is why he has had many massages." Epstein had even given $100,000 to Ballet Florida's
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.

I never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there's
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the power to
dazzle and, though accused of "doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah," as one friend put it, seemed
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least bit tawdry.

"He lives in a different environment," says Siegal. "He's of this world. But he creates this different
environment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent townhouse I've ever been in, and I've been in
everything. I've seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the
Caribbean—it is not to be believed. I've seen photographs of the apartment in Paris ... How did he get
himself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He's very mysterious. Not that many
people get close to him. Not that many people know him."

The descriptions of Epstein's character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at
the vital distance from normal humanity. He lives in what is described as the largest private residence in
Manhattan, about 50,000 square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 71st. Visitors report a
stuffed poodle is on the piano. The house, said one visitor, is like what Hollywood might imagine when
it tries to show the superrich. When Epstein noticed the visitor's astonishment at his surroundings, he
hauled against a wall with a soft smile and tapped the paneling. "It's all fake," he said. "Epstein
in Coney Island, the son of a Parks Department employee. He never got a college degree. He studied
women at Cooper Union and then NYU before migrating inevitably toward wealth. For two years, he
was in the school for a full time and math at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, till
when there, a friend of the father of one of Epstein's students, offered him a job at Bear Stearns. In one

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein’s rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house; Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein’s forte was dealing with wealthier clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no footman; he loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who could show the rich how to live with their money. “I want people to understand the power, the responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. “I think it’s all done with mirrors,” says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and lost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.

Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so darn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”

Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind goes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct answer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”

A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to make connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an extremely short attention span. Why?—it’s not that he’s bored. He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert's statements."

Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference on the West Coast in his beautiful 727.

"It was all a little giddy," Wolff says. "There's a little food out, lovely hors d'oeuvre. And then after fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks, loafers, a button-down shirt, shirttails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall I say this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things. You didn't know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very tall girls?"

Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 71st Street. He understood that there was a purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his *Uber*-way. "What does the media mean, where does he fit into it?" Then Epstein began to show up in the press. In 2002, he flew Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being written about. In 2003, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was involved in a bid for *New York Magazine*. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. "His literal office is where Bennett Cerf's was. It's an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at all. It's almost European. It's old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way." Nearby, Wolff went on, "the trading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They're like a throwback, a bunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say 'What's going on here?' and he gives you that Cheshire smile."

Epstein likes to say he's private, but you don't fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One friend says the Africa trip was Epstein's Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends' theory of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief battened onto a rich man because he was not living in a box like everyone else.

The dazzling arc of Epstein's comet came to an end—without his knowing it—in March 2005. That was when a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name, said that she believed her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The stepmother had learned about the matter in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an "involuntary-admitted juvenile educational facility" because of behavior problems. She had shown up at the school with $300 in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a "whore," another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a call from another student's mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present. The girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of 25 who wasn't very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in, naked but for a towel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he touched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.

Next: The police lock onto Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle.

The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn't make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw themselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way.

Palm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach, where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein's house. The 14-year-old was used to set up her 18-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. "I'm like Heidi Fleiss," she said. The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls, who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her the younger the better—which she said meant 18 to 20. The rules were simple. Tell him you're 18. There might be some touching; you could draw the line. "The more you do, the more you are paid." A couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times, another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-19-year-old beauty who Epstein told one of them was his "sex slave"; he'd purchased her from her family back in Yugoslavia.

Epstein's friends' belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto Epstein's sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls' thong panties, the shape and color of the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner's plane, noting the procession of Cadillac Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein, through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-shaped soaps.

Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn't see his sex life as tawdry, wasn't hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from "a deep and basic cultural moment" once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. "Jeffrey is living a life that once might have been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgrown it. You can't describe it without being held to severe account. It's not allowed. It may be allowed if you're secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an achievement to Jeffrey."

Some girls who "worked" for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who allegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was "so in love with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him." Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-fact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.

But generally the girls' feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein was the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl "stated she was very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over." Another kept looking at the clock, and Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They didn't like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn't want it inside them. Some couldn't say just what

Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “powerful” and was afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to model the underwear he’d bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was so upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”

Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like Hugh Hefner’s. *Playboy* was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn is men with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-school cheerleaders or college girls on break, and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52, Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of *The Bang Bros*, *Girls Gone Wild*, and *Coeds Need Cash*, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that his activities would result in a police investigation.

His claim that he’d given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily massages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy endings.

Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.

The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein wouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered whatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.

“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he was talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like young women.’ ”

Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, provided the police and the state attorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say, “Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”

By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the

waterway to the Palm Beach County state attorney's office, but the state attorney apparently saw the main witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on MySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria's Secret. The police wanted numerous felony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they heard that the state attorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and sending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state attorney of bending over backward for a rich man and then turned the matter over to the FBI.

Finally, in July 2006, the Palm Beach County state attorney's office handed down one indictment of Epstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment. Reiter was enraged. He released a letter he had sent out to five underage girls that read "I do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served."

Epstein's lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S. Attorney's office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the former Clinton prosecutor.

One of Epstein's friends told me, "He thinks there's an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm Beach. He's convinced of that. Maybe it's a defense mechanism." Palm Beach was historically a bastion of Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the public fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems stuck in the time of the Gentlemen's Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I asked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple Emanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. "There's no way, shape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes. And there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew." Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues from opening. There are now four on the little island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast founder Danny Abraham. José Lambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, "Half my sources on the island are Jewish socialites." No, not at all... - requester who is appointed by closet how vichas were treated as Jewish

Lambiet says the case has fed rage within the community over Palm Beach rules: The rich never have to do time. William Kennedy Smith in 1991, Rush Limbaugh, lately Ann Coulter for a voting infraction.

Maybe it was inevitable that religion would come into the case. Peggy Siegal says Epstein's two big charitable causes are science and Israel. His Brooklyn homies Dershowitz and Rubenstein are also major Israel supporters. Dershowitz has written a book about lingering anti-Semitism in elite life. Now throw in the fact that the Palm Beach police asked at least three of the girls whether they had noticed whether Epstein was circumcised. "I asked ... if she knew what being circumcised meant," the officer stated in regard to the 14-year-old.

Of course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrative seem to derive more from Edgar Allan Poe's psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth's sociological comedies. Epstein is licensed in Florida to carry a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shower on the first floor was given over to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had a Harley next to the many black Mercedes, but his Florida license was expired. Now he was licensed in the Virgin Islands and gave his "permanent residence" as the same address as Island Yachts.

Notwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and joyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the sensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.

Next: Epstein maintains he's done nothing wrong.

The police narrative has overtones of a man avoiding all connection or intimacy. For years, Epstein had had a companion in a woman who could take him on if any woman could: Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell, the British newspaper baron, a Jew born in Czechoslovakia, who died mysteriously off his yacht in 1991. The British tabloids say that Epstein reminded Maxwell of her father and that she brought him into a Continental world. The Broadway and movie producer Jonathan Farkas says he and his wife used to double-date with the couple. Maxwell spent time at the Palm Beach house, and the police narrative says that she even hired an assistant-cum-masseuse for Epstein. But that was five years ago, and the girl was 23, at a local college. Maxwell never showed up in all the surveillance, only her stationery.

Epstein's activities seem to have devolved in recent years. Juan Alessi, his longtime houseman, told police that toward the end of his employment, the girls were "younger and younger," and he often had to wash off vibrators and "a long rubber penis" left in the sink. The next houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, said that he found the sex toys he had to wash "scattered on the floor."

gives youngest to young

No need to worry about dirty laundry, if there's someone to do it.

The U.S. attorney's investigation put Epstein in a bind. If the Feds brought a case and he lost, he would be imprisoned for a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Given the choice, it appears that Epstein will not gamble on a trial but make a deal with the state attorney on the prostitution charge.

Not that he is likely to admit that he did anything wrong. Throughout his ordeal, Epstein maintained the air that there was nothing sordid about his actions. His wealth seems to have endowed him with utter shamelessness, the emperor's new clothes with an erection. Even Alan Greenspan has lately raised the moral questions brought on by the gap between the rich and poor: The poor will begin to feel that the social contract was not made in good faith. Epstein's friends say that on this matter, he has a philosophical position.

"Fundamentally," Wolff says, "it's about math. That on a macro level it inevitably happens that the rich get richer. And then at some level the rich get richer on a geometric basis. Jeffrey's point is that this whole issue is—it's just mathematics at this point. This is the nature of a successful economy. The more successful the economy is, and that would be the goal of everybody, a successful economy, the greater the discrepancy actually is."

There is no better place to observe how Epstein's mathematics work than Palm Beach. The only signs of life are crews of Spanish-speaking laborers on teetering ladders clipping the high hedges, not far from Bulgari and Valentino and Tiffany. It is a few miles on the other side of the bridge to where the girls came from, the shabby sprawl of West Palm Beach, with trailer parks, boys crouched on motor scooters, and pickup trucks under sun tents. Haley Robson's house is on an unpaved road by an irrigation ditch. An attractive blonde in her forties answers the door wearing pistachio Capri pants, and promptly slams it. "We have absolutely no comment about the Epstein case."

Driving home with their $500, Haley said to the 14-year-old that if they did this every Saturday they'd be rich, and it's understandable that a teenager in West Palm Beach might feel that way. The coldest stories in the police narrative are about money and service. Maria Alessi, the previous houseman's wife, said she had cleaned house and shopped for Epstein for eight years and never had a direct conversation with him. He made it clear that he did "not want to encounter the Alessis during his stay in Palm Beach." One girl said that when she had sex with Epstein she closed her eyes and thought about cash.

"In my mind, I'm like, 'Oh my God, when this is over you're getting so much money.'"

José Lambiet says the case went forward in Palm Beach despite the efforts of the dream team because of community rage arising from the class issues in the case—Epstein found the girls not from his own fancy neighborhood but from the struggling suburbs.

He has never shown a glimmer of understanding that a high-school girl could be damaged by a powerful 50-year-old's demands, or that some of the girls were already emotionally damaged. For someone who could dream anything, it seems a little small.

MR. BIG

Jeffrey Epstein in New York, 2001. Left, Epstein's nine-floor, 51,000-square-foot town house. He also owns a 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico, a house in Palm Beach, and a Caribbean island.

Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's high-flying style has been drawing oohs and aahs: the bachelor financier lives in New York's largest private residence, claims to take only billionaires as clients, and flies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey on his Boeing 727. But pierce his air of mystery and the picture changes. VICKY WARD explores Epstein's investment career, his ties to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past

![img-21.jpeg](img-21.jpeg)

n Manhattan's Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists the crown jewel of the city's residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge arched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or rather, commands—the block of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not surprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's largest private residence.

Inside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you feel you have stumbled into someone's private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person's home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.

The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner of Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.

Despite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants to be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he "could never live anywhere bigger." He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like himself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does not touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the "leather room," so called because of the cordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling lionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the menservants in white gloves.

Upstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the "office," an enormous gallery spanning the width of the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the "computer room" (a smaller room at the back of the house). Epstein has been known to say. The office features a gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan). 18th-century black lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway "D" grand. On the desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade's The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted. Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, "is the largest Persian rug you'll ever see in a private home—so big, it must have come from a mosque." Amid such splendor, much of which reflects the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. "No decorator would ever tell you to do that," Epstein brags to visitors. "But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog." People can't help but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he always has the last word.

In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named "Zorro." "It makes the town house look like a shack," Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman's grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.

Epstein is charming, but he doesn't let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. "You be white. You get the first move." It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no matter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York's moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.

"He's very enigmatic," says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany &amp; Co. in the U.K. and a close friend since the early 1980s. "You think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion skin and there's something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his hand... He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get."

![img-22.jpeg](img-22.jpeg)

Even acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a "modern maharaja," as Leah Kleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists himself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings or funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like "eating on the subway"—i.e., something he'd never do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom he has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade, Ghislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as simply his "best friend." He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his life—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for him. (Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former associate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva Andersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend "moves up, not down," to friendship status.)

Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon Leon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won't find Epstein's transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. "The trading desks don't seem to know him. It's unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow," says a high-level investment manager.

Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires—who depend on him for discretion. "I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more," he tells people freely. According to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency markets "with very large sums of money," have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today.

Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells people, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding those problems: "Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The key is not to have it do harm more than anything else... You don't want to lose your money."

He has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically, one who specializes in remodeling: "I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as he became wealthier had add-ons. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage ... until you have a house that is usually a mess... It's a large house that has been put together over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs."

He makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer, money manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, mays and rumor swirl around Epstein.

Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn't mind people knowing: He grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city's parks department. His parents viewed education as "the way out" for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went to Brooklyn's Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a daughter of Greenberg's. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a limited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said, he wanted to run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a

"bounty hunter," recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to carry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he's been running his business, J. Epstein &amp; Co.

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in 1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to be accepted by the Establishment. He's a member of various commissions and councils: he is on the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of International Education.

His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and

"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," says Wexner. "But Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and design. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them."

# "Jeffrey [knows] when he is winning... He will let you choose your weapon," says Wexner.

By the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion empire—one that now includes Victoria's Secret, Express, and Bath &amp; Body Works—from $5,000 lent him by his aunt. "Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to realize his [Jeffrey's] dreams," says someone who has worked closely with both men. "He gave Jeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park."

Wexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2 million in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the newlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now owns the house.

Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak. When these men describe Epstein, they talk about "energy" and "curiosity," as well as a love for theoretical physics that they don't ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions that "there are always pretty ladies around" when he goes to dinner chez

Larry Summers, Harvard's current president. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says, "I'm on my 20th book... The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey." Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, "He digests and decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings."

Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize winners Gerald

Epstein, and he's under the impression that Epstein's clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named "Andrew" in Epstein's house. "Andrew" turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of Dershowitz's law class.

Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner "made him." "I had really rich clients before," he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship. Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. "People have said it's like we have one brain between two of us: each has a side."

Wexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of his private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even persuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner's ailing mother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by splitting the foundation in two.

Epstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He tells people, "I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes even from his own family—then it's often better that people hate me, not the client."

"You've probably heard I'm vicious in my representation of my clients," he tells people proudly; Leah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Even a former mentor says he's seen "the dark side" of Epstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making a presentation for Wexner as

being so brutal as to be "irresponsible."

One reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were delivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I don't like the article.

On the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based venture capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can't say enough nice things: "I have a boy who's dyslexic, and Jeffrey's gotten close to him over the years... Jeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons."

Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down syndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach anytime.

Some friends remember that in the late 80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of good friends by affixing first-class stickers; the only problem was that the stickers turned out to be unofficial. Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn't, and the unwitting recipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades, and had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein's largesse claim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. "I never felt he wanted anything from me in return," says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.

Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he is a familiar face to many of the Victoria's Secret girls. One young woman recalls being summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein's town house, where the women seemed to outnumber the men by far. "These were not women you'd see at Upper East Side dinners," the woman recalls. "Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely." This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was filled, she says, with young Russian models. "Some of the guests were horrified," the woman says.

"He's reckless," says a former business associate, "and he's gotten more so. Money does that to you. He's breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he must be in a very difficult place."

According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by Vanity Fair, Epstein may have good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.

When Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious head of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts that people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using company funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion on Long Island, homes on Manhattan's Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and planes.

Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making money. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by Douglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the late attorney general.

Epstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of his apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that he managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent $100 percent of his time helping people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers. He was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller investors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed against Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which Epstein put into oil. In 1984, Stroll asked for his money back: four years later he had received only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the check for $10,000 was for a horse he'd bought from Stroll. "My net worth never exceeded four and a half million dollars," Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, "really liked Jeffrey... Jeffrey has a way of getting under your skin, and he was under Hoffenberg's." Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein's social connections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan Murjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even then. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a Rolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque. Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship flourished. "They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg's plane, all around the world, they were always together," says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him, saying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing "illegal operations."

Several of Epstein's Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very suddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical infringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two supporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can't recall this: Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. "Jeffrey Epstein left Bear Stearns of his own volition," says Cayne. "It was never suggested that he leave by any member of management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said specifically, 'I don't want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.'" Yet, this is not the story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the S.E.C.'s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein's testimony and that of other Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading around a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe Minerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including Italian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.

After the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at

contains a parody of Affleck and Matt Damon making Good Will Hunting II. Affleck says to Damon, "What do I keep telling you? You gotta do the safe picture, then you do the art picture. Then sometimes you gotta do the payback picture because your friend says you owe him. Then sometimes you gotta go back to the well."

"Sometimes you do Reindeer Games," Damon says derisively.

"That's just mean," Affleck whines.

But it's a pretty accurate description of his career to date. "Ben takes these franchise properties so he can go and experiment," says Harvey Weinstein.

"He believes in trying to stretch himself and not keep doing the same thing," observes Bruce Willis, who starred with Affleck in Armageddon. "He's an awesome actor, and I think he's going to do great things."

Several years ago, in a televised interview on Inside the Actors Studio, Affleck said that his goal was to make big commercial movies. He has since revised his ambitions. "That's an adolescent aspiration, in a way. I'd rather be in movies like Magnolia, which I think is a towering achievement. I'll continue to act, but I won't act in a way that requires me to hang my name out there and do a lot of publicity. I'll do character roles and focus on writing and directing. It doesn't require the same kinds of sacrifice, in terms of quality of life and personal life, and it's a more holistic approach to the process. It's become increasingly frustrating for me to have my role in the storytelling process limited to one character. You have to be respectful and judicious about

your input when it's somebody else's project."

Affleck has always impressed colleagues with his voracious appetite for information and skills. "He has made it a point to learn everything he can about how the business works—not just the craft of acting, but from the producing standpoint, from the studio standpoint," says Jon Gordon, executive vice president of production at Miramax. "He knows how deals work. It's what sets him apart. If he wanted to run a studio at some point, he could. He's about as sharp as they come."

Affleck is already juggling his acting with screenwriting and such other commitments as Project Greenlight, the contest he and Damon started to help launch the careers of young filmmakers. Affleck's friends are certain he'll be directing soon. "There's no question," Weinstein says. "Both he and Matt. I think they're going to rewrite the rules. These guys can fix anything. There'll be home runs in both instances."

But there are other thoughts tickling the back of Affleck's mind as well. A passionate liberal, he campaigned for Al Gore, cares deeply about political issues, and is extremely well informed. He entertains himself by writing imaginary political speeches in his head. He would rather discuss AIDS in Africa than his movie career.

When Lopez goes to Affleck's mother's house for dinner, Weinstein reports, "J.Lo told me that the conversation at the table is always about politics—about government initiatives, educational initiatives, what's going on in the day."

So is Affleck planning to become the liberals' answer to Ronald Reagan. He admits that he entertains the thought of someday running for Congress, at least: "I think there's a real nobility to public service. It would be fun to run on a platform I really believed in, without any of the kind of compromises people make—without being beholden—the win-at-all-costs mentality."

And the invasion of privacy would be nothing new. "What are you going to say about me that hasn't already been said? I don't cheat, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I live a clean life," Affleck says, his eyes twinkling.

"He's only 30 years old," says Jennifer Todd, who co-produced Boiler Room. "He still has an enormous amount of time to do things."

Time, and drive. "I think he's incredibly hungry," says Sean Bailey, who founded the media and production company LivePlanet with Affleck, Damon, and Chris Moore. "I think the guy has very grand aspirations. I don't think he's going to be content with just being a movie star. He knows he has the potential to do very big things."

Such ambitions could be derailed by any number of miscalculations, including a private life that generates too many sensational headlines, but Affleck has a clear idea of the ultimate goal. "On my deathbed, I have to be one who looks back and feels I lived a good and substantial and meaningful life," he says.

In the meantime, however, there's a wedding to plan.

# Jeffrey Epstein

CONTINUED FROM PAGE 303 Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he had found "offensive" the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action following its discovery that he had committed a possible "Reg D" violation—evidently he had lent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he'd lent approximately $20,000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered improper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward.

According to Epstein, Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around March 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and

Alvin Einbender. In his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an "issue" of the matter was Marvin Davidson. On March 9, Epstein said, he had met with Tarnopol and Einbender again, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense, together with previous "carelessness" over expenses, and he would be fined $2,500.

"There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and not myself and I said that it was possible. ... since my secretary handles my expenses," Epstein told the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the "Reg D" incident had cost him a shot at partnership that year.

What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection between Epstein's leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals by other people at Bear Stearns:

Q: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in connection with your reasons for leaving the firm?

A: I'm aware that there were many rumors.

Q: What were the rumors you heard?

A: Nothing to do with St. Joe.

Q: Can you relate what you heard?

A: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.

Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or communication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members or employees of Bear Stearns?

A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it's been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.

Q: Have you heard it from anyone else?

A: No.

A little later the interview focuses on James Cayne:

Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have traded or in sider information in connection with St. J. Minerals Corporation?

A: No.

Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?

A: No.

Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversa

tions between Mr. Cayne and anyone else regarding St. Joe Minerals?

A: No.

And still later in the questioning comes this exchange:

Q: Have you had any type of business dealings with Mr. Cayne?
A: There's no relationship with Bear Stearns.
Q: Pardon?
A: Other than Bear Stearns, no.
Q: Have you been a participant in any type of business venture with Mr. Cayne?
A: No.
Q: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne?
A: No.
Q: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram?
A: No; nor do I anticipate any.
Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission?
A: No.
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or substance, that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and Exchange Commission?
A: No.

Despite the circumstances of Epstein's leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual bonus—which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000.

The S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading in St. Joe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein's answers. Some sources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given it up over a mere $2,500 fine.

Certainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck didn't seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.

One of Epstein's first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. Hoffenberg claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up with the idea of financing these bids through Towers's acquisition of two ailing Illinois insurance companies, Associated Life and United Fire. "He was hired by us to work on the securities side of the insurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a profit for us and for the companies," Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also alleged that Epstein was the "technician," executing the schemes, although, having no broker's license, he had to rely on others to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg's subsequent testimony in his criminal case has proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be accomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen, the former treasurer of United Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He and another executive say they had direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his deposition of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one who executed "all" Hoffenberg's instructions to buy and sell the stock. He called it "making the orders." He could not recall whether he had chosen the brokers used.

To win approval from the Illinois insurance regulators for Towers's acquisition of the companies, Hoffenberg promised to inject $3 million of new capital into them. In fact, in his grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg claimed that he, his chief operating officer, Mitchell Brater, and Epstein came up with a scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance companies' bonds to buy Pan Am and Emery stock. "Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater arranged the various brokerage accounts for the bonds to be placed with in New York, and I think one in Chicago, Rodman &amp; Renshaw," Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then, said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as though they were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments, they used them as collateral to buy the stock. "Epstein was the person in charge of the transactions, and Mitchell Brater was assisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies' money," Hoffenberg claimed at the time.

At one point, according to Hoffenberg, a broker forged the documents necessary for a $1.8 million check to be written on insurance-company funds. The check was used to buy more stock in the takeover targets. Meanwhile, in order to throw the insurance regulators off, the $1.8 million was reported as being safely invested in a money-market account.

United Fire's former chief financial officer Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg's account. He says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffenberg's direction) about the missing bonds. "He said, 'Oh, yeah, they still exist.' But we found out later that he had sold those assets ... leveraged them ... [and] used some margin account to take some positions in ... Emery and Pan Am," says Payton.

Epstein's extraordinary creativity was, according to Hoffenberg, responsible for the purchase by the insurance companies of a $500,000 bond, with no money down. "Epstein created a great scheme to purchase a $500,000 treasury bond that would not be shown ... [as] margined or collateralized."

he reportedly told the grand jury. "It looked like it was free and clear but it actually wasn't," he said.

Epstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies. But Richard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg's direction and telling him it was urgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said, "We'll get them back." He had "kind of a flippant attitude," says Allen. "They never came back."

Epstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery Freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg's bid went wrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients' accounts controlled by Epstein.

Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and Epstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing. Barry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein. "He was very elusive... It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks for significant dollars that were paid to him. I remember... He was this character we never got a handle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that Hoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him."

"From the government's discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the government was perhaps a bit lazy," says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. "They went for what they knew they could get ... and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the much larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg's fraud, based in New York State]... What they couldn't get, they didn't bother with."

Another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says. "In a criminal investigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is always incomplete... They don't have to line up witnesses; they don't have to learn every fact that might come out on cross-examination."

Epstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show that in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures football helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and attorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told Nederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker.

3407/26/17

whose identity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from him, and Towers's financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000. (Epstein has said he can't remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers financial reports.)

Around the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to make money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source, Epstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to find other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an investor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money. But in his 1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his own money. Where did the rest come from? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn't know about.

Two things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a possible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were "reasons" he

didn't want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, co-investors recall Epstein announcing that he'd found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein nor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had recruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)

According to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but, without their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and bought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.

"Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn't part of the deal, saying he was owed all this money," says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were baffled.

Frequently, a source close to Hoffenberg 07/26/17 inberg paid Snyder off.

Just as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly involved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and his late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash was approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his connection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that "it was certainly not the same time."

Wherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate and strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is "very smart with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend."

![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)

## OFFICE SPACE

The "office" in Epstein's house. It has no computers, but it does have a desk that Epstein tells people once belonged to banker J. P. Morgan, and "the largest Persian rug you'll ever see in a private home."

Sources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with "fresh" ideas about investments. "Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right away," says a former associate of Epstein's.

Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of Wexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found incomprehensible. "In fact," says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, "almost everyone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere."

"Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was," says Robert Morosky, a former vice-chairman of the company.

Much of Epstein's work is related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says Epstein is involved in "everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!" In addition, he says, "Wexner likes having a hatchet man... Whenever there is dirty work to be done he'd stick Jeffrey on it... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done."

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. "He was that mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of," says a former employee.

Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner's company with whom he now deals. "He 'inserted' himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner's yacht... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner

and the shipyard that eventually built the vessel," says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and K. y. was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner's Limitless—at 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying Dickerson and Reily for its work. "It's probably once or twice in my legal career that I've had to sue a client for payment of services that he'd requested and we'd performed... without issue

on the performance," says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now has no recollection of it.

The incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums so tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold him the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the U.S. Attorney's Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact terms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.

Wexner offers some insight into his life and a combative style. "Many times people are thinking and losing," Wexner said.

he is winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight, he will let you choose your weapon."

One case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from its private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank "fraudulently induced" him into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein's finances. In 1995, Epstein stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute is Epstein's financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed that he owned $7 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although he told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other assets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: "The company had been bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn't public, so it was meaningless to attach a figure like that to it ... the price it cost was about $1.2 million." The co-investors bought out Epstein's share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was asked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has explained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by Wexner. One of the investors calls this "bullshit."

Epstein's appointment to the board of New York's Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him into greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor, and Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph Goldstein. "Epstein was thrilled to be elected," says someone who knows him.

After one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn't like to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says: "I felt because he had insufficient time to commit a board member recalls that he

was "arrogant" and "not a good fit." The spokesperson admits that it is "infrequent" for board members not to be renominated after only one term.

Still, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In November he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria's Secret fashion show at New York's Lexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful women were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St. Jeff) for a long weekend.

Thanks to Epstein's introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from Princeton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and professor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office at the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature's algorithms, a pursuit that is a specialty of Nowak's. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked toward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers's letter of commitment as if he can't quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and Wexner told him it was all right.

An insatiable, restless soul, always on the move. Epstein builds a tremendous amount of downtime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his relaxation: it's as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says that, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they'll get up at six and, as the sun rises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. "Then he'll go off and do some work, re-appear, and we'll talk some more."

Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women remembers that the women "sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea... He's like a king in his own world."

Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, "Absolutely. I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas."

## Abstract (Document Summary)

Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000. [Jeffrey Epstein]’s mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1. Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.

SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these days.

"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa," his investigation into a lynching that his grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and I write about what really happened." James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party Monster," the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath." But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. "I didn't know I was so gay! I thought I was more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually, and looks better in drag."

PAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had flown Bill Clinton, Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over town trying to find out just who Epstein really is.

Vanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week on Epstein's strange history.

Epstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $15 billion for super-wealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $1 billion in assets.

"According to people who know him," New York reports, "if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the services of Epstein &amp; Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you."

Noted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft recalls trying to give Epstein a client whose funds were below the $1 billion cutoff.

"I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him," Block reports. "Said the account was too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's Jeffrey."

Most Wall Streeters, however, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. "My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him," says one powerful investor. "He once told me that he has 300 people working for him, and I've also heard he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz."

Some say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a suit, supposedly telling a friend, "It feels like wearing a dress."

One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump.

"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years," The Donald tells the magazine. "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."

Another thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a
taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street.

Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000.
Epstein's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just $1.
Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.

"I don't want to live in another person's house," Epstein told New York.

Blind dater

CHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The "Law &amp; Order" hunk was set up on a blind date with
Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at
the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the
set of "Sex and the City." MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson.

'Rockets' soars

"ROCKETS Redglare!" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand
Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by
Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets' pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim
Jarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk
legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of Buscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of
drug abuse.

Bizarre union

BOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. "He treated women like the rest of the
world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?" she told "20/20" contributing correspondent
Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and
videotape, Pat insists: "We had a wonderful sex life. We had a wonderful marriage." Crane was bludgeoned to
death in 1978 with a camera tripod.

Plot device

GAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel "The
Night We Met," a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Byrnes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After
making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Byrnes even attempts to replicate one of our
items in the climax. Byrnes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does
have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.

Change partners

SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in
flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a
new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these
days.

## Palm Beach chief focus of fire in Epstein case

### Defendant's lawyers take him on; he slams state attorney

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.

Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter’s “craziness,” one of Epstein’s lawyers said. His department disseminated “a distorted view of the case” and behaved in a “childish” manner when the grand jury didn’t indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer complained.

To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he’s embroiled in a messy divorce.

Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation Wednesday. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is particularly ugly.

Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney.

# Colleagues cite chief's professionalism, integrity

► REITER from 1B

ney's office for two reasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.

In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case "highly unusual." He added, "I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases."

In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. "It looks like a departure from professionalism," Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter.

Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws.

Reiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to describe the chief professional.

"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership," said Rick Lincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years.

"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity."

![img-33.jpeg](img-33.jpeg)

Reiter: Town Manager Peter Elwell says the Palm Beach police chief's well worth his $144,000 salary.

Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on countywide law enforcement issues. "I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a professional demeanor from him."

Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations.

Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at fault.

Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family compound in Palm Beach.

Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a "top secret" national security clearance.

"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town," said Town Manager Peter Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.

"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work," Elwell said. "I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years."

Jeffrey Epstein - a self-proclaimed billionaire who hobnobs with moguls and pledged $25 million to Harvard - is actually a small potatoes ex-bounty hunter with a questionable financial background, says a report.

Epstein, a 50-year-old Ralph Lauren lookalike who claims to manage a billionaires-only fund, has made headlines for his high- society lifestyle; among his attention-grabbing moves was flying President Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on a private jet.

But a report in the March issue of Vanity Fair, on newsstands this week, unmasks Epstein's mystery image.

Epstein wasn't exactly the top gun at Bear Stearns, as he claims - and left the firm amid a swirl of rumors and an SEC violation, the article said.

His mentor in high finance was Steve Hoffenberg, the bill collector turned hustler now serving 20 years in prison for running the nation's costliest Ponzi scheme, the report says.

The article says that when Epstein worked for Hoffenberg, he cooked up some of Hoffenberg's questionable financing deals - a claim Epstein has denied.

Epstein has also been involved in numerous lawsuits, including one in which Citibank is suing him for defaulting on $20 million in loans from its private banking arm.

Epstein and his lawyer, Jeffrey Schantz, couldn't be reached for comment on the article.

The article said that Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, except for one - retail magnate Leslie Wexner, who calls Epstein "smart . . . [with] high standards . . . and a loyal friend."

I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&amp;M-themed party. Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set" have recently sworn off any kind of publicity.

THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&amp;M-themed party. Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set" have recently sworn off any kind of publicity. A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid "Bright Young Things," written by one of their own, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this crowd as a bunch of twits living off their trust funds.

Ghislaine's own funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least one business in New York. But Maxwell's own ill-gotten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht, which was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the crash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to own an apartment on the Upper East Side and a mews house in London.

She is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly has holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of attractive young women, and it's said that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.

Ghislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be heavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing were diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going down the toilet.

## Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery

He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is.

By Landon Thomas Jr.

Cash Casual: Epstein dresses down. (Photo credit: Courtesy of Jeffrey Epstein)

He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies -- to say nothing of a relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists across the country -- and for financial markets around the world. Ever since the Post's "Page Six" ran an item about the president's late-September visit to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker -- on his new benefactor's customized Boeing 727 -- the question of the day has been: Who in the world is Jeffrey Epstein?

It's a life full of question marks. Epstein is said to run $15 billion for wealthy clients, yet aside from Limited founder Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held secret. A former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of brilliant scientists yet possesses no bachelor's degree. For more than ten years, he's been linked to Manhattan-London society figure Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media titan Robert Maxwell, yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his various planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is said to be Manhattan's largest private house yet runs his business from a 100-acre private island in St. Thomas.

Power on Wall Street has generally accrued to those who have made their

"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him," says one well-known investor. "He once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than meets the eye."

Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird."

The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.

He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It feels like a dress," he told one friend.

Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in people -- be it politics or science. It's what I do," he has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a

species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, "If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest politician."

"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS."

Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. "It's a mysterious relationship that they have," says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. "In one way, they are soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional relationship, where they serve each other's purposes."

Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-octane than Epstein's, lent a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of the private equity firm Leeds Weld &amp; Co. "He's a talented money manager and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual, though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-promoter."

Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High School. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975, Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.

By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets Society type of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that he said to Epstein point-blank: "What are you doing teaching math at Dalton? You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace Greenberg a call."

## The Wexner War
August 1, 2003

We can only imagine Limited founder and apparel mag- nate Leslie Wexner’s consternation over the leaking of a document entitled, Wexner Analysis: Israeli Communication Priorities 2003. The report was prepared for the Wexner Foundation and provides insight into Wexner’s relationship with the state of Israel. As the Cleveland Plain Dealer noted, Wexner keeps his personal life “under padlock.” But what has surfaced over the years simply adds to his mystery. In the Shapiro murder file, personally ordered destroyed by Columbus Chief of Police James Jackson, Wexner is listed as an alleged organized crime associate. A December 1995 Architectural Digest article and a follow-up 1996 New York Times report detailed the inner sanctum of Wexner’s former Manhattan townhouse, one of the largest in the city.

“Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink,” wrote the Times. The townhouse is now reportedly owned by Wexner’s even more mysterious protégé, Jeffrey E. Epstein.

Epstein, who recently loaned his jet to President Clinton, is usually seen in the company of Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of deceased publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. After Maxwell fell or was pushed off his yacht in 1991, it was revealed that he was working for the Israeli government and the Mossad, the Israeli Intelligence service. While Maxwell’s ties to the Mossad are well-documented, Epstein’s connections are less well known. The London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows: “He’s Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he’s a concert pianist, property developer, a CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.” New York Magazine claims Epstein is the man who moves Wexner’s billions around the globe.

Wexner’s philanthropic side is more public. In 1998, the Wall Street Journal reported that Wexner was part of the “Mega Group,” a loosely organized club of 20 of the nation’s wealthiest and most influential Jewish businessmen.” The Mega Group meets purportedly to discuss “philanthropy,” but others have speculated that their charitable interests are often a cover for lobbying activities on behalf of Israel. The Wall Street Journal identified Max Fisher, a Detroit financier and billionaire, as a member of the Mega Group. Fisher was used as a private Middle East diplomat by President Gerald Ford during the 1970s and is considered Wexner’s mentor.

So, when the Wexner Analysis report was leaked, it caused a stir but no questioning of Wexner’s little-explored relationships with Epstein and Fisher. Frank Lutz, the Republican Party pollster and spin doctor, prepared the Wexner Analysis. Lutz’s report essentially outlines a political PR campaign “as the post-war dust settles over the Iraqi desert.”

The Wexner Analysis points out that “. . . many sympathize with the plight of the Palestinian people, [but] there is no love lost for Yassir Arafat.” The report complains that, “the emergence of Mahmoud Abbas as the new Palestinian Prime Minister comes exactly at the wrong time.”

Why? “His ascent to power seems legitimate. He is a fresh face, and a clean-shaven one at that. He speaks well and dresses in Western garb,” the report states. Lutz’s assessment is that “the Palestinians throw us this curve ball.”

Still, the Wexner Analysis emphasizes that "now is the time to link American success in dealing with terrorism and dictators from a position of strength to Israel's ongoing efforts to eradicate terrorism on and within its borders."

Lutz, realizing the value of an Arab bogeymen, stresses that "Saddam Hussein' are the two words that tie Israel to America and are most likely to deliver support in Congress. The day we allow Saddam to take his eventual place in the trash heap of history is the day we lose our strongest weapon in the linguistic defense of Israel.

In the "Essential Conclusion" section of the report, Lutz offers 10 recommendations. The first is: "Iraq colors all. Saddam is your best defense, even if he is dead. For a year - a SOLID YEAR - you should be invoking the name of Saddam Hussein and how Israel was always behind American efforts to rid the world of this ruthless dictator and liberate their people."

Now, as the occupation of Iraq begins to look like the dreaded quagmire, and American troops are dying at the rate of almost one a day, more scrutiny should come to the role of those who pushed for the attack on Iraq, since Saddam Hussein neither had links to Al Qaeda nor posed a threat to the United States.

The Project for the New American Century, the major ideological force behind the illegal attack on Iraq, are generally more concerned with Hussein's threat to Israel than to the United States. Recent reports that Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, advised President Bush to include the bogus reference to uranium from Niger in the State of the Union address demonstrates a much bigger problem.

Lobbying groups like the Mega Group and government insiders like Wolfowitz and Richard Pearle are engaged in a systematic campaign to identify Israeli national security interests with U.S. military and security interests. The Wexner Analysis merely documents this extensive, often covert campaign, that deserves public debate and democratic discourse, not secret PR campaigns.

# After long probe, 7/26 billionaire faces solicitation charge

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein paid to have underage girls and young women brought to his home, where he received massages and sometimes sex, according to an investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department.

Palm Beach police spent months sifting through Epstein's trash and watching his waterfront home and Palm Beach International Airport to keep tabs on his private jet. An indictment charging Epstein, 53, was unsealed Monday, charging him with one count of felony solicitation of prostitution.

Palm Beach police thought there was probable cause to charge Epstein with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation.

Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry with State Attorney Barry Krischer's handling of the case that he wrote a memo

# Mystery money man faces soliciting charge

By NICOLE JANOK
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

A part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey was jailed early Sunday with accused drug dealers, drunken drivers and wife beaters after he was charged with soliciting a prostitute.

Manhattan money manager Jeffrey Epstein, 53, was picked up at his home on El Brillo Way at 1:45 a.m. He was released hours later on $3,000 bond.

Epstein was indicted last week by a state grand jury, according to state attorney’s spokesman Mike Edmondson. Despite Epstein’s arrest, the indictment containing the allegations remained sealed Sunday and Edmondson provided no details.

Unlike most accused johns, Epstein was charged with a third-degree felony instead of a misdemeanor. Under state law, a solicitation charge usually is elevated to a more serious felony when the defendant has at least two solicitation convictions.

However, checks of court records here and in New York Sunday turned up no such convictions.

Epstein could not be reached. Edmondson said he was being represented by West Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberg, who declined comment.

Epstein is the president of J Epstein &amp; Co., a money management company based in Manhattan that caters to ultra-wealthy clientele, according to pub

He has been in trouble before. In 1993, he and two other defendants were charged in federal court with three counts of postal larceny and theft and one count of property theft. Epstein plead guilty to a single charge of conspiring to steal U.S. Treasury checks from residential mailboxes and received 5 years’ probation. The remaining charges were dropped.

Since then, Epstein’s name has turned up in New York City’s tabloids. The New York Post noted he flew President Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private Boeing 727. In 2003, the paper dubbed him one of the Big Apple’s “top studs.”

In 2004, Epstein bid against Trump for a 43,000-square foot Palm Beach estate once owned by healthcare magnate Abe Gosman. Trump topped Epstein with a $41.35 million bid.

Investor facing felony sex charge

By WILLIAM KELLY
Daily News Staff Writer

Thursday, July 27, 2006

A billionaire investor and part-time Palm Beach resident has been indicted on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution after police say he had sex with underage girls whom he paid for massage sessions at his El Brillo Way home.

A Palm Beach County grand jury found that Jeffrey E. Epstein, 53, "did solicit, induce, entice or procure" prostitution with girls, who were between 14 and 16 years old, on at least three occasions between Aug. 1, 2004, and Oct. 31, 2005.

Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,000 bond. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-degree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the girls were minors.

The next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date will be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

A resident of New York, Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot waterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since 1990.

The indictment followed an 11-month sexual battery investigation by Palm Beach police that began in March 2005 after a woman told police that her 14-year-old stepdaughter may have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.

The investigation also focused on Epstein's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York City, and on Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by Epstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to Epstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor Robson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.

Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses concerning the massages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.

During their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone numbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according to police. Epstein would then pay the girls $200 or $300, police said.

Epstein is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with some of the girls on three occasions, and paid one girl $1,000 after she objected during sex, police said.

During the investigation, police said they learned of several more young women, all 18 years old or older, who consented to the "same massage routine" when they went to work for Epstein, according to the police report.

Police said they learned of these women by searching Epstein's trash, through surveillance of his property and his private jet, and by reviewing telephone message books retrieved during a warrant search of the house.

Epstein's spokesman, Sean Cassidy, said Epstein would have no comment for this story. Cassidy and Goldberger declined to answer questions. But Goldberger said in a prepared statement that "the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the Palm Beach County state attorney's office questioned the credibility of the witnesses."

The statement also said that "a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr. Epstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute."

Goldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph examiner, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police search of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations, Goldberger said.

Solicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-degree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses, said Mike Edmonson, spokesman for State Attorney Barry K. Johnson.

After completing its investigation, Palm Beach police turned the case over to Krischer's office several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be arrested on four counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation, all second-degree felonies.

Janet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the department handed the case to Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.

"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an arrest warrant with the State Attorney's Office, which we did," Kinsella said.

But rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before the grand jury.

Police Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he suggested in a May 1 memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case. Reiter said in

07/26/17

letters to the alleged victims and their parents that justice was not served by the indictment and that the case has been referred to the FBI to determine if federal laws were violated.

Edmondson said Krischer's office reviewed the police evidence and decided to investigate further.

"The prosecutor looks at the witnesses and physical evidence from a broader view," Edmondson said. "Because of the nature of the allegations, in particular the lengthy sexual activity on part of the individuals and elements of financial reward to the individuals, the case was referred to the grand jury. The grand jury heard from law-enforcement officials and witnesses and reviewed all of the evidence before determining that the appropriate charge was felony solicitation of prostitution."

## Town returned donation

Before the police investigation began, Epstein had donated $90,000 to the department for an equipment purchase that was never made. The money was returned to Epstein on Monday, Finance Director Jane Struder said.

Epstein has been known to date top models and was once named by the New York Post as one of Manhattan's most eligible bachelors.

His rise to wealth has been characterized by some as mysterious. Epstein was a math teacher at Manhattan's posh Dalton School when he started handling the money of billionaire fashion czar Leslie Wexner, who owns The Limited, Victoria's Secret, Express and Henri Bendel.

He lives in a 21,000-square-foot Manhattan/mansion sold to Le Roy, a private residence, and owns a floor of aircraft, including a private Baking 700 lot. He used to take Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on a charity mission, according to media reports.

He also owns an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch in New Mexico and Little St. James, a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Epstein's Palm Beach home was appraised for tax purposes last year at $6.9 million.

He was one of the bidders on the Abe Gosman estate on North County Road, which eventually was sold to Donald Trump for more than $41 million in 2004.

In a March 2003 article in Vanity Fair, writer Vicky Ward described Epstein as a charming, enigmatic and calculating financier who accepts only billionaires as clients.

# WHAT THE PRESS CALLS 'EPSTEIN SEX SCANDAL' SOUNDS A BIT MORE I

— THU, JUL 27, 2006 —

Ok, we know we gave **Jeffrey Epstein** a minor bullet point in our little gossip round-up. But that's because we are just now going through The Smoking Gun report on the **Donald Trump** role model and fellow scumbag, who not only recently arrested for soliciting sex from a masseuse, but who, according to "a former houseman," received three massages a day from girls who appeared to be, at the most, sixteen or seventeen years old. In case you haven't seen it, things get much worse.

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

He also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had to "wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which had been left in a sink. Alfredo Rodriguez, a former house manager, told probers that he "knew" Epstein's masseuses were still in high school. Rodriguez also told of having to "wipe down" vibrators and sex toys post-massage and returning them to an armoire near Epstein's bed.

It gets worse. About 22 pages of allegedly underage girls traipsing in and out of the house and engaging in various sexual acts with Epstein worse. The affidavit from a 14 year old girl, who's name is being withheld, names **Haley Robinson** and **Sara Keller** as two of the girls involved in this sick story. We can't get into all the details here — we have neither the stomach nor the time to sort through the novella sized account of Epstein's alleged escapades. What did jump out at us, however, more than the egg-shaped penis or the photos of naked underage girls all over his house, was the part which accounts Epstein's alleged rape of a sixteen year old girl. (Yes, all sex with a minor is rape, but this involves the girl screaming "No!" and Epstein paying her $1,000 after "forcibly holding her down on the table.")

[Withheld] stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. [Withheld] stated during one visit to Epstein's house in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend Nada Marcinkova was also present. [Withheld] provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each other's

breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Toward te end of this massage, Epstein grabbed [withheld] and turned her over onto her stomach on the massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. [Withheld] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [Withheld] became very upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump inside of her. She screamed "No!" and Epstein stopped. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for that visit.

Umm, can you say really, really fucked up? Read the thing for yourself, if you care to, but we just felt it necessary to point out that this story is more than lube and vibrators and massages. This is like, allegedly, really messed up stuff. And we are more than astounded at the press for not bringing these accusations to light. Very, very disappointing. Maybe since he's friends with Bill Clinton, Ron Burkle, and Donald Trump, accusations that he's raping little girls can be omitted from the news.

# Billionaire In Palm Beach Sex Scandal

Investigators: Moneyman Jeffrey Epstein solicited teen masseuses

JULY 26--Prepare to take a shower after reading this remarkably sleazy probable cause affidavit filed in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who was arrested Sunday for soliciting sex from a masseuse at his Florida mansion. Beginning in mid-March 2005, Epstein became the target of a sexual battery probe conducted by the Palm Beach Police Department, according to the affidavit, which alleges that Epstein, 53, paid a series of underage girls to engage in sexual activity with him. Frankly, there are too many dirty details in the affidavit to properly synopsize, but, if investigators are to be believed, Epstein has a thing for teenagers, vibrators, and assorted massage lotions. Epstein, pictured above in a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office mug shot, has been indicted on a felony solicitation of prostitution rap. The indictment, which does not allege that the solicited was a minor, charges that the crime occurred between August 2004 and Oct 2005. In a statement, Epstein's lawyer dismissed the affidavit's charges a "false accusations." Jose Alessi, a former houseman, told cops that Epstein would receive three massages daily and that his masseuses were "younger and younger" and "appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most also reported that following Epstein massages he sometimes had to "wash of massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis" which had been left in a sink.

called the moneyman a "terrific guy" who "likes beautiful women as much as and many of them are on the younger side."

# Jeffrey Epstein craved big homes, elite friends and, investigators say, underage girls

By ANDREW MARRA, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

**WINGED GARGOYLES** guarded the gate at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Inside, hidden cameras trolled two rooms, while the girls came and went.

For the police detectives who sifted through the garbage outside and kept records of visitors, it was the lair of a troubling target.

Epstein, one of the most mysterious of the country’s mega-rich, was known as much for his secrecy as for his love of fine things: magnificent homes, private jets, beautiful women, friendships with the world’s elite.

But at Palm Beach police headquarters, he was becoming known for something else: the regular arrival of teenage girls he hired to give him massages and, police say, perform sexual favors.

Epstein was different from most sexual abuse suspects; he was far more powerful. He counted among his friends former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, along with some of the most prominent legal, scientific and business minds in the country.

asking questions and teenage girls started talking, a wave of legal resistance followed.

If Palm Beach police didn’t know quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they found out soon enough.

Epstein, now 53, was a quintessential man of mystery. He amassed his fortune and friends quietly, always in the background as he navigated New York high society.

When he first attracted notice in the early 1990s, it was on account of the woman he was dating: Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell.

In a lengthy article, headlined “The Mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s Secret Love,” the British Mail on Sunday tabloid laid out speculative stories that the socialite’s beau was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a concert pianist or a corporate headhunter.

“But what is the truth about him?” the newspaper wondered. “Like Maxwell, Epstein is both flamboyant and intensely private.”

The media frenzy did not begin in full until a decade later. In September 2002, Epstein was flung into the limelight when he flew Clinton and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private jet.

Suddenly everyone wanted to know who Epstein was. New York magazine and Vanity Fair published lengthy profiles. The New York Post listed him as one of the city’s most eligible bachelors and began describing him in its gossip columns with adjectives such as “mysterious” and “reclusive.”

Although Epstein gave no interviews, the broad strokes of his past started to come into focus.

## Building a life of extravagance

He was born blue-collar in 1953, the son of a New York City parks department employee, and raised in Brooklyn’s Coney Island neighborhood. He left college without a bachelor’s degree but became a

fuel extraordinary desires.

In March 2005, a worried mother contacted Palm Beach police. She said another parent had overheard a conversation between their children.

Now the mother was afraid her 14-year-old daughter had been molested by a man on the island.

The phone call triggered an extensive investigation, one that would lead detectives to Epstein but leave them frustrated.

Palm Beach police and the state attorney's office have declined to discuss the case. But a Palm Beach police report detailing the criminal probe offers a window into what detectives faced as they sought to close in on Epstein.

Detectives interviewed the girl, who told them a friend had invited her to a rich man's house to perform a massage. She said the friend told her to say she was 18 if asked. At the house, she said she was paid $300 after stripping to her panties and massaging the man while he masturbated.

## Police interview 5 alleged victims

The investigation began in full after the girl identified Epstein in a photo as the man who had paid her. Police arranged for garbage trucks to set aside Epstein's trash so police could sift through it. They set up a video camera to record the comings and goings at his home. They monitored an airport hangar for signs of his private jet's arrivals and departures.

They quickly learned that the woman who took the 14-year-old girl to Epstein's house was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach Community College student from Loxahatchee. In a sworn statement at police headquarters, Robson, then 18, admitted she had taken at least six girls to visit Epstein, all between the ages of 14 and 16. Epstein paid her for each visit, she said.

During the drive back to her house, Robson told detectives, "I'm like a Heidi Fleiss."

enough dirt on the girls to make prosecutors skeptical. Not only did some of the girls have issues with drugs or alcohol but also some had criminal records and other troubles, Epstein's legal team claimed. And at least one of them, they said, lied when she told police she was younger than 18 when she started performing massages for Epstein.

After the meeting, prosecutors postponed their decision to take the case to a grand jury.

In the following weeks, police received complaints that two of the victims or their families had been harassed or threatened. Epstein's legal team maintains that its private investigators did nothing illegal or unethical during their research.

By then, relations between police and prosecutors were fraying. At a key meeting with prosecutors and the defense, Detective Joseph Recarey, the lead investigator, was a no-show, according to Epstein's attorney.

"The embarrassment on the prosecutor's face was evident when the police officer never showed up for the meeting," attorney Jack Goldberger said.

Later in April, Recarey walked into a prosecutor's office at the state attorney's office and learned the case was taking an unexpected turn.

The prosecutor, Lanna Belohlavek, told Recarey the state attorney's office had offered Epstein a plea deal that would not require him to serve jail time or receive a felony conviction.

Recarey told her he disapproved of the plea offer.

The deal never came to pass, however.

## Future unclear after charge

On May 1, the department asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Epstein on four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and to charge his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged role in arranging the visits. Police

math teacher at the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan.

The story goes that the father of one of Epstein's students was so impressed with the man that he put him in touch with a senior partner at Bear Stearns, the global investment bank and securities firm.

In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a job at Bear Stearns. By the early 1980s, he had started J. Epstein and Co. That is when he began making his millions in earnest.

Little is known or said about Epstein's business except this: He manages money for the extremely wealthy. He is said to handle accounts only of $1 billion or greater.

It has been estimated he has roughly 15 clients, but their identities are the subject of only speculation. All except for one: Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited retail chain and a former Palm Beacher who is said to have been a mentor to Epstein.

Wexner sold Epstein one of his most lavish residences: a massive townhouse that dominates a block on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It is reported to have, among its finer features, closed-circuit television and a heated sidewalk to melt away fallen snow.

That townhouse, thought to be the largest private residence in Manhattan, is only a piece of the extravagant world Epstein built over time.

In New Mexico, he constructed a 27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion on a 10,000-acre ranch outside Santa Fe. Many believed it to be the largest home in the state.

In Palm Beach, he bought a waterfront home on El Brillo Way. And he owns a 100-acre private island in the Virgin Islands.

Perhaps as remarkable as his lavish homes is his extensive network of friends and associates at the highest echelons of power. This includes not only socialites but also business tycoons, media moguls, politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-winning scientists whose research he often funds.

"Just like other people collect art, he collects scientists," said Martin Nowak, who directs the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University and was reportedly the recipient of a $30 million research donation from Epstein.

Epstein is said to have befriended former Harvard President Larry Summers, prominent law Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald Trump and New York Daily News Publisher Mort Zuckerman.

And yet he managed for decades to maintain a low profile. He avoids eating out and was rarely photographed.

"The odd thing is I never met him," said Dominick Dunne, the famous chronicler of the trials and tribulations of the very rich. "I wasn't even aware of him," except for a Vanity Fair article.

Epstein's friendship with Clinton has attracted the most attention.

Epstein met Clinton as early as 1995, when he paid tens of thousands of dollars to join him at an intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm Beach. But from all appearances, they did not become close friends until after Clinton left the Oval Office and moved to New York.

Epstein has donated more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates' campaigns, including John Kerry's presidential bid; the reelection campaign of New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and the Senate bids of Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer.

# Powerful friends and enemies

A Vanity Fair profile found cracks in the veneer of Epstein's life story. The 2003 article said he left Bear Stearns in the wake of a federal probe and a possible Securities and Exchange Commission violation. It also pointed out that Citibank once sued him for defaulting on a $20 million loan.

The article suggested that one of his business mentors and previous employers was Steven Hoffenberg, now serving a prison term after "bilking investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history."

As he amassed his wealth, Epstein made enemies in disputes both large and small. He sued the man who in 1990 sold him his multimillion-dollar Palm Beach home over a dispute about less than $16,000 in furnishings.

In October, police searched the Palm Beach mansion. They discovered photos of naked, young-looking females, just as several of the girls had described in interviews. Hidden cameras were found in the garage area and inside a clock on Epstein's desk, alongside a girl's high school transcript.

Two of Epstein's former employees told investigators that young-looking girls showed up to perform massages two or three times a day when Epstein was in town.

They said the girls were permitted many indulgences. A chef cooked for them. Workers gave them rides and handed out hundreds of dollars at a time.

One employee told detectives he was told to send a dozen roses to one teenage girl after a high school drama performance. Others were given rental cars. One, according to police, received a $200 Christmas bonus.

The cops moved to cement their case. But as they tried to tighten the noose, they encountered other forces at work.

In Orlando they interviewed a possible victim who told them nothing inappropriate had happened between her and Epstein. They asked her whether she had spoken to anyone else. She said yes, a private investigator had asked her the same questions.

When they subpoenaed one of Epstein's former employees, he told them the same thing. He and a private eye had met at a restaurant days earlier to go over what the man would tell investigators.

Detectives received complaints that private eyes were posing as police officers. When they told Epstein's local attorney, Guy Fronstin, he said the investigators worked for Roy Black, the high-powered Miami lawyer who has defended the likes of Rush Limbaugh and William Kennedy Smith.

While the private eyes were conducting a parallel investigation, Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, traveled to West Palm Beach with information about the girls. From their own profiles on the popular Web site MySpace.com, he obtained copies of their discussions about their use of alcohol and marijuana.

He took his research to a meeting with prosecutors in early 2006, where he sought to cast doubt on the teens' reliability.

The private eyes had dug up

officials also wanted to charge Robson, the self-described Heidi Fleiss, with lewd and lascivious acts.

By then, the department was frustrated with the way the state attorney's office had handled the case. On the same day the warrants were requested, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter to State Attorney Barry Krischer suggesting he disqualify himself from the case if he would not act.

Two weeks later, Recarey was told that prosecutors had decided once again to take the case to the grand jury.

It is not known how many of the girls testified before the grand jury. But Epstein's defenseteam said one girl who was subpoenaed — the one who said she had sexual intercourse with Epstein — never showed up.

The grand jury's indictment was handed down in July. It was not the one the police department had wanted.

Instead of being slapped with a charge of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, Epstein was charged with one count of felony solicitation of prostitution, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. He was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail early July 23 and released hours later.

Epstein's legal team "doesn't dispute that he had girls over for massages," Goldberger said. But he said their claims that they had sexual encounters with him lack credibility.

"They are incapable of being believed," he said. "They had criminal records. They had accusations of theft made against them by their employers. There was evidence of drug use by some of them."

What remains for Epstein is yet to be seen.

The Palm Beach Police Department has asked the FBI to investigate the case. It also has returned the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.

In New York, candidates for governor and state attorney general have vowed to return a total of at least $60,000 in campaign contributions from Epstein. Meanwhile, Epstein's powerful friends have remained silent as tabloids and Internet blogs feast on the public details of the police investigation.

Goldberger maintains Epstein's innocence but says the legal team has not ruled out a future plea deal. He insists Epstein will emerge in the end with his reputation untarnished.

"He will recover from this," he said.

Staff writer Larry Keller and staff researchers Bridget Burr, Angelica Cortez, Amy Hanausyn &amp; Melanie Mena contributed to the story.
