as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Hugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It's based in large part on the timeline you sent.

Is there any reason why this information shouldn't be released to the public?

On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.

On July 29th Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at MCC-New York after daily interaction with him and according to established procedures. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9th. In addition, the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

On August 9th at about 8:00 a.m., Epstein's cellmate was taken out of the institution for a Court appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return to the institution. On August 9th, Epstein was in a legal visit with his lawyers all day until 6:45 p.m. Epstein returned to cell with no cellmate even though Epstein was on PSYCH Alert which included a requirement that he have a cellmate. No cellmate was assigned to his cell on August 9th.

On August 10th at about 12:00 a.m., while in his cell, Epstein acknowledged a Correction Officer performing a routine check. After midnight, it appears that not all of the checks required to be performed were actually done.

On August 10th at approximately 6:33 a.m., Staff serving breakfast meal found Epstein unresponsive in his cell. Staff called for assistance and began CPR. When EMS arrived at the institution, he was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:36am.

For sake of speed, and I decided for me to pass along to you quickly this very rough draft for the second inquiry pertaining to MCC NY below for you to review and edit as needed and send back to or NERO review (just like the last email and will get back to me). To be sure I'm clear, as background do you know if AW Skipper Scott &amp; case manager will get back to me? as needed? were working at MCC NY before Epstein's death or anything the reporter might be wondering about them (feel free to not answer if part of the Epstein investigation, I'm ignorant of names involved):

# Question from Fox News:

Hi there can you confirm whether case manager is still working with SHU inmates at MCC or has he been transferred to a different caseload, unit or facility after Jeffrey Epstein death? Also can you confirm the status of Assistant Warden Shirley Skipper Scott?

I was speaking on the phone with [name redacted] whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction.

[name redacted] informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated the Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.

I made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert. Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is between you and them and not my business.

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

Thanks, I figured I better just make sure (but I didn't think you were). I couldn't reach bosses. They will probably just reply thanks for awareness later.

For sake of speed [8081; d1073C] and I decided for me to pass along to you quickly this very rough draft for the second inquiry pertaining to MCC NY below for you to review and edit as needed and send back to [8081; d1073C] for NERO review (just like the last email and [8081; d1073C] will get back to me). To be sure I'm clear, as background do you know if AW Skipper Scott &amp; case manager [8081; d1073C] are working at MCC NY before Epstein's death or anything the reporter might be wondering about them (feel free to not answer if part of the Epstein investigation, I'm ignorant of names involved):

Question from Fox News:

Hi there can you confirm whether case manager [8081; d1073C] still working with SHU inmates at MCC or has he been transferred to a different caseload, unit or facility after Jeffrey Epstein death? Also can you confirm the status of Assistant Warden Shirley Skipper Scott?

Here are 3 recent answers we sent to media asking questions related to Epstein:

We decline to comment as the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.

The Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General. As such, we cannot answer questions relating to the investigation.

We decline to comment as the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General. We can, however, point to previous published reports indicating the New York Medical Examiner's Office has ruled the death a suicide.

A couple of days ago [link: d077C] requested documents and I forwarded it to you in an e-mail [link: d077C] is requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post orders, I think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on inmate Epstein signed for the quarter."

Good morning all. I apologize I was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. I was speaking on the phone with [link: d077C] whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction.

[link: d077C] informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated the Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugh Hurwitz 8/12/2019 1:17 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;

Please review for accuracy before I send to
[SURG. BUFF. BCC]

here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no p kans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.
7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

Good morning all. I apologize I was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. I was speaking on the phone wit[link: (b375C)] whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction.

[link: (b375C)] informed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. I had recently updated the Psychological Observation Procedural Memorandum which I will attach here. I have not updated the SW supplement for several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.

Also[link: (b375C)] is requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post orders, I think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on inmate Epstein signed for the quarter.

Thanks!

As discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse [body, doi:7,6,0] saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse [body, doi:7,6,0]

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

[body, doi:7,6,0]

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (808) (807) saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I info

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today.

Thanks,

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

# Epstein arrival at MCC

Subject: Epstein arrival at MCC
Attachments: TEXT.htm

Here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no plans had been established).
7/7/19: Warden identified him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.
7/8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse@bop.gov saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.

Please review for accuracy before I send to (b)(6); (b)(7)(C)

(b)(6)
(b)(7)(C) here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no p kans had been established).
7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.
7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

As discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

***Inmate Message Below***

I just spoke with an inmate who came out of the SHU last night. His room was directly next to Epstein's and was anxious to describe the night of his neighbor's death. Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed himself. Any conspiracy theories to the contrary are ridiculous actually heard Jeffrey tearing up his sheet before committing suicide. I asked if the SHU had been extraordinarily noisy and uncivilized as a prelude to Jeffrey killing himself. He responded in the negative - effectively refuting my theory that Epstein couldn't take the animals in the SHU and chose to end it as a result. I no longer believe that rooming with Jeffrey would have saved him. He wanted to kill himself and seized the opportunity when it was available (when his bunky moved out). Such is life - or death in this case.

Friday is my home confinement date and clearly, the staff hasn't done its job although the law specifically states that the BOP is required to let all inmates with the appropriate risks and needs (which I am) serve 10% of their sentences at home. I know this isn't part of your domain. But anything you could do to get me out of here when the law says I should be released (two days from now) would be most appreciated.

Hi Basic doi7303 I'm not sure if you've already relocated but I'm hoping you can help or redirect me to someone who can. I have a private investigator we have appointed under CJA coming to visit our client from out of town next week Monday and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to come in with us for a legal visit? Thank you.

bɔːrɔːd s discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

I have a private investigator we have appointed under CJA coming to visit our client from out of town next week Monday and Tuesday. What do we need to do to get him permission to come in with us for a legal visit? Thank you.

Please review for accuracy before I send to
[8081; d0173C]

Here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no p kans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden identified him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

He said his cellmate is up all night talking which keeps him awake. When I offered to request a new cellmate for him, he stated he will try staying with his current cellmate 3 to 4 more days and will let staff know if it is getting too difficult.

Please review for accuracy before I send to [RUE: 01730]

[RUE: 01730] here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no p kans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner.

Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to [t(0)t(; 0)t(7)c(] about the toilet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shirley V. Skipper-Scott [t(0)t(; 0)t(7)c(]: @bop.gov&gt; 7/28/2019 7:51 AM &gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse [t(0)t(; 0)t(7)c(] aw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse [t(0)t(; 0)t(7)c(]

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

If you are emailing about an inmate that may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact (verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist. Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of the inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I've seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

As discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Here is an updated version for the moment

NY DAILY NEWS

Questions &amp; Proposed Responses:

Page 9019

Page 1748

Hello, I'm working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against [8081; 8071G] I've spoken to an AFGE union official and [8081; 8071G] defense attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I'd appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide.

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein's death?

[805]

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein's suicide?

[805]

(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein's suicide?

[805] [8081; 8071G]

(4) Is it correct that [8081; 8071G] were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the suicide?

[805]

(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it's available.)

[805] [8081]

Page 9020

Page 1749

(6) Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges? What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?

Please review for accuracy before I send to b261 (6372C)

b261 (6372C) here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no pkans had been established).
7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.
7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugh Hurwitz 8/12/2019 1:17 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;

Please review for accuracy before I send to

Rok: here is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no p kans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from court of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

AW Skipper-Scott,

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see him again.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours.

He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (B)(B), (B)(7)(C) saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse (B)(B), (B)(7)(C)

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC. I've seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

RU as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So

# Epstein arrival at MCC

Subject: Epstein arrival at MCC

Attachments: TEXT.htm

[web:doi720]ere is a timeline of his arrival at the MCC:

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no plans had been established).

7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.

7/8/19: Upon return from Court, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.

7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only received one meal, a sand. Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that again because he stated he had mail to (8081:00375C) about the toilet.

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse (8081:00375C) saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed.

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today.

Thanks

Hello, I’m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against . I’ve spoken to an AFGE union official an [defense attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.

The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.

(1) Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?

Hello

I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out on a story regarding Jeffrey Epstein's death. We have found a series of posts that were made on the website 4chan prior to any public announcement of Epstein's death. The first post was made at 8:15 AM and the subsequent posts described in detail the first responders' actions. The first news report about Epstein's death was at roughly 9 AM.

I've pasted one of the posts below.

![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

Can you verify the accuracy of what's been posted? Would speaking publicly about an inmate's death break any procedures? If so, does MCC plan to take any action on the matter or investigate it?

Please get back to me as soon as possible today.

Thank you,

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.

It is discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner.

Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to @bdp.doi/7/6/01 about the toilet

AW Skipper-Scott,

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,

Can you not just move him to another cell? He will not have lunch in Attorney Conference. He will go back to his cell to eat. He knows this.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only received one meal, a sand. Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that again because he stated he had to mail to (dod: do) (c) about the toilet.

7/6/19: Arrived at NYM (Saturday) in the Receiving and Discharge area. Moved by staff to general population (apparently USMS did not indicate that he was a high profile inmate and staff were unaware that he was coming so no pkans had been established).
7/7/19: Warden idenfied him as high profile and moved him to Special Housing Unit due to his concerns for his personal safety in general population.
7/8/19: Upon return of Psych Svc Staff on Monday, he was moved to Psychology Observation for evaluation by Psych Svc Staff. This is NOT suicide watch and the system notes reflect suicide watch not warranted. He was under 24 hour observation during this time to assess his readiness to move to SHU.
7/10/19: Returned to SHU with cell mate. Remains until 7/23.

This appears consistent with PDS. The one edit I suggest based on PDS is to delete the text I colored red and replace it with the green. PDS reflects he was placed in Psyc Observation that night after he returned from court and was assessed the next morning.

AW Skipper-Scott,

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see him again.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he so

He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise of inmates banging

AW Skipper-Scott,

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see him again.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours.

He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.

Dear Warden N'Diaye,

Thank you for your letter of August 10, 2019 regarding the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. Epstein’s death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case.

One open question, among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019. To my knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded about that incident.

Sincerely,
Richard M. Berman

Suicide Watch

TEXT.htm

Page 2071

A couple of issues came out of the Epstein Reconstruction which I wanted to problem solve when you have an opportunity to meet:

$o5

## Other issues regarding the SW program:

1. We need to ensure the Unit 2 Officer is making rounds each hour and signing the log book. While the officer is back there, if an inmate companion needs to utilize the bathroom he should be allowed to do so. Inmate Companions have been urinating in the garbage cans out of desperation.

2. Inmates on suicide watch need to be fed as timely as possible.

3. Inmates on suicide watch need to receive showers on M, W, and F.

4. Suicide Watch mattresses are being taken from our area to be used in GP. They are specialized and expensive mattresses.

5. If my orderly brings dirty smocks to the elevator, can internal bring them to the laundry in the basement? Dirty Smocks are getting misplaced or thrown away.

6. Lt.'s need to strip out the inmate going on suicide watch and thoroughly search the inmate companions coming down for contraband and inappropriate items. If the inmate companions bring down contraband for the inmates on Suicide Watch, they will be terminated.

7. Lt.' need to search the suicide watch room before inmates go into the room on suicide watch.

8. Lt.'s need to ensure inmates on suicide watch are placed in a smock without clothing, glasses, etc. unless otherwise indicated by a psychologist and with on the front of the log book.

hi hi

hope you are well. We saw an article tonight on something called Radaronline reporting that Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit suicide at the MCC (unsuccessfully.)

Are you in a position to help me on that with some sort of confirmation or information. (Or to dispel its veracity?) thanks, 0

Good Morning:

I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference?

Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate?

Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service every morning.

Please provide a response.

Thank You,

Also, the two officers that we are putting on AL, one is scheduled off today already and the other didn't show (so far). So the urgency of putting them on AL is less if they are not there. Ray is checking on the schedule of the others.

Good Morning:

I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference?

Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate?

Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service every morning.

Please provide a response.

Thank You,

bob; b072C) prry to bother you with this:

Update: We got over 30 inquiries. My boss is drafting a very short answer that will probably say we don't comment on an inmate's health status or conditions of confinement for privacy reasons.

My boss had me call MCC NY just now to be sure they are not releasing varying statements to the media, we want the institution &amp; me to use the same exact statement to all media (we'll give them the statement we come up with shortly and be sure they're fine with it) and they just told me you're acting will call me back shortly.

Last thing - I didn't realize he went to the hospital, I might ask your acting exec. if he's still at the hospital or how long there, etc., if that's true (news article say he went to a hospital).

hope you are well. We saw an article tonight on something called Radaronline reporting that Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit suicide at the MCC (unsuccessfully.)

Subject: Epstein #76318-054 Medical/Mental Health Records
Attachments: TEXT.htm, Certification of Identify Form.pdf
Good morning [draft: 00:17:52]

I spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's subpoena is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death in this context. Once I receive the certification, letter, and subpoena, I will have the USAO's Civil Division authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) and the associated regulations.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.

Thank you,

Hugh,

1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA.
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding more information.
(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP's response to the union's contention is staffing shortages is at the root of the problem?

3. The second attachment is a collection of data Psychology Services does every year. 2018 and 2017 will likely have one more death added to each year. This were discovered this week, one at CAA and one at an RRC that PSB was never notified about.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hugh Hurwitz 8/23/2019 10:39 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;
Can I get any historical info you have? Thanks.

Answer sent to WA Post on 8/21/2019 (finalized by IPPA leadership after consulting 0081:0072C)

The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The BOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate's arrival at each BOP facility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.08 "Suicide Prevention Program" here https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5324_008.pdf and BOP Program Statement 5310.17 "Psychology Services Manual" here https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5310_017.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical staff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place an inmate on suicide watch.

The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral, assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects, materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are evaluated daily by psychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions. Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.

With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654 correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. The BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.

The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.

The safety of staff, inmates, and the public is the highest priority for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The BOP has an extensive Suicide Prevention Program that begins upon an inmate’s arrival at each BOP facility, including pretrial facilities such as MCC New York. See BOP Program Statement 5324.08 "Suicide Prevention Program" here https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5324_008.pdf and BOP Program Statement 5310.17 "Psychology Services Manual" here https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5310_017.pdf. During the initial intake screening by medical staff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place an inmate on suicide watch.

The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral, assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects, materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are evaluated daily by psychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions. Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.

With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654 correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.

The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a

Good morning,

In wake of the Epstein death, I understand that institutions across the bureau are designating specific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations where inmates are at some risk for suicide.

Is there someone who may be able to elaborate on this effort?

Many thanks,

Thanks to Hugh for clarifying this. Upon reflection, I agree it really is probably only about the CPD rounds issue.

I'm walking down to CPD now to see if they can improve my new draft answer below.

I'm walking down to CPD to see if I can find someone in your absence who can review my new, very rough draft answer below, which AD Hurwitz says is best answered by CPD and not RSD. Accordingly, I eliminated my prior (long) draft answer that had input from RSD.

# Inmate Suicide Prevention Memo

From (date: 01/17/2020)
To Hugh Hurwitz
Date 2019/10/17 13:40
Subject: Inmate Suicide Prevention Memo
Attachments: TEXT.htm

Hugh,

Wanted to give you the heads up, there is an Inmate Suicide Prevention Program Memo in your mailbox that you will probably want to review tomorrow. I discussed it with (date: 01/17/2020) today.

Basically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. (date: 01/17/2020) is in the office tomorrow, 10/18, if you want to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions. Have a great day. Peace- (date: 01/17/2020)

Warden,

Per our discussion, please see the below request for a tour of the SHU and suicide watch areas by the US Attorney and his staff Thursday, August 15. I will try to arrange it for 10 am, but we may be subject to the US Attorney's schedule. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

The list of visitors from our office is below:

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge

# Reason for Referral and Identifying Information

Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manage for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555.

# Background Information

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by do8; do7;c: "Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time."

According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by do8; do7;c: "Inmate Epstein denied any past or present suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the past."

do7;c

# Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.

# Clinical Impression

According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by do8; do7;c: "No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current."

# Findings

The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent.

# Recommendations Regarding Sanctions

In the case of inmate Epstein, after a review of available psychological and psychiatric records as well as information pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is:

(X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process.
( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for an updated competency assessment in 30 days.
( ) NOT COMPETENT and not likely to become competent.

# Focus of Session

He was seen by writer while he was on Psych Observation.

# Subjective/Objective Presentation

He stated he hasn't slept well at MCC-NY because he hasn't had his cpap machine. He stated it is here and he will be able to start using it tonight. He discussed how he does not think he will be able to sleep in SHU and how he does not like SHU because of the noise. He discussed issues on not getting some medication with Medical today.

The "Eating/Shower Chart" indicated yesterday he ate breakfast and dinner, drank liquids, and took a shower when offered and so far today it noted he ate breakfast and drank liquids. The Psych Observation Log noted he slept, drank water, went to legal, and talked to an Inmate Companion about investments.

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts.

# Intervention(s)

Supportive and educative interventions were provided. When asked about the Turning Point handouts for coping in SHU, he stated he already knows these strategies before he read the handouts and had tried them when he was in SHU the last time. He stated with the noise in SHU, he said the strategies will not work. He was encouraged to try them.

# Progress/Plan

The Chief Psychologist was consulted. Psych Observation will be discontinued. Mr. Epstein was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology staff. He will be seen in follow up by Psychology tomorrow to monitor his mental status and to provide further intervention if needed and he was informed that he will be seen by Psychology tomorrow. In the meantime, he was encouraged to self-refer to Psychology if needed to which he agreed and seems capable of doing. If he remains in SHU, he will be seen by Psychology in SHU Rounds and in SHU Reviews. The SHU Lt. was informed that Mr. Epstein needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.

# Focus of Session

Inmate Epstein was seen while on psychological observation today in the hospital area.

# Subjective/Objective Presentation

Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. B373A

B373A

I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because B373A

B373A

or more comfortable for him. B373A

According to his log book and eating/shower chart, he has been eating and drinking when not in his legal visits. He has also been writing and attending his legal visits.

# Intervention(s)

Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was somewhat receptive to these interventions, but appears more concerned about getting his various needs in the prison (phone calls, recreation, housing placement concerns, etc.)

# Progress/Plan

He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. He will be seen by psychology daily to assess his mental status and psychological functioning.

# Focus of Session

He was seen by writer while he was on Psych Observation.

# Subjective/Objective Presentation

The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 hours per day because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect all of his meals. He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept.

Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse  srs@; do7aC) from Medical had seen him for this.

When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse  srs@; do7aC)

He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers.

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts.

# Intervention(s)

Supportive and educative interventions were again provided. He had not been given the Turning Point handouts yesterday that were on his cell door, so they were handed to him by staff today.

# Progress/Plan

He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.

He said he has an appetite and is eating. He said he is waking up every 1 1/2 hours. He stated he feels dehydrated because he is not drinking enough water because he stated he feels he is not given enough bathroom breaks while with his Attorney. Medical was e-mailed with his complaint of feeling dehydrated. He said his Lawyers and friends are all emotionally supportive.

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a madly full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, or substantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation. He stated "I'm a coward." He added he does not like pain and even does not like when he has to give blood. He agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts.

# Intervention(s)

Supportive and educative interventions were provided. He was given Turning Points handouts on stress management, sleep, and building a routine in SHU. He stated he wants it noted in his chart that he is being given a pamphlet on sleep, but that is not going to help because of the noise in SHU that prevents him from sleeping.

He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.

b|i|7|iA

b|i|7|iA] When this writer attempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have such impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood my position.

Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it "a punishment cell." He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong.

He stated he has not received the phone calls he was promised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the attorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed the times when staff members have attempted to give him phone calls and recreation.

Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating "I am too vested in my case to fight it, I have a life and I want to go back to living my life." He denied any acute symptoms at this time.

According to his log book, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has also been attending his daily legal visits.

## Reason for Removal from Watch

Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "I have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr. EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.

Nonetheless, Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein returned from court after duty hours yesterday evening and staff notified the on-call psychologist.

He has never received inpatient or outpatient mental health treatment and denied any history of suicidality. Currently, he does not exhibit any acute psychopathology, is currently psychologically stable and is in no psychological distress. As such, he is being classified as a CC1-MH inmate at this time.

# Care Level Formulation

CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who shows no significant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and demonstrates no need for regular mental health intervention.

Inmate Epstein did not exhibit any acute psychopathology and exhibited a clear mental status.

Current Mental Status: Mr. EPSTEIN was alert and oriented. He was polite, calm, and cooperative in demeanor. He exhibited a neutral affect with appropriate range. Eye contact and hygiene were appropriate. The inmate spoke with normal rate, tone, and volume. His thoughts were organized and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial, or irrelevant content. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance, delusional ideation, or a formal thought disorder. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He noted having normal sleeping and eating habits. Mr. EPSTEIN explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent. He was future-oriented and expressed a commitment to life and safety, agreeing to contact staff immediately should he experience suicidal ideation.

## RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ASSESSED:

This writer screened the inmate for a variety of empirically validated factors commonly associated with risk for self-harm and suicide.

The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate's risk for engaging in suicide related behaviors: High Profile Crime, Lack of family connections, Sex offender status

Of the DYNAMIC risk factors assessed, none were found to be present.

The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide: Able to identify reasons to live, Adequate problem solving skills, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Future orientation, View of death as negative, Willingness to engage in treatment

As noted above, Inmate Epstein is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with extensive media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this writer that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.

Despite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his attorney, to take a shower, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said "I have my paper spoon here." He reported he is going to have a bail hearing on Monday and believes he is going to be released from jail. Inmate Epstein reported he is a Banker and has a "big business" in the community and that "being alive is fun." He also revealed he enjoys learning and teaching. He has confidence in his attorney and described him as "competent." Inmate Epstein denied any mental health history or history of suicidality. He also reported none of his family members have mental health histories. Inmate Epstein stated he is a mathematician and took post graduate classes in this area of study. Inmate Epstein stated he has a support system in the community, including friends and other associates. Finally, inmate Epstein demonstrated a good sense of humor and did not appear dysphoric, agitated or anxious. No acute psychopathology was noted.

Overall, inmate Epstein has numerous protective factors at this time that outweigh his risk factors for suicidality. He has a positive outlook regarding his legal case, demonstrates no psychiatric symptoms, has no psychiatric or suicide history, and verbalized a desire to be alive at this time and future orientation.

## DIAGNOSIS:

## RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ASSESSED:

This writer screened the inmate for a variety of empirically validated factors commonly associated with risk for self-harm and suicide.

The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate's risk for engaging in suicide related behaviors: High Profile Crime, Lack of family connections, Sex offender status

Of the DYNAMIC risk factors assessed, none were found to be present.

The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide: Able to identify reasons to live, Adequate problem solving skills, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Future orientation, View of death as negative, Willingness to engage in treatment

As noted above, Inmate Epstein is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with extensive media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this writer that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.

Despite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a phone call, to meet with his attorney, to take a shower, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said "I have my paper spoon here." He reported he is going to have a bail hearing on Monday and believes he is going to be released from jail. Inmate Epstein reported he is a Banker and has a "big business" in the community and that "being alive is fun." He also revealed he enjoys learning and teaching. He has confidence in his attorney and described him as "competent." Inmate Epstein denied any mental health history or history of suicidality. He also reported none of his family members have mental health histories. Inmate Epstein stated he is a mathematician and took post graduate classes in this area of study. Inmate Epstein stated he has a support system in the community, including friends and other associates. Finally, inmate Epstein demonstrated a good sense of humor and did not appear dysphoric, agitated or anxious. No acute psychopathology was noted.

Overall, inmate Epstein has numerous protective factors at this time that outweigh his risk factors for suicidality. He has a positive outlook regarding his legal case, demonstrates no psychiatric symptoms, has no psychiatric or suicide history, and verbalized a desire to be alive at this time and future orientation.

## DIAGNOSIS:

&gt; Lee, I saw a story today claiming that BOP lost 12% of our workforce since Trump Administration started which is double the drop in the prison pop. This is highly misleading. As you know (and AG Sessions and DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration)! The drop in staffing that they are referring to also likely includes the 5156 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated...positions we never could fill in the first place.

&gt; We do not need more staff, we just need to fill the vacancies we have. I continue to point out to anyone that will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing levels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas. I have dozens of examples where we post jobs, get 30 applicants and only 10 end up actually coming on board. At that rate it will take a long time just to fill the vacancies we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try and make BOP more attractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help).

&gt; Anyway, I know you know this, but also want you to know that we are working to change this narrative, but right now we are getting drowned out by the media hysteria. Thanks.

Ok, this is going to be sensitive. Cant say I'm surprised people want to be cautious. I will want to hear about specific examples of significant problems. Why sending to RDs and not to all CEOs? All CEO memo will need Exec staff and union clearance first, but it will ensure the message gets out. We can discuss tomorrow.

Hugh,

Wanted to give you the heads up, there is an Inmate Suicide Prevention Program Memo in your mailbox that you will probably want to review tomorrow. I discussed it with today.

Basically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. is in the office tomorrow, 10/18, if you want to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions. Have a great day. Peace- 0081 (0x7xC)

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge.

I didn't read the press release. It's less about responding to CNN directly and more an opportunity to give DOJ some TPs to use to counter the narrative th have some TPs we can provide on that if we want. Either way, don't spend a ton of time on this, not sure they will use it.
