# Woman sues billionaire investor, says they had sex when she was 16

The Associated Press

NEW YORK — A billionaire investor, already facing jail in Palm Beach County on charges of soliciting underage prostitutes, is being sued by a young woman who says he had sex with her when she was 16 and had sought his help becoming a model.

The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, says financier Jeffrey Epstein had the teen perform a sex act when she brought photographs of herself for him to review in his Upper East Side mansion sometime in 2000.

Epstein

54, a money manager,

told the teen he managed finances for Victoria's Secret and "could get you into the catalog" if she were "nice" to him, court papers say. The papers say being "nice" included massages and other favors.

When the girl told Epstein, "I am 16 years old and just want to model," he replied, "Don't worry, I won't tell anybody," court papers say.

Epstein, said by London's

Mail on Sunday to be a close friend of England's Prince Andrew, has been indicted in Palm Beach on charges of soliciting underage prostitutes. That case is pending.

The girl visited Epstein "several times over the several months and engaged in bizarre and unnatural sex acts" while she was a minor, the lawsuit says.

Epstein "repeatedly requested that (the girl) return with her 14-, 15-, and 16-year-old girlfriends, stating, 'Come by with your friends your age next time. Don't bring Sherrie (a mutual friend in her 40s). I love girls your age.'"

The young woman, now 23, kept returning to Epstein because she has "mental issues," said her lawyer, William J. Unroch. He refused to elaborate, but court papers say she was "disabled as a result of severe mental disease and defect."

Epstein's lawyer in New York, Gerald Lefcourt, said, "The girl has admitted she is insane, but she can read a newspaper and recognize the word 'rich.'"

Lefcourt also said the statute of limitations has expired for the woman's case criminally and civilly, and will almost certainly be dismissed.

He refused to comment on Epstein's Florida charges.

Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, also acknowledged that his client was living with him and was at the center of a $10 million lawsuit he filed last year against a neighbor who said he was having sex with underage girls. That case is pending.

"What she was doing at 22 is irrelevant to what happened to her when she was 16," Unroch said Wednesday. He went on the say he hoped Epstein would agree to "do right" by his client and resolve the case out of court.

Damn... I just read about your near face accident. Glad you're alright and unscareful, close calls like that that make us thank you. I'm not very religious myself, but try a lot of things. The right thing. I was driving down south on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped out. It was so I know how you feel. The least thing I'd do is drive it down. The driver could have done was stopped, but I just want to be a leader. The least you didn't hit anything and are O

Damn... I just read about your near fatal accident. Glad you're alright and unscaved. It's close calls like that that make us thank god. I'm not very religious myself, but try and do the right thing. I was driving down south once on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped over on us so I know how you feel. The least that driver could have done was stopped, but at least you didn't hit anything and are OK.  |

Will looks so damn ridiculous in this picture. He looks like he got hit in the back of the head with a shovel, and now he's retarded. So the only place he can work is Wal-Mart. Or maybe he's just high.

Biker Bitch
Current mood: 😊 exhausted
Category: Automotive

I am sooooooooooooooo tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was sooooooooo cool! There was 400 bikes. It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

Current mood: 😊 crushed
Category: School, College, Greek

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for FSU on Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.

GGGRRRRRR,...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I was 'by the book' on EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$. I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definitely the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!!!!

rough times

Current mood: ☐ sad

Everything sucks right now.

My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.) The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank God she has me. I hope everything ends up being okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally stressed. I'm going through a really tough time. There's been so much death around me. It's really overwhelming.

Current mood: ☐ drained

Hey,

Wow! Not living with my parents anymore is da shit! For all of you who are not aware, I moved to Jacksonville. So far everything is going well. Will and I are getting along. Not like everyone predicted,..."oh when you guys live together all of that time together will be horrible,..." the complete opposite as a matter of fact :) I went job hunting the

second day that we were here but all I did was get applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this" and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired. Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores and Bath &amp; Body Works. I like my boss so far, I mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool. Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it. The boss guy called him back to set up an interview the day he came in with the application, I think that's a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right now. I got to call him and ask him how it went in a lil' while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS job and the lady called me back and told me that William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence that she didn't need to call anyone else back,...he got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound fucking great,.I lied and said that he was the old stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back home. i love you guys. Don't forget about me.
