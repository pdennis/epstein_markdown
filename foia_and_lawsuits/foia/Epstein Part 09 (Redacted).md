On March 15, 2005, The victim, a 14 year old female, reported to the Palm Beach Police Department that she was brought to 358 El Brillo Way, in Palm Beach, Jeffrey Epstein’s house for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity with to Epstein. This arrangement was organized by Haley Robson.

The victim advised she was aware that Robson was working for a subject, named “Jeff” who lived in Palm Beach. She was also aware that Robson had previously stated she did sexual favors for “Jeff” in the past. Robson had offered the victim an opportunity to make good money. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein.

During a sworn taped statement, the victim stated, on February 6, 2005, Haley Robson came to the victims house and picked the victim up. During the drive to Palm Beach, Robson told the victim that should “Jeff” ask her for her age, to state she was eighteen. Upon arriving at the house at 358 El Brillo they were allowed entry into the house. The victim was introduced to Epstein and was led upstairs to the bedroom area. Once inside the bedroom, the victim was instructed to wait for Epstein. Shortly thereafter, Epstein entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. Epstein instructed the victim to massage his back and laid naked on the massage table in his bedroom dropping the towel he had on. As the victim, began to massage Epstein on his back area, Epstein instructed her to remove her clothing. The victim, removed her clothing, remaining only in her bra and thong underwear. Epstein laid on the table naked and further told her to get up on his back to massage his back. The victim straddled his waist and massaged his back. The victim advised her buttocks were touching his buttocks.

Epstein turned over on his back, the victim was now standing beside him, and she massaged his chest. Epstein began masturbating himself while she rubbed his chest. The victim stated that as she was rubbing his chest, Epstein produced a purple vibrator and began to massage the victims vagina area with the vibrator. The victim stated Epstein ejaculated and wiped himself with the towel he had on previously. Epstein allegedly told the victim, that Haley Robson had worked for him for many years.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by Det. Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.

Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars. Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage. Robson stated “I know” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.

The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated simultaneously.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified, and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the victim’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.

It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate.

During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach. Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by Det. Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.

He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I know you’re not comfortable, but I’ll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked how many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she brought JS, Y L, and the victim in this case.

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On November 7, 2005, I made contact with [redacted] at her home. During a sworn taped statement, [redacted] stated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who wished to work for him. [redacted] stated she was offered to work for him but declined. [redacted] explained that “work” means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no. [redacted] said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein’s house to provide massages. [redacted] further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the request, just to tell him and he would stop. [redacted] stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim, [redacted] stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most. [redacted] further stated she did not know the victim personally. [redacted] stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.

As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts to a victim under the age of 16.

The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed before me this 20 day of September, 2005 by Det. Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.

## RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS

The top donations to gov. elect Bill Richardson's campaign came from:

1. **Labor unions: $633,488**

The top union donor was AFSCME, the public-employee's labor group, which gave $300,000 in cash contributions. AFSCME also produced its own radio and television ads during the Republican primary that were critical of GOP candidates.

AFSCME is angling to persuade the Legislature and the governor to reinstate collective bargaining for state employees. Outgoing Gov. Gary Johnson allowed the previous agreement to expire, and Richardson has promised to work on a new agreement.

The Communication Workers of America, which represents several thousand employees in New Mexico, contributed $100,000 through its political action committee in New Mexico. The American Federation of Teachers, one of two national teachers unions that represents New Mexico educators, gave $50,000.

2. **Gambling interests: $648,392**

This is a significant development in New Mexico campaign finances. In a matter of five years, gambling money has become one of the top influences in state politics.

The top gambling contributor was the Downs at Albuquerque, which donated $100,000.

The Downs has a relationship with the state because the racing license is regulated by the state Racing Commission. The Downs also

operates a casino that is regulated by the state Gaming Control Board.

The Downs also rents the racetrack and casino facilities from the New Mexico State Fair. The state recently sued the Downs on behalf of the State Fair for more than $100,000 in back rent that has not been paid.

Paul Blanchard, the president of the Downs, was a key player in helping Richardson raise campaign money. He donated $10,000 of his own money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace, also donated $10,000.

Other major gambling contributors include Riviera Gaming Management Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is working with partners in New Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get a license to open a horse racetrack and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated $50,000 to Richardson's campaign.

The Pueblo of Sandia contributed $56,148 in cash and in-kind donations to Richardson. Sandia operates the state's largest tribal casino.

3. Democratic organizations: $490,751

The Democratic Governors Association chipped in $427,500 to help elect Richardson. That amount was minor compared with the money the DGA funneled to gubernatorial candidates in more competitive races.

Nevertheless, the association was counting on Richardson, who was one of a half-dozen candidates who helped Democrats take control in states where Republicans had been chief executives.

Now, the DGA is turning to Richardson to serve as its top federal liaison. The former congressman and cabinet member will speak for Democratic governors during negotiations with the White

House and Congress on issues that affect states.

Richardson also attracted $51,000 from the New Democrat Network, a political group that embraces centrist Democrats.

Richardson also received $12,751 in cash from the state Democratic Party, although he contributed $350,000 from his account to help the party's coordinated campaign to elect Democrats.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

4. Richardson's congressional account: $289,315

Richardson transferred all of the money from the bank account he previously used for his congressional campaigns in the state's 3rd Congressional District in northern New Mexico.

Richardson had fought in court in the early 1990s for the right to transfer money from a federal campaign account to a state account, even though the state constitution bans the practice. The state Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional provision violated the federal constitution.

5. Peters Corporation: $138,376

Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend of Richardson.

In addition to $102,000 in cash contributions donated to the campaign, Peters also flew Richardson in his private plane during several campaign swings around the state. He also provided food and beverages for an event and donated art. Those in-kind contributions amounted to $35,000 in aid.

6. Jerry Perenchio, president of Univision: $116,667

Robson had offered the victim an opportunity to make good money. “Jeff” was later identified as Jeffrey Epstein.

During a sworn taped statement, the victim stated, on February 6, 2005, Haley Robson came to the victims house and picked the victim up. During the drive to Palm Beach, Robson told the victim that should “Jeff” ask her for her age, to state she was eighteen. Upon arriving at the house at 358 El Brillo they were allowed entry into the house. The victim was introduced to Epstein and was led upstairs to the bedroom area. Once inside the bedroom, the victim was instructed to wait for Epstein. Shortly thereafter, Epstein entered the bedroom wearing only a towel.

As the victim, began to massage Epstein on his back area, Epstein instructed her to remove her clothing. The victim, removed her clothing, remaining only in her bra and thong underwear. Epstein laid on the table naked and further told her to get up on his back to massage his back. The victim straddled his waist and massaged his back. The victim advised her buttocks were touching his buttocks.

Epstein turned over on his back, the victim was now standing beside him, and she massaged his chest. Epstein began masturbating himself while she rubbed his chest. The victim stated that as she was rubbing his chest, Epstein produced a purple vibrator and began to massage the victims vagina area with the vibrator.

Epstein instructed the victim to leave her telephone number before she left and paid her three hundred dollars. Epstein left the room as the victim began getting dressed. The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was waiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage. Robson stated “I know” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.

The victim was shown a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim immediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated simultaneously.

During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the Investigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 561-308-0282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an attempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The victim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Town of Palm Beach was notified, and trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the victim’s name at 11:00 am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.

It should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the description of the interior of the house was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which Epstein was the victim, and found the victims description of the house to be accurate.

During the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach. Robson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On November 7, 2005, I made contact with [redacted] at her home. During a sworn taped statement [redacted] stated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who wished to work for him. [redacted] stated she was offered to work for him but declined. [redacted] explained that “work” means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no. [redacted] said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein’s house to provide massages. [redacted] further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked. It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the request, just to tell him and he would stop [redacted] stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim, [redacted] stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most. [redacted] further stated she did not know the victim personally. [redacted] stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.

As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts to a victim under the age of 16.

# RICHARDSON'S CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS

The top donations to gov. elect Bill Richardson's campaign came from:

1. **Labor unions: $633,488**
The top union donor was AFSCME, the public-employee's labor group, which gave $300,000 in cash contributions. AFSCME also produced its own radio and television ads during the Republican primary that were critical of GOP candidates.

AFSCME is angling to persuade the Legislature and the governor to reinstate collective bargaining for state employees. Outgoing Gov. Gary Johnson allowed the previous agreement to expire, and Richardson has promised to work on a new agreement.

The Communication Workers of America, which represents several thousand employees in New Mexico, contributed $100,000 through its political action committee in New Mexico. The American Federation of Teachers, one of two national teachers unions that represents New Mexico educators, gave $50,000.

The Tribune Web site is updated by noon and as events warrant daily

2. **Gambling interests: $648,392**
This is a significant development in New Mexico campaign finances. In a matter of five years, gambling money has become one of the top influences in state politics.

The top gambling contributor was the Downs at Albuquerque, which donated $100,000.

The Downs has a relationship with the state because the racing license is regulated by the state Racing Commission. The Downs also

operates a casino that is regulated by the state Gaming Control Board.

The Downs also rents the racetrack and casino facilities from the New Mexico State Fair. The state recently sued the Downs on behalf of the State Fair for more than $100,000 in back rent that has not been paid.

Paul Blanchard, the president of the Downs, was a key player in helping Richardson raise campaign money. He donated $10,000 of his own money. Blanchard's wife, Kandace, also donated $10,000.

Other major gambling contributors include Riviera Gaming Management Inc., a Las Vegas corporation that is working with partners in New Mexico, including Ken Newton, to get a license to open a horse racetrack and casino in Hobbs. Riviera donated $50,000 to Richardson's campaign.

The Pueblo of Sandia contributed $56,148 in cash and in-kind donations to Richardson. Sandia operates the state's largest tribal casino.

3. Democratic organizations: $490,751

The Democratic Governors Association chipped in $427,500 to help elect Richardson. That amount was minor compared with the money the DGA funneled to gubernatorial candidates in more competitive races.

Nevertheless, the association was counting on Richardson, who was one of a half-dozen candidates who helped Democrats take control in states where Republicans had been chief executives.

Now, the DGA is turning to Richardson to serve as its top federal liaison. The former congressman and cabinet member will speak for Democratic governors during negotiations with the White

House and Congress on issues that affect states.

Richardson also attracted $51,000 from the New Democrat Network, a political group that embraces centrist Democrats.

Richardson also received $12,751 in cash from the state Democratic Party, although he contributed $350,000 from his account to help the party's coordinated campaign to elect Democrats.

![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)

4. Richardson's congressional account: $289,315

Richardson transferred all of the money from the bank account he previously used for his congressional campaigns in the state's 3rd Congressional District in northern New Mexico.

Richardson had fought in court in the early 1990s for the right to transfer money from a federal campaign account to a state account, even though the state constitution bans the practice. The state Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional provision violated the federal constitution.

5. Peters Corporation: $138,376

Gerald Peters, owner of the Peters Gallery in Santa Fe, is a close friend of Richardson.

In addition to $102,000 in cash contributions donated to the campaign, Peters also flew Richardson in his private plane during several campaign swings around the state. He also provided food and beverages for an event and donated art. Those in-kind contributions amounted to $35,000 in aid.

6. Jerry Perenchio, president of Univision: $116,667

Perenchio founded Univision, the Spanish-language TV network that broadcasts throughout the United

States. He also owns Chartwell Partners, a Los Angeles investment company.

Perenchio has actively supported candidates, mostly in California. He gave at least $200,000 to California Gov. Gray Davis during this election cycle. He also gave money to national Republican Congressional Committees and made smaller donations to Democratic congressional candidates.

Richardson has known Perenchio since his days in Congress.

7. Maloof family: $87,417
The high-profile New Mexico family, known for its support of Democratic candidates and causes, put its financial backing behind Richardson.

The Joe G. Maloof Company, the family's liquor business, pitched in $30,000. Gavin Maloof donated $40,000.

Family matriarch Colleen Maloof used her Albuquerque home and catered a fund-raising event - to the tune of $15,917 - on Richardson's behalf. Former Vice President Al Gore was the featured guest at the event.

The Maloofs own the Sacramento Kings basketball team and the Palms Casino and Resort in Las Vegas, Nev.

The Maloofs also donated a $1,500 trip to its Las Vegas resort as an auction item that Richardson used during a fund-raising event.

8. BGK Equities III LLC: $50,000
The Santa Fe real estate company is one of the largest commercial firms in the state.

Among its clients are state agencies, which lease office space from BGK.

9. **Cap II: $50,000**
The Albuquerque real estate company is owned by James Peterson of Peterson Properties Real Estate Services Inc.

Cap II leases properties to companies such as Walgreens Drug Stores Inc.

10. **Jeffrey E. Epstein: $50,000**
The New York City financier, who owns a ranch near Stanley, supported Richardson's campaign in New Mexico.

Epstein heads J. Epstein &amp; Co., a Manhattan money-management company. He built a mansion on the 100,000-acre Zorro Ranch he bought from former Gov. Bruce King's family in 1993.
