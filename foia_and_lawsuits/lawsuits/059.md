¹At the hearing held on February 4, 2020, while the Court did not allow the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands to intervene, the Court did request the Co-Executors and the Attorney General to resolve their differences concerning the proposed compensation program, which has garnered the support of all interested parties, including claimants’ counsel. The Co-Executors now inform that “[b]ecause the need for the Program has grown increasingly urgent, and with the support of claimants’ counsel and the USVI Attorney General – and because the remaining impediments have been resolved and the interested parties have consented to the Protocol,” they and the Attorney General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program’s active operations, including payment of compensation determinations to eligible claimants.
