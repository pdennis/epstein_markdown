Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM Document 52-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/29/2009 Page 1 of 1

# DECLARATION OF JANE DOE NO. 6

I, [redacted], state as follows:

1. I am the Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe No. 6 in this lawsuit.
2. On July 9, 2009, an investigator came to the office of my former employer, A Affordable Auto Insurance, in Lake Worth, Florida.
3. After the investigator left, I was contacted by my former employer and told that the investigator was asking personal questions about me.
4. I am worried that Jeffrey Epstein will continue to send investigators to speak with other people I know who do not know that I am a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am concerned that the investigators will ask these people very personal questions about my life and disclose that I am a Plaintiff in a sexual abuse lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein.

I declare under penalty of perjury the foregoing to be true and correct.

Dated this 22 day of July, 2009
