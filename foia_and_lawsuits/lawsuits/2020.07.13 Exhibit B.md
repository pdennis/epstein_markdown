GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
Defendant.

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts)

The Grand Jury charges:

OVERVIEW

1. The charges set forth herein stem from the role of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18.

2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to

Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016.

## FACTUAL BACKGROUND

3. During the time periods charged in this Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, including in the below image:

2

4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of means and methods, including but not limited to the following:

a. MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of Epstein’s minor victims prior to their abuse, including by asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending time alone with a minor victim.

b. Having developed a rapport with a victim, MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein.

c. MAXWELL’S presence during minor victims’ interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would

4

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims.

d. In addition, Epstein offered to help some minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept Epstein’s assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to help them.

e. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters.

5. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s access to minor victims knowing that he had a sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein’s resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, touching a victim’s breast, touching a victim’s genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim’s genitals,

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals.

## MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS

6. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the following:

a. A multi-story private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the "New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following photograph:

5

b. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the following photograph:

c. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the following photograph:

![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)

6

d. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, England.

7. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with respect to minor victims:

a. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for

7

and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage.

b. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing

8

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to massage Epstein.

c. MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context of a sexualized massage.

## MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT

8. In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

9

abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the specific events and acts of abuse detailed above.

## STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS

9. From at least in or about 1994, up to and including in or about 1997, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and others known and unknown, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, enticement, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422.

10. It was a part and object of the conspiracy that GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and others known and unknown, would and did knowingly persuade, induce, entice, and coerce one and more individuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce, to engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422.

## Overt Acts

11. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect the illegal object thereof, the following overt acts, among others, were committed in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere:

Good day Attorney Smith:

Please note that I have been retained by Ghislaine Maxwell in regard to two subpoenas from your office which were delivered to Quintairos, Prieto, Wood &amp; Boyer in Miami Florida. I am not sure about your work schedule in light of the COVID-19 issues, but I would like to meet or set up a conference call with you to discuss these matters.

Good day counsels:

I thank you for your consideration in this matter. I cannot waive the issue of service of the subpoenas, nor can I disclose my client's location to anyone at this time. In the interest of resolving this issue, however, I am willing to collect and provide the documents/items on the attached list. As you know, there are rather broad protective orders in the non-VI litigation which preclude even me from accessing most of the information in those cases. I have determined that I can provide the items on the attached list without running afoul of those protective orders. If you are amenable to resolving the subpoenas in this manner please confirm that in writing (perhaps we should draft a short agreement to that effect) and I will collect and produce this information to you in short order.

If you would like to discuss this matter further, please let me know.

David:

Apologies for the slow response, and thank you for reaching out.

First, my reading of the protective order, as with most protective orders, is that Ms. Maxwell can share any document that she produced or other discovery material that she designated confidential.

Second, also per the protective order, Ms. Maxwell could seek the consent of opposing counsel to produce the materials produced by the opposing party.

I suspect that would cover at least substantially all of the documents in that litigation. Please let me know if you disagree with my interpretation.

In part, we focused on these litigation materials because we believe that they would not be burdensome to collect and produce. However, we also would be happy to discuss emails or other records that are relevant to the Government's investigation in Ms. Maxwell's custody and control that could be produced outside of the protective order.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Best,
Linda

Plaintiff,

v.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, SARAH KELLEN, LESLEY GROFF and NATALYA MALYSHEV

Defendants.

No. 17 Civ. 00616 (JGK)

# PLAINTIFF'S RENEWED MOTION TO APPROVE ALTERNATE SERVICE PURSUANT TO FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 4(e)(1)

Plaintiff, Sarah Ransome¹, by and through her undersigned counsel and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1) and the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 308(5) files this Renewed Motion to Approve Alternative Service and for grounds thereof states:

As this Court is aware, Defendant Maxwell is also a defendant in another action in the Southern District of New York, Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-07433 RWS. In that action, Maxwell is represented by counsel who appeared before that Court on her behalf as recently as November 8, 2017. Despite that fact, Maxwell will apparently not authorize her counsel to accept service of the complaint in this case. Indeed, Maxwell’s counsel has gone so far as to hire their own separate legal counsel to argue to this Court that they should not have to accept service in this case. Yet in this very case, Maxwell has already actively participated, including having counsel make a request for additional time to serve her answer and attempting to impose

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 2 of 8

restrictions on the case of discovery materials. See DE 69 and November 23, 2017 Letter to Judge Koeltl, Exhibit D.

While this Court originally granted Plaintiff Ms. Ransome’s Motion for Alternate Service (DE 57), Maxwell’s counsel sought reconsideration of that Order on October 30, 2017. This Court held a hearing on November 28, 2017 and issued an Order on November 30, 2017 instructing Ms. Ransome to again attempt service on Defendant Maxwell on or before January 5, 2018: “By that date, the plaintiff will file either proof of service or a renewed application to the alternate service.” DE 90. As directed, Ms. Ransome has made the following attempts to effectuate service on Maxwell:

- Ms. Ransome provided Maxwell’s counsel of record in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case a copy of the summons and complaint;
- Ms. Ransome emailed a copy of the summons and complaint to the following email address which is publicly associated with Maxwell, gmax@ellmax.com. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, December 4, 2017 E-mail;
- Ms. Ransome retained, at significant expense, a private investigation firm to attempt to effectuate service at locations associated with Maxwell in New York and New Jersey, including the following addresses:

1. 116 E. 65th Street, New York, NY 10065;
2. 457 Madison Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10022; and
3. 55 Monterey Avenue, Teaneck, NJ 07666.

As detailed in the affidavit of Investigator Douglas Mercer (See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2), at one location, it was clear that individuals were present in the home but were refusing to answer the door and accept service;

- Ms. Ransome conducted a public record search of the London Townhome that was identified in Epstein’s Phone Directory as being associated with Defendant Maxwell: 44 Kinnerton Street, London. The UK government record request demonstrates that title to the property was changed on March 17, 2016 to Eaton Square Properties Limited and is no longer owned by Defendant Maxwell rendering attempts at service in London futile. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Summary of Title NGL948023; and

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 3 of 8

- Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is also identified as the founder of the TerraMar Project on its website. The organization has a New York address for its headquarters at 326 E. 65th Street #326, New York, New York 10065. The email address identified with the organization is hello@theterramarproject.org. On January 4, 2018, we served a copy of the summons and complaint to the following potential email addresses:

1. gmaxwell@theterramarproject.org;
2. maxwellg@theterramarproject.org;
3. ghislaine@theterramarproject.org;
4. gmax@theterramarproject.org;
5. maxwell@theterramarproject.org; and
6. ghislaine.maxwell@theterramarproject.org.

See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4. The only email address which received a delivery failure message was maxwell@theterramarproject.org.

Accordingly, having made renewed – and unsuccessful efforts – to serve Maxwell through conventional means, Ms. Ransome now renews her request for alternative service as such means as the Court may find appropriate. Ms. Ransome respectfully suggests that, as the Court allowed in its previous order, that service of the complaints on current legal counsel representing her in a related matter before this Court and other publicly identified email accounts be permitted as a means of alternative service.

## MEMORANDUM OF LAW

Service of a Complaint should not be a game of cat and mouse particularly where the defendant is represented by counsel in a matter pending in the same district. See Carillo v. Hagerty, No. 3:05CV1417 (MRK), 2006 WL 2165679, at *1 (D. Conn. July 31, 2006) (court

Case 1:17-cv-00616-JGK-SN Document 97 Filed 01/05/18 Page 4 of 8

finding defendant should not benefit from service gamesmanship reasoning that: "service of process is not intended to be a game of hide and seek or cat and mouse.").

Based on the exhaustion of the other methods of service delineated above, Ms. Ransome moves, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1), for an order permitting service by an alternative method. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1) provides that service upon a party may be effected by “following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made.” Accordingly, Defendant Maxwell may be served pursuant to CPLR § 308, which provides several methods by which service upon a natural person may be effectuated, including personal service; service by “delivering the summons ... to a person of suitable age and discretion at the actual place of business, dwelling place or usual place of abode of the person to be served” and then mailing the summons to the individual's “last know residence;” or service by “affixing the summons to the door of either the actual place of business, dwelling place or usual place of abode within the state of the person to be served” and then “mailing the summons to such person at his or her last known residence” or to his or her place of business - so called “nail and mail” service. CPLR §§ 308(1), (2) &amp; (4).

If service under CPLR §§ 308(1), (2) &amp; (4) is impracticable, CPLR § 308(5) permits service “in such manner as the court, upon motion without notice, directs.” The determination of whether service is impracticable “depends upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case.” Securities &amp; Exch. Comm'n v. HGI, Inc., No. 99 Civ. 3866 (DLC), 1999 WL 1021087, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 1999). Although the plaintiff must show impracticability of service, there is no requirement of “proof of due diligence or of actual prior attempts to serve a party under the other provisions of the statute.” Id. “When usual methods of service prove impracticable, service

that is reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise the interested party of the pendency of the action will suffice.” D.R.I., Inc. v. Dennis, No. 03 Civ. 10026 (PKL), 2004 WL 1237511, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2004).

New York Courts consistently affirm their right to direct or approve alternative methods of service where regular service has been deemed “impracticable.” For example, in Dobkin v. Chapman, 21 N.Y.2d 490, 498, 289 N.Y.S.2d 161, 168 (1968), the New York Court of Appeals held that where a plaintiff could not follow the prescribed methods of service as set forth in § 308, Courts are “given the discretion to fashion other means adapted to the particular facts of the case before it” pursuant to § 308(5) (referred to in Dobkin as § 308(4), the predecessor to § 308(5)). Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that a Court's discretion to fashion such methods of service “must be broad” if the statute is to be “meaningful.” Id. at 499, 289 N.Y.S.2d at 168.

There is no doubt that Defendant Maxwell has had actual notice and knowledge of the claims asserted in this Complaint. Ms. Ransome has tried multiple alternative avenues to serve Maxwell, including (1) sending the documents to her current counsel in another matter, (2) investigating and attempting service at multiple locations known to be associated with Defendant Maxwell, and (3) emailing the documents to Defendant Maxwell’s publicly available email address. As a result, this Court should deem the service methods attempted to be sufficient and grant the Motion for Alternate Service. See Rampersad v. Deutsche Bank Secs., Inc., No. 02 Civ. 7311 (LTS), 2003 WL21073951, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2003) (authorizing alternative service under § 308(5) when Plaintiff was unable to determine Defendant's residence or place of business after “extensive Internet searches” and inquires with Defendant's former clients); Javier H. v. Garcia-Botello, 217 F.R.D. 308, 309 (W.D.N.Y. 2003) (service by publication authorized when individual Defendant was a fugitive from the criminal justice system; was likely aware of

the pending civil action through his relatives, who were co-Defendants; and when the Court determined that Defendant would likely read a newspaper that was circulated in the region of his last known residence); see also HGI, Inc., 1999 WL 1021087, at *1 (service by publication in USA Today authorized when Defendant's whereabouts were unknown, efforts to locate his home or business address by searching computer databases failed, and there existed no record that he designated an agent for service); D.R.I., Inc., 2004 WL 1237511, at *2 (after Plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to serve Defendant through a process server and searched databases for his address, Court authorized service by sending process by certified mail to Defendant's last known address; by publishing the action in a local newspaper; and by emailing it to Plaintiff's last known email address).

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for this Court to enter an Order granting Plaintiff's Motion to Approve Alternative Service Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1) and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 308(5) upon Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell and finding that the service efforts made by Plaintiff's counsel herein are sufficient.

## MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

John G. Koeltl, United States District Judge

*1 The plaintiff, Sarah Ransome¹, has moved the Court to approve alternative service on the defendant Ghislaine Maxwell and to find that service has been effected. The plaintiff asserts that, despite diligent measures, she has been unable to serve Maxwell personally. The plaintiff argues, however, that she has taken reasonable measures to provide Maxwell with notice of the pending lawsuit and requests that this service should be deemed sufficient. Non-party Haddon Morgan &amp; Foreman, P.C. (“Haddon Morgan”), Maxwell’s counsel in another litigation pending in this Court, has refused to accept service on behalf of Maxwell and has objected to becoming a general agent of process for Maxwell, but has taken no position on the plaintiff’s application to deem service effected through the email efforts that the plaintiff has already made. Neither Maxwell nor any representative of Maxwell has otherwise opposed the current motion.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1) permits a plaintiff to serve a defendant by following the procedures set forth by state law in the state where the district court is located. New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 308 sets forth available methods of service. Where service under §§ 308(1), (2), or (4)—which generally provide variants of personal service—is impracticable, § 308(5) provides that the Court may approve alternative service methods. See, e.g., Rampersad v. Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc., No. 02-cv-7311(LTS)(AJP), 2003 WL 21073951, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 9, 2003). Service under § 308(5) requires a showing of impracticability of the other methods of service, but does not require a showing of due diligence. Id.

The plaintiff has taken various steps in an effort to serve Maxwell personally—all to no avail. The plaintiff retained a private investigation firm to attempt to determine where Maxwell resides, and that firm attempted service at three physical addresses potentially associated with Maxwell. The plaintiff also emailed the summons and complaint to several email addresses that are publicly associated with Maxwell, only one of which has been returned as undelivered. The plaintiff has also provided a copy of the summons and complaint to Haddon Morgan who currently represents Maxwell in another litigation pending in this district.

Under these circumstances, the plaintiff has demonstrated impracticability, because she has made numerous efforts to obtain information about the defendant’s current residence and general contact information to effectuate personal service but has been unable to locate Maxwell. See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Nnebe, No. 01-cv-5247 (KMW), 2003 WL 402377, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2003) (collecting cases). Accordingly, the Court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated that service on Maxwell is impracticable and thus grants the motion for alternative service.

*2 Further, the steps already taken by the plaintiff to serve Maxwell are “reasonably calculated, under the circumstances, to apprise [her] of the pendency of the action and afford [her] an opportunity to present [he]r objections,” and the Court therefore deems service of the summons and complaint to be complete as to defendant Maxwell. See, e.g., Bozza v. Love, No. 15-CV-3271 (LGS), 2015 WL 4039849, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2015) (holding that service upon the defendant’s counsel in an unrelated matter was sufficient); Rampersad, 2003 WL 21073951, at *1.

Finally, Haddon Morgan’s objection to becoming a general agent of process for Maxwell is unfounded. The Court’s ruling that service by email and personal delivery to Haddon Morgan has been reasonably calculated to provide Maxwell with notice of this lawsuit and an opportunity to respond does not turn Haddon Morgan into a general agent for Maxwell. Indeed, this order does not even require Haddon Morgan to

accept service on behalf of Maxwell, but rather finds that service on Haddon Morgan is likely to provide notice of the lawsuit to Maxwell, given that Haddon Morgan is presumably in contact with Maxwell with regards to their representation of her in the other pending matter. See Bozza, 2015 WL 4039849, at *2.

Accordingly, the motion for alternative service is granted. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motion pending at Docket Number 97. Defendant Maxwell’s time to move or answer is twenty-one days from the date of this order. If Maxwell chooses not to appear, the plaintiff may pursue whatever remedies are available, including the entry of a default judgment.
