F. To the extent the Court does not include in the approved Case Management Plan item D above (which provides for limited discovery of agreed upon categories of documents pending a ruling on Defendants’ motion to dismiss), discovery shall proceed as follows (in addition to the disclosures required by Fed.

1. Documents. First request for production of documents, if any, must be served by July 21, 2023. Further document requests may be served as required, but no document request may be served later than 30 days prior to the date of the close of discovery as set forth in item 6 below.

R. Civ. P. 26(a).

3. Experts. Every party-proponent of a claim (including any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim) that intends to offer expert testimony in respect of such claim must make the disclosures required by Fed.
