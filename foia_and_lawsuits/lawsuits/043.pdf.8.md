**Re:** *VE v. Nine East 71st Street, et al.*, 1:19-cv-07625 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

We represent Plaintiff VE in the above-captioned action. Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint in this matter on August 20, 2019. [DE 03]. On November 29, 2019, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint [DE 36], Declaration in Support [DE 37], and Memorandum of Law [DE 38].

On December 9, 2019, Plaintiff notified the Court and Defendants in writing that Plaintiff did not intend to file an amended pleading and would rely on her current First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is due December 13, 2019.

Plaintiff is requesting an extension to file her Opposition to Defendants’ Motion from December 13, 2019 to December 18, 2019. The requested extension would not affect any other scheduled dates in this action.

Plaintiff has conferred with Defendants and they have no objection to the requested extension.

Respectfully Submitted,

EDWARDS POTTINGER LLC
