Re: Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Jack:

On December 3, 2009, Jeffrey Epstein and I met with opposing counsel in New York City, New York on a matter to review certain confidential documents, which counsel only would provide for our review in his offices. The meeting was very helpful, but necessary time with Mr. Epstein was cut short due to his obvious time constraints.

It is clear that the case requires considerable time, and is at the stage that we must review considerable additional documents and attempt to interview potential witnesses. It is impractical to bring the lawyers for the other side with their documents to Florida and Mr. Epstein’s presence is required to prepare for and interview potential witnesses, who live in the New York area. We will need three more days of meetings with Mr. Epstein to determine our next course of action.

Jack Goldberger, Esq.

As a result, I would request that you provide me with a period of three days when Mr. Epstein can be available in New York to continue to work with us on this matter.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
