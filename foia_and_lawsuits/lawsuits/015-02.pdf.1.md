IN RE PLAINTIFF MJ

# AFFIDAVIT OF THOMAS MARSIGLIANO

1. Your Affiant is a former New York City Police Detective and a current private investigator licensed by the State of New York to conduct investigations and serve process, I have been retained by the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos and Lehrman to serve a summons, complaint, subpoena for deposition, interrogatories, request for production on Jeffrey Epstein. The case is MJ v. Jeffrey Epstein, No. 10-81111, and is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

2. On September 20, 2010 I received a package from the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos and Lehrman which contained the summons, complaint, subpoena for deposition, interrogatories, request for production on MJ v. Jeffrey Epstein. I was advised by Michael Fisten, a Florida Licensed Private Investigator who is working for the law firm of Farmer Jaffe Weissing Edwards Fistos and Lehrman that the summons should be served at Epstein’s New York residence located at 9 East 71 Street, New York City, New York.

3. I had learned from Investigator Fisten that Epstein’s New York residence has been featured in Magazines and News Papers as a residence that once belonged to Epstein’s long time associate Leslie Wexner and now belongs to Jeffrey Epstein. Investigator Fisten also related to me that while Epstein was on probation in 2010, Epstein listed his residence in New York as 9 East 71 Street on official probation travel documents and that an asset investigation revealed that Epstein was the owner of the residence.

4. On Tuesday the 21st Day of September 2010 your Affiant conducted surveillance at the Epstein residence. Activity was observed in and out of the residence which would indicate that persons(s) were residing within. At one point Federal Agents from the Department of State secured the Epstein residence and closed the street where the residence was located. The State Department Agents were providing security for a foreign dignitary that was visiting the Epstein residence.

5. On Friday the 8th day of October 2010, your Affiant knocked on the residential front door of the Epstein residence located at 9 East 71 Street, New York, New York. A white male who identified himself as “Mark” answered the front door. Your Affiant advised “Mark” that I was a New York Private Investigator and that I had court papers to serve on Jeffrey Epstein for a lawsuit in Florida. Mark advised that Mr. Epstein was not at home at the time. Mark agreed to accept service for Mr. Epstein. I left the summons, complaint, subpoena for deposition, interrogatories, request for production with “Mark” who reentered the residence carrying the package in his hands.

6. Based on my interaction with “Mark” and my observations, it was obvious that “Mark” was familiar with Jeffrey Epstein, had authority to answer the door of Mr. Epstein’s home and accept service for Mr. Epstein.

7. Mark agreed to give the papers to Mr. Epstein or Epstein’s lawyers before accepting the documents and returning back inside the home.

8. Your affiant prepared the proper return of service documents and forwarded them to Attorney Bradley Edwards to file in Florida.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NAUGHT.

Dated this 05 day of November, 2010.
