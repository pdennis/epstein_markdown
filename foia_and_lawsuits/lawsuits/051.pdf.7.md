ORDER

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

The Court has reviewed the parties’ letter dated April 15, 2021, setting forth their available dates for trial, ECF No. 50. Due to conflicts in the Court’s and the parties’ availability in the third quarter of 2021, the Court, utilizing the procedures within this District governing the scheduling of jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, will instead seek to schedule a jury trial for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021. By July 16, 2021, the parties shall submit blackout dates for trial.

The time between June 14, 2021 and October 1, 2021 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the public and Defendants in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently administer the Court's docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties to prepare for trial and to discuss potential pretrial disposition.

SO ORDERED.

Dated: April 19, 2021
New York, New York
