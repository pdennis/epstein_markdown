8. This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District.

## Factual Allegations

9. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) was an adult male, 52 years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach.
10. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein’s trap and became one of his victims.
11. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas.
12. An integral player in Epstein’s Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach

Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein’s plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per “massage” session - and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.

13. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina with a vibrator.

14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein’s mansion in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He demanded that Jane remove her clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane.

15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane to him.

16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.
