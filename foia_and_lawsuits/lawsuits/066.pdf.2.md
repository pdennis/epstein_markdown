Proposed

# AGREED ORDER

This cause came on to be heard upon the agreement of the parties, Jack Goldberger representing Jeffrey Epstein and Barbara Burns representing the State of Florida, and the Court being fully advised that the parties have reviewed both the plea agreement and the transcript of the plea conference in the Defendants case and have confirmed that the requirement of "mandatory public service" as a special condition of community control checked off on the Order Placing the Defendant on Community Control was due to a clerical error. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the special condition of "mandatory public service" is deleted.

The Court being further advised that the Order Placing the Defendant on Community Control did not address the Defendant's travel outside the State of Florida for work or business purposes and the parties desire to clarify that omission, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that the Defendant is authorized to travel outside the State of Florida for business and work purposes if allowed by his community control officer. At least 48 hours before the need to travel outside the State of Florida for work purposes the Defendant shall first obtain the permission of his community control officer and then follow any instructions or

requirements imposed on him by his community control officer.

DONE AND ORDERED in West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida on this ______ day of September, 2009.
