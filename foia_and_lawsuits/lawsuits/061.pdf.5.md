# PROCEEDINGS

BE IT REMEMBERED that the following proceedings were had and testimony adduced before the Honorable Jeffrey Colbath, at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, West Palm Beach, Florida beginning at the hour of 11:08 a.m. on June 10, 2009, with appearances as herein noted to-wit:

THE COURT: State vs. Epstein. Let me have for the record, announce everybody's appearance.

MR. BERGER: Your Honor, William J. Berger and Bradley Edwards for non-party .

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor, Deanna Shullman of Thomas, LoCiero &amp; Bralow for non-party The Palm Beach Post.

THE COURT: Let me slow down a little bit. On behalf of The Post is?

MS. SHULLMAN: Deanna Shullman.

THE COURT: S-H-U-L --

MS. SHULLMAN: S-H-U-L-L-M-A-N.

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman, good morning. Mr. Berger, good morning. And Mr. Berger, your client is .

MR. BERGER: yes.

THE COURT: Anybody else here?

MR. EDWARDS: Brad Edwards on behalf of as well, Judge. Thanks.

THE COURT: Last name is spelled?
MR. EDWARDS: Edwards. E-D-W-A-R-D-S.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. GOLDBERGER: For the other side, Your Honor, Jack Goldberger along with Robert Critton on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein.
THE COURT: It is the Post's and [redacted] Motion to Intervene for the purpose of unsealing records?
MR. BERGER: Yes, sir.
THE COURT: Here's what I think I know, and I tell you this so that you can fill in the gaps of what you know that I don't know and suggest what you think I ought to do. It appears to me that there was some agreement -- an agreement that was sealed and then an addendum or amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents in the Court's files under seal and it appears as though the punitive interveners want to unseal those and take a peak at them. I don't see where any of the proper procedures to seal the documents was ever followed to begin with. I don't know but it's not jumping out at me when I reviewed the file. So, I'm thinking that it might be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the opportunity to jump through the hur -- hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

I'll grant that request. If they're not entitled to seal then I'll order it as documents unsealed. But that's kind of procedurally where I think the case is. I will allow Mr. Berger and Ms. Shullman to argue if they wish to, otherwise I will go over to Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton to perhaps talk about what they think about my suggestion. Mr. Berger?

MR. BERGER: I -- I'd like to hear what they say.

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MS. SHULLMAN: Agreed.

THE COURT: Mr. Goldberger?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor --

THE COURT: I mean, it looks like they just handed up an Agreed Order to sign.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, if the Court -- I know the Court is trying to short circuit here and the idea in theory is not horrible, it's not terrible, it's actually not so bad. But let me alert the Court to a couple of issues. First of all, this is not something that came up ahead of time where we were moving to close a hearing or file documents under seal and the Rules of Judicial Administration makes an important distinction between things that are done in advance and things that come up during a hearing and the fact that maybe it goes to the Rule -- talk about situations that arise during the course

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. Secondly, Motion to Intervene is brought under a Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a Rule that applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that I know the Court's desire to get to the issues here and I just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I think it's really important. The Plaintiff's, has this agreement already. They have this agreement. Counsel will tell you they have this agreement. There have been two hearings in front of Judge Marra who has the Federal cases here. They moved to unseal the non-prosecution agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial Order, a very, very well reasoned Order which I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Oh, thanks.

MR. GOLDBERGER: He entered a very, very well reasoned Order weighing the interest of the Plaintiffs to have access to the non-prosecution agreement with the confidentiality that the parties intended to be part of this agreement. And what he did, he said they can have this agreement. They can review it all they want. If they want to review it with somebody else, they need to give them a copy of this Order that it is not to be disclosed to anyone else. Subsequent to that -- so that's the Rule that's in place right now. Subsequent to that the

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this Order. We want to disseminate this agreement to other parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying that request and said, no. My Order is in place but if you have some compelling reason why you want this agreement to be disseminated to others, file a motion and come back to me.

THE COURT: This is as a result of some civil litigation pending in the Federal Courthouse?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes.

THE COURT: As opposed to any criminal prosecution going on?

MR. GOLDBERGER: It is civil proceedings that are going on in Federal Court. But in the interest of comedy, Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality agreement and has put a well reasoned procedure into place. If the parties want that agreement unsealed where they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge Marra invited them to do so.

THE COURT: That may be as it pertains to , but what about The Post?

MR. GOLDBERGER: I think -- and I think I know where the Court is going on this. If The Post's position is the public has right to acc -- access to this then there is a procedure in place and ultimately the Court has to conduct

Proceedings

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at whether there is some compelling government interest and that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. So I have no great objection to filing the Request for Closure and then have a hearing in front of the Court.

THE COURT: Well, let's do -- I'm thinking out loud. I'm not ruling. I will give you all a chance to argue further, but this is what I'm thinking I will do, grant the Motion to Intervene. It gives standing to It gives standing to The Post to contest the fact that these were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the State and Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to seal these documents. Until such time that I rule on that I will leave them under seal because they might have been correctly sealed but the procedure wasn't followed. There's got to be notice. You've got to comply with the Administrative Order 2.303. You've got to comply with the Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(d). I think even though that's a civil -- it addresses a civil matter this is, you know, in the nature of a civil procedure. So, I'll do that. And thank you for these Orders. So, where do we go from here? I'm thinking out loud, not ruling. Mr. Berger?

MR. BERGER: Judge, with all due respect I completely disagree with counsel's characterization of

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

those two Orders. I don't know if he handed up both to you?

THE COURT: I do.

MR. BERGER: They simply do not say what he tells you they say.

THE COURT: I'll read them --

MR. BERGER: All right.

THE COURT: -- and I'll allow you to make that argument --

MR. BERGER: And -- and --

THE COURT: -- at the time of the Renewed Motion to Seal.

MR. BERGER: All right. And, also, I don't think the Court -- I think the Court needs to deal with this immediately, expeditiously. This is a matter that the Supreme Court has placed incredible scrutiny over. And the Rule that we are traveling under -- we're not only traveling under a Rule of Judicial Administration that applies to criminal and civil cases, we're applying to an Administrative Order of this Court that was in place when the sealing was done and that superseded the sealing.

THE COURT: I --

MR. BERGER: I'm just saying, I respectfully request that the Court not delay this one minute.

THE COURT: You've got the agreements.

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

MR. BERGER: Pardon me?

THE COURT: You've got the agreements anyway. You've got what's under seal.

MR. BERGER: Judge, we cannot do anything with them.

THE COURT: Take that up with Judge Marra.

MR. BERGER: No, sir. That is not what the Order says. May I quote Judge Marra. "If a specific tangible need arises in a civil case the relief should be sought in that case." In other words, the civil cases which are in front of Judge Hafele is one forum that Judge Marra said go to it. Judge Marra did not say that this Court does not have jurisdiction to unseal its own sealed records or to vacate its own Order sealing. And any characterization is -- is false.

THE COURT: I'll take a look at it and I'll draw from it what it says -- what I think it says. I appreciate your zealous representation of your client. Please, it appears as though you're yelling at me.

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor?

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MR. BERGER: Judge, this happens to be a very serious matter and every day of delay delays our discovery.

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor, if I may be heard on the

Proceedings
June 10, 2009
11

issue as well. As a representative of the public's right of access --

THE COURT: Right.

MS. SHULLMAN: -- here essentially, I would agree with Mr. Berger that we need an immediate hearing on this issue. That's what we're here to do today. I think I heard Your Honor say that he's not clear that the procedures were applied. My review of the record does not reveal that the procedures were complied with. My review is similar to Your Honor's. It looks like sort of everybody approached the bench and Judge Pucillo said let's take it under seal. If Mr. Epstein's counsel is not prepared to go forward today and meet his burden, then I would ask that this Court set a hearing as soon as practical because the right solution here should be to unseal the records and then, you know --

THE COURT: I've gotcha.

MS. SHULLMAN: -- and they have to make a motion.

THE COURT: Well, what house is on fire? I mean, what is the -- I think what they have to do is they've got to give ten days notice pursuant to the Rule -- the Administrative Order, Rules of Judicial Administration, to go through that process. What -- what prejudice is there? What house is burning down if I say okay. State and defense, go ahead and expeditiously move through the

12
Proceedings
June 10, 2009

process and let's get this back on my docket as quickly as possible and give them until Friday to file their notice and ten days after that we have an evidentiary hearing. I go through the process then. What bad thing is going to happen by waiting these extra twelve to fifteen days?

MS. SHULLMAN: The bad thing that's going to happen, Your Honor, is that the status quo in Florida is that the constitutional right of access is openness.

THE COURT: Right.

MS. SHULLMAN: You know, certainly if Your Honor is inclined to postpone this hearing I would ask that it be done expeditiously as you suggest.

THE COURT: Yeah.

MS. SHULLMAN: You know, Friday and then ten days thereafter, it just delays access for another two weeks and it infringes on our rights.

THE COURT: I agree, Mr. Berger, I will let you answer that same question.

MR. BERGER: I don't think --

THE COURT: Anything specific rather than --

MR. BERGER: Yes.

THE COURT: You know, anything closed that the people are allowed to look at is a transgression and any transgression is bad, but anything unique beyond that?

MR. BERGER: Your Honor -- Your Honor, I do not

Proceedings

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit the propriety of the sealing of these records and give the Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at the apple. If the records are sealed improperly, which the Court has said on its face that appears to have occurred, I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow them a second bite at the apple to go through with the notice requirements. They should have done that in front of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 simply does not give this Court the right to reactivate the procedure that you outlined.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Goldberger or Mr. Critton?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Just note. Your Honor, as far as the timing of this and we want to do this expeditiously, of course, this sealing occurred not last week, not two weeks ago, not four months ago but eleven and one half months ago. The Post reported this last July. So, I understand the right for the public to have access and we want to do this as quickly as possible but there is no fire here. There is no house burning.

THE COURT: Then I'll go ahead and enter an Order as

Proceedings
June 10, 2009
14

I've indicated, that is that I'll grant the Intervener's Motion to Intervene. You have standing. I will order that the State and/or the defense by noon Friday file a Notice of -- comply with the Administrative Order 2.303 and the Judicial Rule -- the Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420, paragraph d, that outlines the procedures to seal files in these types of cases and then we'll get a hearing scheduled for argument on whether or not they will be sealed. Until that time they will remain sealed because Judge Pucillo signed off on the Order and I'm not inclined to disturb that until I find more about the merits of the movant's position.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anybody want to reduce any of that mess to a written Order?

MR. EDWARDS: I'd like to Your Honor. I'd like to know if you're going to give us a hearing date today.

THE COURT: I'll deal with that. Yeah. Let me give you some time. How much time do you think it's going to take? I don't think I'm going to have any surprises. How much time do you think we need? A half hour?

MR. EDWARDS: Not more. I'd say an hour at the longest.

THE COURT: I'm not taking evidence or anything like that. In the meantime, do you agree it would be prudent

June 10, 2009
15
Proceedings

for me to take a look and see what the content of these things are so I can be articulate on what -- their know about? I didn't do that for today's hearing?

MR. GOLDBERGER: The defense --

MR. EDWARDS: The non-prosecution agreement?

THE COURT: Right. Whatever is under seal. Whatever it is that's under seal I'll take a look at it so that I can at least have a feel for apparently what you all know and I don't.

MR. GOLDBERGER: The defense has no objection.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll go ahead and read those two sealed documents and I'll see you back here, assuming that Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton get that done between now and Friday. Ten days from this Friday is the 22nd. How about we do this on the 25th at 1:30?

MR. GOLDBERGER: One moment, Your Honor. That's fine with me.

MR. BERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: All right. Great. Thank you so much.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you, Judge.

# PROCEEDINGS

BE IT REMEMBERED that the following proceedings were had and testimony adduced before the Honorable Jeffrey Colbath, at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, West Palm Beach, Florida beginning at the hour of 11:08 a.m. on June 10, 2009, with appearances as herein noted to-wit:

THE COURT: State vs. Epstein. Let me have for the record, announce everybody's appearance.

MR. BERGER: Your Honor, William J. Berger and Bradley Edwards for non-party

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor, Deanna Shullman of Thomas, LoCiero &amp; Kralow for non-party The Palm Beach Post.

THE COURT: Let me slow down a little bit. On behalf of The Post is?

MR. SHULLMAN: Deanna Shullman. THE COURT: S-H-U-L

MS. SHULLMAN: S-H-U-L-L-M-A-N.

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman, good morning. Mr. Berger, good morning. And Mr. Berger, your client is

MR. BERGER: , yes.

THE COURT: Anybody else here?

MR. EDWARDS: Brad Edwards on behalf of as well, Judge. Thanks.

Proceedings

June 10, 2009

THE COURT: Last name is spelled? MR. EDWARDS: Edwards. E-D-W-A-R-D-S. THE COURT: Okay.

MR. GOLDBERGER: For the other side, Your Honor, Jack Goldberger along with Robert Critton on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein.

THE COURT: It is the Post's and [redacted] Motion to Intervene for the purpose of unsealing records?

MR. BERGER: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: Here's what I think I know, and I tell you this so that you can fill in the gaps of what you know that I don't know and suggest what you think I ought to do. It appears to me that there was some agreement -- an agreement that was sealed and then an addendum or amendment to the agreement that was sealed as to documents in the Court's files under seal and it appears as though the punitive interveners want to unseal those and take a peak at them. I don't see where any of the proper procedures to seal the documents was ever followed to begin with. I don't know but it's not jumping out at me when I reviewed the file. So, I'm thinking that it might be appropriate and the burden might be on the moving party, being the State and Mr. Epstein, to give them the opportunity to jump through the hur -- hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled to have them sealed, then

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

I'll grant that request. If they're not entitled to seal then I'll order it as documents unsealed. But that's kind of procedurally where I think the case is. I will allow Mr. Berger and Ms. Shullman to argue if they wish to, otherwise I will go over to Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton to perhaps talk about what they think about my suggestion. Mr. Berger?

MR. BERGER: I -- I'd like to hear what they say. THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MS. SHULLMAN: Agreed.

THE COURT: Mr. Goldberger? MR. GOLDBERGER: Your Honor -

THE COURT: I mean, it looks like they just handed up an Agreed Order to sign.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Well, if the Court -- I know the Court is trying to short circuit here and the idea in theory is not horrible, it's not terrible, it's actually not so bad. But let me alert the Court to a couple of issues. First of all, this is not something that came up ahead of time where we were moving to close a hearing or file documents under seal and the Rules of Judicial Administration makes an important distinction between things that are done in advance and things that come up during a hearing and the fact that maybe it goes to the Rule -- talk about situations that arise during the course

Proceedings

of a hearing, that the Rules would not apply to that. Secondly, [REDACTED] Motion to Intervene is brought under a Rule that does not apply because she brought it under a Rule that applies to non-criminal cases. Having said that I know the Court's desire to get to the issues here and I just need to alert the Court to one other matter because I think its really important. The Plaintiff's, [REDACTED], has this agreement already. They have this agreement. Counsel will tell you they have this agreement. There have been two hearings in front of Judge Marra who has the Federal cases here. They moved to unseal the non-prosecution agreement in front of Judge Marra. He entered an initial Order, a very, very well reasoned order which I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Oh, thanks.

MR. GOLDBERGER: He entered a very, very well reasoned order weighing the interest of the Plaintiffs to have access to the non-prosecution agreement with the confidentiality that the parties intended to be part of this agreement. And what he did, he said they can have this agreement. They can review it all they want. If they want to review it with somebody else, they need. to give them a copy of this Order that it is not to be disclosed to anyone else. Subsequent to that -- so that's the Rule that's in place right now. Subsequent to that the

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

Plaintiffs went back and said we want to disseminate this Order. We want to disseminate this agreement to other parties and Judge Marra entered a second Order denying that request and said, no. My Order is in place but if you have some compelling reason why you want this agreement to be disseminated to others, file a motion and come back to me.

THE COURT: This is as a result of some civil litigation pending in the Federal Courthouse?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes.

THE COURT: As opposed to any criminal prosecution going on?

MR. GOLDBERGER: It is civil proceedings that are going on in Federal Court. But in the interest of comedy, Your Honor, the Court has ruled on the confidentiality agreement and has put a well reasoned procedure into place. If the parties want that agreement unsealed where they need to go is go back to Federal Court and Judge Marra invited them to do so.

THE COURT: That may be as it pertains to , but what about The Post?

MR. GOLDBERGER: I think -- and I think I know where the Court is going on this. If The Post's position is the public has right to acc -- access to this then there is a procedure in place and ultimately the Court has to conduct

Proceedings

June 10, 2009

a hearing and do the balancing test where you look at whether there is some compelling government interest and that's going to require an evidentiary hearing. So I have no great objection to filing the Request for Closure and then have a hearing in front of the Court.

THE COURT: Well, let's do -- I'm thinking out loud. I'm not ruling. I will give you all a chance to argue further, but this is what I'm thinking I will do, grant the Motion to Intervene. It gives standing to It gives standing to The Post to contest the fact that these were sealed. And then I will shift the burden back on the State and Defendant, Mr. Epstein, to petition the Court to seal these documents. Until such time that I rule on that I will leave them under seal because they might have been correctly sealed but the procedure wasn't followed. There's got to be notice. You've got to comply with the Administrative order 2.303. You've got to comply with the Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(d). I think even though that's a civil -- it addresses a civil matter this is, you know, in the nature of a civil procedure. So, I'll do that. And thank you for these Orders. So, where do we go from here? I'm thinking out loud, not ruling, Mr. Berger?

MR. BERGER: Judge, with all due respect I completely disagree with counsel's characterization of

Proceedings
June 10, 2009

those two Orders. I don't know if he handed up both to you?

THE COURT: I do.

MR. BERGER: They simply do not say what he tells you they say.

THE COURT: I'll read them -MR. BERGER: All right.

THE COURT: -- and I'll allow you to make that argument -

MR. BERGER: And -- and -

THE COURT: -- at the time of the Renewed Motion to Seal.

MR. BERGER: All right. And, also, I don't think the Court -- I think the Court needs to deal with this immediately, expeditiously. This is a matter that the Supreme Court has placed incredible scrutiny over. And the Rule that we are traveling under -- we're not only traveling under a Rule of Judicial Administration that applies to criminal and civil cases, we're applying to an Administrative Order of this Court that was in place when the sealing was done and that superseded the sealing.

THE COURT: I -

MR. BERGER: I'm just saying, I respectfully request that the Court not delay this one minute.

THE COURT: You've got the agreements.

MR. BERGER: Pardon me?

THE COURT: You've got the agreements anyway. You've got what's under seal.

MR. BERGER: Judge, we cannot do anything with them. THE COURT: Take that up with Judge Marra.

MR. BERGER: No, sir. That is not what the Order says. May I quote Judge Marra. "If a specific tangible need arises in a civil case the relief should be sought in that case." In other words, the civil cases which are in front of Judge Hafele is one forum that Judge Marra said go to it. Judge Marra did not say that this Court does not have jurisdiction to unseal its own sealed records or to vacate its own Order sealing. And any characterization is -- is false.

THE COURT: I'll take a look at it and I'll draw from it what it says -- what I think it says. I appreciate your zealous representation of your client. Please, it appears as though you're yelling at me.

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor? THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MR. BERGER: Judge, this happens to be a very serious matter and every day of delay delays our discovery.

THE COURT: Ms. Shullman?

MS. SHULLMAN: Your Honor, if I may be heard on the

issue as well. As a representative of the public's right of access -

THE COURT: Right.

MS. SHULLMAN: -- here essentially, I would agree with Mr. Berger that we need an immediate hearing on this issue. That's what we're here to do today. I think I heard Your Honor say that he's not clear that the procedures were applied. My review of the record does not reveal that the procedures were complied with. My review is similar to Your Honor's. It looks like sort of everybody approached the bench and Judge Pucillo said let's take it under seal. If Mr. Epstein's counsel is not prepared to go forward today and meet his burden, then I would ask that this Court set a hearing as soon as practical because the right solution here should be to unseal the records and then, you know -

THE COURT: I've gotcha.

MS. SHULLMAN: -- and they have to make a motion. THE COURT: Well, what house is on fire? I mean, what is the -- I think what they have to do is they've got to give ten days notice pursuant to the Rule -- the Administrative Order, Rules of Judicial Administration, to go through that process. What -- what prejudice is there? What house is burning down if I say okay. State and defense, go ahead and expeditiously move through the

2 process and let's get this back on my docket as quickly as possible and give them until Friday to file their notice and ten days after that we have an evidentiary hearing. I go through the process then. What bad thing is going to happen by waiting these extra twelve to fifteen days?

MS. SHULLMAN: The bad thing that's going to happen, Your Honor, is that the status quo in Florida is that the constitutional right of access is openness.

THE COURT: Right.

MS. SHULLMAN: You know, certainly if Your Honor is inclined to postpone this hearing, I would ask that it be done expeditiously as you suggest.

THE COURT: Yeah.

MS. SHULLMAN: You know, Friday and then ten days thereafter, it just delays access for another two weeks and it infringes on our rights.

THE COURT: I agree. Mr. Berger, I will let you answer that same question.

MR. BERGER: I don't think -

THE COURT: Anything specific rather than -MR. BERGER: Yes.

THE COURT: You know, anything closed that the people are allowed to look at is a transgression and any transgression is bad, but anything unique beyond that?

MR. BERGER: Your Honor -- Your Honor, I do not

believe that this Court has the jurisdiction to revisit the propriety of the sealing of these records and give the Defendant or the State, for that matter, a second bite at the apple. If the records are sealed improperly, which the Court has said on its face that appears to have occurred, I do not believe that this Court has jurisdiction to allow them a second bite at the apple to go through with the notice requirements. They should have done that in front of Judge Pucillo a year ago and they did not do it. The Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 simply does not give this Court the right to reactivate the procedure that you outlined.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Goldberger or Mr. Critton?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Just note, Your Honor, as far as the timing of this and we want to do this expeditiously, of course, this sealing occurred not last week, not two weeks ago, not four months ago but eleven and one half months ago. The Post reported this last July. So, I

understand the right for the public to have access and we want to do this as quickly as possible but there is no fire here. There is no house burning.

THE COURT: Then I'll go ahead and enter an Order as

Proceedings

I've indicated, that is that I'll grant the Intervener's Motion to Intervene. You have standing. I will order that the State and/or the defense by noon Friday file a Notice of -- comply with the Administrative Order 2.303 and the Judicial Rule -- the Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420, paragraph d, that outlines the procedures to seal files in these types of cases and then we'll get a hearing scheduled for argument on whether or not they will be sealed. Until that time they will remain sealed because Judge Pucillo signed off on the order and I'm not inclined

to disturb that until I find more about the merits of the movant's position.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anybody want to reduce any of that mass to a written Order?

MR. EDWARDS: I'd like to Your Honor. I'd like to know if you're going to give us a hearing date today. THE COURT: I'll deal with that. Yeah. Let me give you some time. How much time do you think it's going to take? I don't think I'm going to have any surprises. How much time do you think we need? A half hour?

MR. EDWARDS: Not more. I'd say an hour at the longest.

THE COURT: I'm not taking evidence or anything like that. In the meantime, do you agree it would be prudent?

for me to take a look and see what the content of these things are so I can be articulate on what -- their know about? I didn't do that for today's hearing?

MR. GOLDBERGER: The defense -

MR. EDWARDS: The non-prosecution agreement?

THE COURT: Right. Whatever is under seal. Whatever it is that's under seal I'll take a look at it so that I can at least have a feel for apparently what you all know and I don't.

MR. GOLDBERGER: The defense has no objection.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll go ahead and read those two sealed documents and I'll see you back here, assuming that Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Critton get that done between now and Friday. Ten days from this Friday is the 22nd. How about we do this on the 25th at 1:30?

MR. GOLDBERGER: One moment, Your Honor. That's fine with me.

MR. BERGER: Thank you.

THE COURT: All right. Great. Thank you so much. MR. GOLDBERGER: Thank you, Judge.

# IN THE CIRCUIT OCURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
## IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA

ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2.303-9/08

### IN RE: SEALING OF COURT HEARINGS AND RECORDS

The Florida constitution mandates that the public shall have access to court records, subject only to certain enumerated limitations which are restricted by operation of state law, federal law, or court rule. *In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Admin. 2.420 – Sealing of Court Records, 954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007).* The Rules of the Supreme Court strongly disfavor court records that are hidden from public scrutiny. The Florida Supreme Court recently adopted Interim Rule 2.420 of the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration which addresses the procedures for sealing noncriminal court records. In order to ensure that both criminal and noncriminal court records are sealed properly it is.

**NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority conferred by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.215, it is ORDERED as follows:**

1. A request to make court records or a court hearing confidential in any type of case must be made by written motion. Parties cannot submit an agreed-upon order. The Motion must be captioned “Motion to Make Court Records Confidential” or “Motion to Make Court Hearing Confidential”. The Motion must identify with particularity the records or hearing to be made confidential and the grounds upon which it is based. The Motion must include a signed certification by the party making the request that the motion is being made in good faith and is supported by a sound factual and legal basis.

2. The records that are the subject of a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential will be treated as confidential pending resolution of the motion. The case number, docket number, or other identifying number of a case will remain public. Pseudonyms may be used as permitted by the court. Court records made confidential under this rule must be treated as confidential during any appellate proceeding in this Circuit.

3. A public hearing on any motion to seal a court record or court hearing will be held as soon as practicable but no less than ten (10) days prior to the notice being given to the public and the press and no later than 30 days after the filing of the motion. A party may seek to hold all or

a portion of the hearing on a Motion to Make Court Records Confidential in camera if necessary to protect any of the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9)(A). The moving party will be responsible for ensuring that a complete record of any hearing be created either by use of a court reporter or by any recording device that is provided as a matter of right by the court.

4. A sealing order issued by a court must state with specificity the grounds for sealing and the findings of the court that justify sealing. The order granting the sealing request must contain as much detail as possible including the parties’ names or pseudonyms, whether the progress docket is to be confidential, the court records that are to be confidential and the names of persons who are permitted access. The order must contain specific findings that the degree, duration, and manner of confidentiality are no broader than necessary to protect the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9)(A). The order will not reveal the information that is to be made confidential. The order will direct whether the progress docket is to be sealed.

5. If an order sealing a court file is silent as to whether the progress docket is to be sealed, the clerk shall seal the court file but maintain a public docket with no alternation of the parties’ names. In accordance with Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9) the Clerk shall NOT seal the case number, docket number, or any other identifying number of a case that is sealed by court order.

6. The Court will direct the Clerk to post the order sealing the court file on the Clerk’s website as well as on the bulletin board located at the Main Courthouse within ten (10) days following the entry of the order and must remain posted in both locations for at least 30 days.

7. A nonparty may file a written motion to vacate a sealing order in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 (2007); In re Amendments to Florida Rule of Judicial Admin. 2.420 – Sealing of Court Records, 954 So.2d 16 (Fla. 2007).

8. A public hearing must be held on any contested motion to vacate a sealing order. The court, in its discretion, may hold a hearing on an uncontested motion. While challenge hearings must be open to the public, a party may seek to hold a portion or all of the hearing in camera if necessary to protect the interests listed in Interim Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(c)(9)(A). The movant must ensure that a record of the hearing is made. The movant seeking to vacate an order bears the burden of showing that the order is unsound.

9. If the identity of a party is to remain confidential, all applicable pleadings will be filed with the following designation on the front of the pleading: “Confidential Party – Court Service Requested”. The judicial assistant for the division in which the pleading is filed is responsible for providing such notice to the applicable parties. The judicial assistant is to provide such notice so as not to inadvertently reveal the identity of the confidential party.

10. This administrative rule does NOT address the confidentiality of records admitted into evidence and it does NOT pertain to the statutory process for sealing or expunging criminal history records. Motions to Seal pleadings or court records filed in a criminal case must, however, comply with this Administrative Order. This administrative order also does NOT pertain to court records that are confidential pursuant to statute, rule or other legal authority.

11. If a motion to seal is not made in good faith and is not supported by a sound legal and factual basis, the court may impose sanctions upon the movant.

12. The Clerk of Court, or a deputy clerk, is hereby authorized to open any court file sealed by operation of law or court order for the purpose of filing documents pertinent to the particular file, as well as for microfilming or imaging files, and for preparing a record on appeal. The Clerk, or deputy clerk, shall reseal the file immediately upon completion of the task, with the date and time of the unsealing clearly marked on the outside of the file along with the initials of the deputy clerk.

13. In all matters except adoption and surrogacy cases, the Clerk of Court will make the contents of a sealed file available to adult parties and their attorneys of record. The contents of adoption and surrogacy files shall not be made available to any person absent a court order.

DONE AND SIGNED in Chambers in West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida this 29 day of September, 2008.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY FLORIDA

ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2.032 - 10/06*

IN RE: SEALING COURT HEARINGS AND RECORDS

WHEREAS all court proceedings are public events and a strong presumption of public access attaches to all proceedings and their records; and

WHEREAS records made or received pursuant to court rule, law, or ordinance, or in connection with the transaction of official business are subject to public disclosure; and

WHEREAS privacy rights of litigants may in certain circumstances require that court records or documents in the record should be sealed.

NOW, THEREFORE, it is ORDERED that to balance the competing interests of litigants' privacy interests and the public's right to access to court records, the following procedures are established for sealing court records:

1. When a Motion is received for the sealing of a hearing or all or part of a court record, the Court will direct a hearing be held on same. The Court will give notice of the hearing by posting same on the electronic bulletin board established by the Clerk of Court expressly for this purpose. Unless otherwise ordered with a reason given by the Court, notice should include enough disclosure to identify the case, the movant, the respondent, and a brief, generic description of the matters sealed or sought to be sealed.

2. The Court will not set a hearing less than ten (10) days prior to the notice being given to the public and the press.

3. Where prior notice to the public and press regarding the sealing of a record is not practicable, the Court will address such Motion, and if granted, provide notice of any decision to seal on the Clerk's electronic bulletin board. Unless otherwise ordered with a reason given by the Court, notice should include enough disclosure to identify the case, the movant, the respondent, and a brief, generic description of the matters sealed or sought to be sealed.

4. Access to court proceedings and records may be restricted to protect the interests of litigants only after a showing that the following has been met:

(i) the measure limiting or denying access, closure or sealing of records or both, is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the administration of justice;

(ii) no less restrictive alternative measures are available which would mitigate the danger; and
(iii) the measure being considered will in fact achieve the court's protective purpose.

5. The reasons supporting sealing the file must be stated with specificity in the order sealing the court record or hearing. The Case number should remain accessible on banner** regardless of whether the case has been sealed.

DONE and ORDERED, in Chambers, at West Palm Beach, Florida this 13th day of October, 2006.

Judge Kathleen J. Kroll, Chief Judge

* supersedes administrative order no. 2.032 - 7/04

OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO CLOSE TRIAL

RICHARD B. ORFINGER, Circuit Judge.

*1 THIS MATTER is before the Court on the plaintiffs' motion to exclude the public from the trial of this case. Notice of hearing was given to representatives of the media as required by law. News-Journal Corporation, publisher of The News-Journal, filed a response and appeared in opposition to the motion. Defendant took no position.

According to the complaint, a man who worked at the local museum sexually abused the minor plaintiffs. He had first come into contact with three of the minors as they served as volunteers under his supervision. More than four years ago, the abuser was prosecuted and sentenced to prison. Since then the plaintiffs have settled suits for damages resulting from this abuse against the Daytona Beach Museum of Arts and Sciences, the Volusia County School Board, and the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. As a previous employer of the abuser, plaintiffs allege this defendant failed to disclose information about the abuser's record of sexual abuse when it received an inquiry related to his employment in this community.

Although so many persons have become familiar with the case that defendant has listed eighty-one potential fact witnesses, no victim has yet been identified in the media.

Relying on a privacy interest in the facts relating to the sexual abuse, plaintiffs argue that closure is necessary to prevent the substantial harm that likely would result from revelation of these facts and identification as the victims. FN1 Thus the motion calls upon the court to decide whether a privacy interest in the facts relating to sexual abuse suffered by the minors provides a proper basis for closure of the trial of the minors' suit for damages arising out of this abuse. For the reasons that follow, the court concludes that this is not a proper basis for closure and denies the motion.

FN1. Previously, plaintiffs moved for an order restraining anyone, including the media, from publishing information disclosed during the trial that would identify the minor victims. The court denied this motion. See: Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976) and The Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524 (1989).

Whenever other interests compete with the public interest in open judicial proceedings, "[o]ur analysis must begin with the proposition that all civil and criminal court proceedings are public events, records of court proceedings are public records, and there is a strong presumption in favor of public access to such matters." Sentinel Communications Co. v. Watson, 615 So.2d 768, 770 (Fla. 5th DCA 1993) (citing Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla.1988)). This presumption rests on the most fundamental values of American government.

(Cite as: 1994 WL 741009 (Fla.Cir.Ct.))

"[T]he people have a right to know what is done in their courts... [T]he greatest publicity to the acts of those holding positions of public trust, and the greatest freedom in the discussion of the proceedings of public tribunals that is consistent with truth and decency, are regarded as essential to the public welfare." *Barron*, 531 So.2d at 116-7 (citing *In re Shortridge*, 34 P. 227, 228-29 (Cal.1893)). Openness in courts has a salutary effect on the propensity of witnesses to tell the truth and of judicial officers to perform their duties conscientiously. It informs persons affected by litigation of its effect upon them and fosters "respect for the law[,] intelligent acquaintance ... with the methods of government[, and] a strong confidence in judicial remedies ... which could never be inspired by a system of secrecy..." *Id.*, (citing 6 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 1834 (Chadbourn rev.1976)). These fundamental values come into play whenever the court is in session, and the presumption of openness applies in hard cases as well as easy cases. "The reason for openness is basic to our form of government." *Id.*

*2 This motion is opposed by various news organizations, but the presumption of openness is of larger importance than the immediate interest of the press in the case of the moment. To be sure, the press has a cognizable interest in maintaining open courts "because its ability to gather news is directly impaired or curtailed" by restrictions on access. Moreover, the press is assigned a fiduciary role in enforcing public rights of access because the press "may be properly considered as a representative of the public [for] enforcement of public right of access." Nevertheless, the values of openness in courts transcend the interests of the press because "[f]reedom of the press is not, and has never been a private property right granted to those who own the news media. It is a cherished and almost sacred right of each citizen to be informed about current events on a timely basis so each can exercise his discretion in determining the destiny and security of himself, other people, and the Nation." *State ex rel. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. McIntosh*, 340 So.2d 904, 908 (Fla.1977). In serving the right of each citizen to be informed, judicial openness, of which the press is an instrument, sustains public confidence in the judiciary and thus serves the ultimate value of popular sovereignty.

This higher purpose of openness is not always apparent in the public scrutiny of the daily business of the courts. Depending on the definition of newsworthiness, it may be possible to dismiss as unworthy much that transpires in civil courts. Here, it is easy to ask what public interest is served by subjecting these minor victims to the risk of public identification. However, *Barron* teaches that this is the wrong question because it overlooks the higher purpose of openness in the courts.

In *Barron*, a case involving privacy concerns inherent in a divorce case, the court strongly reaffirmed the presumption that Florida civil courts are open. In dissent, Justice McDonald saw the question in case-specific terms. He would have closed the proceeding because "the rights of the public to information contained in a domestic relations lawsuit is minimal, if existent at all." 531 So.2d at 121. Implicitly, this approach would have required the proponent of openness to show a particular need to know facts of the specific case in order to gain access. The majority rejected this approach because it saw the conflicting interests in broader terms. "The parties seeking a dissolution of their marriage are not entitled to a private court proceeding just because they are required to utilize the judicial system." 531 So.2d at 119.

A closure request implicates the integrity and credibility of the judicial system itself and not just the immediate concerns of the parties. The balance to be struck is not between the people's need to know the particular facts of the case versus the parties' need to keep these facts private but between the public interest in open courts versus the personal desire for a private forum. "Public trials are essential to the judicial system's credibility in a free society." *Barron* at 116.

"the public and the press have a fundamental right of access to all judicial proceedings," however, this right is not absolute. State ex rel. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. McIntosh, 340 So.2d at 908-9. In Barron, the court took the occasion to establish the standards upon which the presumption of openness may be overcome when necessary "to protect competing interests." The court wrote a "definitive statement ... to assist judicial officers in this sensitive area." 531 So.2d at 117-8.

Barron establishes a strong presumption of openness for all court proceedings and records, places the burden on the proponent of closure, and grants standing to the public and media to challenge closure orders. Before a court may enter any order of closure it must determine there are no reasonable alternatives to closure and must order the least restrictive closure necessary to accomplish the purpose of closure. 531 So.2d at 118-9. A closure order should be "drawn with particularity and narrowly applied." 531 So.2d at 117.

Barron specifies an exclusive listing of those competing interests that may under appropriate circumstances be sufficiently weighty to justify closure. Closure may be ordered "only when necessary" to serve one of six competing interests:

(a) to comply with established public policy set forth in the constitution, statutes, rules, or case law;
(b) to protect trade secrets;
(c) to protect a compelling governmental interest [e.g., national security; confidential informants];
(d) to obtain evidence to properly determine legal issues in a case;
(e) to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties [e.g., to protect young witnesses from offensive testimony; to protect children in a divorce]; or
(f) to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be closed...

At the outset, the proponent of closure must identify one or more of such interests that is implicated in the proposed closure. Here it is not necessary to go beyond this first level of analysis because plaintiffs have not connected their motion to a valid interest that would justify closure.

This motion poses a direct confrontation between the individual interest in privacy and the public interest in open courts. Because there is inherent in the case sensitive, intimate, and embarrassing private facts, plaintiffs seek to litigate their claim in a closed proceeding. They argue "[t]hat revelation of [the identities of the minor plaintiffs] has the potential to inflict substantial harm upon them [as] a matter of common sense."

There is no question there are strong reasons to keep private the facts surrounding the abuse practiced on the minors by the now-imprisoned abuser. The question this court must decide, however, is whether these are reasons to secure the courtroom. The question is not whether to afford privacy to the plaintiffs but whether to afford plaintiffs a closed forum in which to disclose these facts.

*4 Although there is no case directly on this point, the present question comes fully within the holding of Barron, which thoroughly considered the competition between the people's interest in public courts and the personal interest in private facts. In effect, Barron raised the question of the role to be assigned to privacy in a system of public courts, and the majority resolved the issue by granting a narrow role to privacy based on considerations relating to the legitimate expectations of privacy.

In the Florida Supreme Court's well-developed privacy jurisprudence, the fundamental basis of the right of privacy is a legitimate expectation of privacy. Not every fact in every circumstance is private, and not every act of government violates

the right to be let alone. The concept by which the court separates the appropriate from the inappropriate instance for invoking the privacy right is this expectation. *Stall v. State*, 570 So.2d 257, 261 (Fla.1990). In order to establish a right of privacy, the individual must establish that “a reasonable expectation of privacy ... exist[s].” *Winfield v. Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering*, 477 So.2d 544, 547 (Fla.1985).

A right of privacy cannot attach when there is no expectation of privacy. Under our historic tradition of public courts, what reasonable expectation of privacy could a litigant possibly entertain? Concurring in *Barron*, Justice Erhlich would have conceded the litigant no reasonable expectation of privacy. He pointed out, “we have ... recognized that ‘[t]he potential for invasion of privacy is inherent in the litigation process.’ *Rasmussen v. South Florida Blood Service*, 500 So.2d 533, 535 (Fla.1987). While civil litigants may have a legitimate expectation of privacy in pretrial depositions and interrogatories which are not filed with the court (citations omitted), no such expectation exists in connection with civil proceedings and court files which historically have been open to the public. See *Forsberg v. Housing Authority*, 455 So.2d 373, 375 (Fla.1984) (Overton, J., concurring) (there is traditionally no expectation of privacy in court files).” 531 So.2d at 120. Justice Erhlich shows the conflict between privacy and publicness. If the privacy interest were allowed unbounded scope, it would overcome the public nature of trials. Thus a system of public trials must insist that litigants abandon qualms about disclosure of private facts when they place them in contest in the court.

Without rejecting this view entirely, the majority nevertheless identified a limited scope of privacy within civil litigation. “We find that, under appropriate circumstances, the constitutional right of privacy established in Florida by the adoption of article I, section 23, could form a constitutional basis for closure under (e) or (f).” 531 So.2d at 118. The majority thus conceived of two instances in which a

reasonable expectation of privacy might be found.

*5 First, there is the privacy expectation of persons who are not parties to the case. Involuntary participants may have a reasonable claim of privacy. Thus under item (g), *Barron* recognizes that closure may be justified if the proponent carries the heavy burden of showing closure is necessary “to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties [e.g., to protect young witnesses from offensive testimony; to protect children in a divorce].” 531 So.2d at 118.

Second, there is the more limited privacy expectation of a party. Again, the doctrine of legitimate expectation is applicable. Although a litigant has no right to expect privacy in matters involved in the case litigated in a public court, there may be matters extrinsic to the case with respect to which a litigant has a reasonable privacy claim. Under *Barron*’s item (f), a proponent may be entitled to closure if he or she carries the burden of showing that closure is necessary “to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be closed.” 531 So.2d at 118.

*Barron* rules out closure based on privacy interests of parties in the subject matter of the case itself. In recognizing a peripheral role for the privacy claims of civil litigants, the majority held there can be no privacy interest in that which is inherent in the case. Because litigation in a public court system involves an inherent tendency to invade privacy, a litigant has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the subject matter of a case. This must be so if, as *Barron* soundly affirms, there is to be a system of open courts in Florida.

Applying this standard in *Barron*, the court determined the medical history in question should not be sealed because it was inherent in the case. “Although generally protected by one’s privacy right, medical reports and history are no longer protected when the medical condition becomes an integral part of the civil proceeding, particularly

when the condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure... [M]edical information is an inherent part of these proceedings and cannot be utilized as a proper basis for closure." 531 So.2d at 119.

The same is true in this case. Those private facts which form the basis of the motion for closure are the facts inherent in the plaintiffs' case. Nevertheless, plaintiffs argue their request implicates the competing interests Barron listed in item (a) dealing with public policy, item (e), dealing with privacy of third party, and item (f), dealing with privacy of a party.

Plaintiffs first argue that closure of the trial is necessary under item (a) "to comply with established public policy set forth in the constitution, statutes, rules, or case law." 531 So.2d at 118. Plaintiffs rightly contend "[t]he State of Florida has long recognized, as a matter of public policy, the need to protect minors who come into contact with the justice system," and cite statutory provisions exempting records of sex crimes and child abuse from public records disclosure and providing for closure of adoption and dependency proceedings. See Fla.Stat. §§ 119.07(h); 63.162; 39.408(e).

*6 To be sure, it is public policy to protect minor victims of sex crimes from unnecessary public exposure. The cited exceptions to public records laws illustrate this as does the practice of anonymous pleading.

However, state policy neither requires nor permits closure of public trials on the basis of the privacy interests of minor victims of sex crimes. The trial of the perpetrator of a sex crime against a minor must be conducted in public as a matter of Florida common law. 452 Under Fla.Stat., § 918.16, the court has a certain ability to clear the courtroom during testimony of a person under the age of 16, but the press specifically may not be excluded. 453 A recent statute protecting minor witnesses does not purport to authorize closure of the trial to protect minor witnesses. 454 When the state prosecutes the

parent of a minor child for sexual abuses practiced on the child, the trial is not closed nor is there suppression of the identity of the parent from which, as plaintiffs argue here, the identity of the child is readily inferred. 455 Indeed, from the reports of tort suits by minor victims of sexual crimes seeking damages from the perpetrator or those vicariously liable, it can be seen that the courts of this state conduct cases like the present as open public trials in the name of the party. 456

Metcalf, 543 So.2d 785 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989) (Suit by minors against psychologist for damages from abusive father when suspicion of abuse was not reported).

The court concludes that it is not necessary to close this trial in order to comply with any public policy of the State of Florida.

The plaintiffs next argue that closure is necessary to serve the interest of innocent third parties whose privacy warrants closure under item (e) of Barron. The plaintiffs assert that each minor in this consolidated cause is a third party as to the other three actions and thus the trial should be closed to protect them as third parties in the consolidated cases. Having voluntarily joined to bring the action, they cannot claim to be third parties to the action nor assert a legitimate expectation of privacy in the disclosures that necessarily follow from their decision to act in concert.

Plaintiffs also assert the privacy interest of other minors who were victims of this same abuse but who have not joined in this suit. There is no evidence that trial of this case would implicate these third parties. In any event, plaintiffs lack standing to assert the interest of these third parties, and the Court will not decide any issue affecting their rights unless a party with standing raises the issue.

Finally, plaintiffs attempt to bring their motion under item (f) relating to the privacy interest of a party. To be entitled to an order of closure under this item, however, plaintiffs must show that closure is necessary "to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of civil proceeding sought to be closed." 531 So.2d at 119 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue their identities are not inherent facts in the case and thus the trial should be closed to prevent revelation of the identity. However, plaintiffs also contend it will be impossible to try the case without revelation of their names. Their argument refutes itself. The identity of a party is inherent in the case, and that concern alone could not justify total closure. This argument is a proxy for the ineffective argument that the sensitive nature of inherent private facts should justify a private forum. Facts regarding abuse form the core of their case, and thus it "is an inherent part of these proceedings and cannot be utilized as a proper basis for closure." 531 So.2d at 119. The decision to litigate this issue is tantamount to a decision to place the information before the public.

*7 As sympathetic as their claim is, it fails to state a cognizable reason for closure under the law. The

request to close a civil trial because of a party's dis-
closural concerns with facts inherent in the cause
cannot be reconciled with Barron. Facts generally
protected by a party's privacy right are no longer
protected from disclosure when they become an in-
tegral part of a civil proceeding. Indeed, plaintiffs'
argument for a private forum could be asserted as
the basis for a wide array of exceptions that would
swallow up the presumption of openness. "The ...

**GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO VICTIM’S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.C. § 3771**

The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, files its Response to Victim’s Emergency Petition for Enforcement of Victim Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and states:

### 1. THERE IS NO “COURT PROCEEDING” UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)

Petitioner complains that she has been denied her rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. In the emergency petition filed by the victim, she alleges the Government has denied her rights since she has received no consultation with the attorney for the government regarding possible disposition of the charges (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5)); no notice of any public court proceedings (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)); no information regarding her right to restitution (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(6)); and no notice of rights under the Crime Victim Rights Act (CVRA).

**Emergency Petition, ¶ 5.**

The instant case is unique in several respects. First, in 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with felony solicitation of prostitution in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida. This charge was based upon the offenses alleged in paragraph 1 of the petition. Second, while Epstein has been under federal investigation, he has not been charged in

the Southern District of Florida.

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 3771(b)(1) provides in pertinent part that, “[i]n any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in subsection (a).” There is no “court proceeding” in the instant case since Epstein has not been charged with violation of any federal statute. No federal grand jury indictment has been returned, nor has any criminal information been filed. There can thus be no failure of a right to notice of a public court proceeding or the right to restitution.

In her memorandum, petitioner relies upon *In Re Dean*, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008), where the Fifth Circuit held that the CVRA required the government to “confer in some reasonable way with the victims before ultimately exercising its broad discretion.” *Id.* at 395. In *Dean*, the government sought and obtained an *ex parte* order permitting it to negotiate a plea agreement with BP Products North America, without first consulting with the victims, individuals injured and survivors of those killed in a refinery explosion. A plea agreement was ultimately negotiated and the victims objected. The appellate court found that the CVRA granted a right to confer. However, the court declined to grant mandamus relief for prudential reasons, finding that the district court had the benefit of the views of the victims who chose to participate at the hearing held on whether the plea agreement should be accepted. *Id.* at 396.

*Dean* is legally distinguishable in several respects. For one thing, the court’s discussion of the scope of the right to confer was unnecessary because the court ultimately declined to issue mandamus relief. *Dean*, 527 F.3d at 395. Also, in offering its view that this right applies pre-charge, it is noteworthy that the court, in purporting to quote the statute, omitted the last three words of section 3771(a)(5)(“in the case”), words that arguably point in the opposite direction by

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 13 Entered on FLSD Doc... 07/15/2008 Page 3 of 8

suggesting that the right applies post-charge. Further, the court went to great lengths to emphasize that its holding was limited to the particular circumstances presented in that case (i.e., the simultaneous filing of a plea agreement and formal charges), which of course, is not the case here. No federal charges have been filed in the instant case, and this case, unlike Dean, involves an agreement to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida and not a guilty plea. Id. at 394. Finally, the Dean court expressly declined to “speculate on the [right to confer’s] applicability to other situations.” Id. Nothing in § 3771(a)(5) supports the petitioner’s claim that she had a right to be consulted before the Government could enter into a non-prosecution agreement which defers federal prosecution in exchange for state court resolution of criminal liability, and a significant concession on an element of a claim for compensation under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.

## II. THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED ITS BEST EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)

The Epstein case was investigated initially by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2006. Exhibit A, Declaration of Assistant United States Attorney A. Marie Villafaña, ¶ 2. Subsequently, the Palm Beach Police Department sought the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Id. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters were provided to the victim by both the FBI Victim-Witness Specialist and AUSA Villafaña. Id., ¶ 3. Petitioner’s counsel, Brad Edwards, Esq., currently represents [redacted], and [redacted]. The U.S. Attorney’s Office victim notification letter to [redacted] was provided by the FBI, and the letter to [redacted] was hand-delivered by AUSA Villafaña to her when she was interviewed in April 2007. FBI victim notification letters were mailed to [redacted] and [redacted] on

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 13 Entered on FLSD Doc .07/15/2008 Page 4 of 8

January 10, 2008, and to [REDACTED] on May 30, 2008. Villafaña Decl., ¶ 3.

Throughout the investigation, AUSA Villafaña and the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist had contact with [REDACTED] Villafaña Decl., ¶ 4. Earlier in the investigation, [REDACTED] was represented by James Eisenberg, Esq. Consequently, all contact with [REDACTED] was made through Mr. Eisenberg.

In mid-2007, Epstein’s attorneys approached the U.S. Attorney’s Office in an effort to resolve the federal investigation. Id., ¶ 5. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein’s attorneys sought a global resolution of this matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (May 2005), Article

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 13 Entered on FLSD Doc... 07/15/2008 Page 5 of 8

IV, Services to Victims and Witnesses, provides the following guidance for proposed plea agreements:

(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not limited to, the following factors:

(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.
(b) The number of victims.
(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions.
(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality.
(f) Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant's right to a fair trial.

Throughout negotiations, Epstein’s attorneys claimed that one reason victims came forward and pressed their claims was their desire for money. They argued that victims might have an inducement to fabricate or enhance their testimony, in order to maximize their opportunities to obtain financial recompense. Villafaña Decl., ¶ 8. The Government was extremely concerned that disclosure of the proposed terms would compromise the investigation by providing Epstein the means of impeaching the victim witnesses, should the parties fail to reach an agreement. In light of the fact (i) that the United States agreed to defer prosecution to a previously filed state criminal case; (ii) that as a result sentencing would take place in state court before a state judge; (iii) that if the state resolution failed to meet minimum standards such that a federal prosecution was warranted, the victims would be witnesses and thus potential

- 5 -

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 13 Entered on FLSD Doc... 07/15/2008 Page 6 of 8

impeachment issues were of concern; and (iv) the United States was already making efforts to secure for victims the right to proceed federally under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 even if prosecution took place in state court, the Government determined that its actions in proceeding with this agreement best balanced the dual position of the Jane Does as both victims and potential witnesses in a criminal proceeding.

On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafaña received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement, and learned that Epstein’s state plea hearing was scheduled for Monday, June 30, 2008, at 8:30 a.m. Villafaña Decl., ¶ 10. AUSA Villafaña and the Palm Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that they had. Id. Although all known victims were not notified, AUSA Villafaña did call attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. AUSA Villafaña did this, even though she had no obligation to provide notice of a state court hearing. Mr. Edwards advised that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Id.

The Government has complied with 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) by using its best efforts to “see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a).” Specifically, petitioner was afforded the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). Disclosure of the specific terms of the negotiation were not disclosed prior to a final agreement being reached because the Government believed doing so would jeopardize and prejudice the prosecution in the event an agreement could not be made. Further, although 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2) does not apply to state court proceedings, the government nonetheless notified petitioner’s counsel on June 27, 2008, of the plea hearing in state court on June 30, 2008.

Section 3771(d)(6) provides, in relevant part, that “[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.” The Government exercised its judgment and discretion in determining that there was a need for confidentiality in the negotiations with Epstein. The significant benefit of obtaining Epstein’s concession that victims suing him under 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a) were “victims” of the enumerated offenses, despite the fact he has not been convicted in federal court, was of sufficient importance to justify confidentiality of the negotiations.

### III. THE GOVERNMENT’S DISCUSSIONS WITH [REDACTED], AND [REDACTED]

Attorney Brad Edwards has advised the Government that he represents [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] Victim letters were provided to all three individuals. The letters to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] were forwarded on January 10, 2008. Villafaña Decl., ¶ 3. On May 28, 2008, [REDACTED] status as a victim was confirmed when she was interviewed by federal agents. Id. The FBI Victim Witness specialist sent her a letter on May 30, 2008. Id.

When the agreement was signed in September 2007, [REDACTED] was openly hostile to a prosecution of Epstein, and [REDACTED] had refused to speak with federal investigators. Id., ¶ 7. While individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, none of Mr. Edwards’ clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. Id.

In October 2007, [REDACTED] was not represented by counsel. Id., ¶ 8. She was given telephonic notice of the agreement, as were three other victims. Id. These four individuals were also given notice of an expected change of plea, in state court, in October 2007.

In mid-June 2008, Mr. Edwards contacted AUSA Villafaña to advise that he represented [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] and requested a meeting. Id., ¶ 9. AUSA Villafaña asked Mr. Edwards to send

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 13 Entered on FLSD Doc. 07/15/2008 Page 8 of 8

to her any information that he wished her to consider. Nothing was provided. *Id.* AUSA Villafaña also told Mr. Edwards he could contact the State Attorney’s Office, if he wished. To her knowledge, Mr. Edwards did not make the contact.

The Government has acted reasonably in keeping [redacted], and [redacted] informed. Petitioner’s rights under the CVRA have not been violated. Therefore, her emergency petition should be denied.

**DECLARATION OF A. MARIE VILLAFAÑA**
**IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES' RESPONSE**
**TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT**
**OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.C. § 3771**

1. I, A. Marie Villafaña, do hereby declare that I am a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Florida. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the Hon. David F. Levi in Sacramento, California, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am admitted to practice in all courts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida, the District of Minnesota, and the Northern District of California. My bar admission status in California and Minnesota is currently inactive. I am currently employed as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and was so employed during all of the events described herein.

8/AB

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Doc. 07/15/2008 Page 2 of 21

2. I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses.

3. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards’ three clients, [redacted], and [redacted]. Your Affiant’s letter to [redacted] was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 1). Your Affiant’s letter to [redacted] was hand-delivered by myself to [redacted] at the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2).² Both [redacted] and [redacted] also received letters from the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 2008 (Exs. 3 &amp; 4). [redacted] was identified via the FBI’s investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. [redacted] status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by [redacted].

Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of “Jane Doe,” without identifying which of his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to [redacted], and [redacted]. All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old.

²Please note that the dates on the U.S. Attorney’s Office letters to [redacted] and [redacted] are not the dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Doc... 07/15/2008 Page 3 of 21

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to [redacted] on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5).

4. Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with [redacted] and [redacted] Attorney Edwards' other client, [redacted], was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with [redacted] was made through that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation.³

5. In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (“the Office”) entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein’s attorneys sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein

³The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing [redacted] or whether [redacted] ever formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg’s representation.

-3-

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Doc 107/15/2008 Page 4 of 21

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

6. An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an express confidentiality provision.

7. Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, [redacted] was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted to interview [redacted] in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards’ clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation.

8. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions were discussed. One of those victims was [redacted] who at the time was not represented, and she was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When Epstein’s attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD DocNet 07/15/2008 Page 5 of 21

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant knew that the victims’ statements had been taken and corroborated with independent evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.

9. After [redacted] had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein performed his obligations, [redacted] contacted the FBI because Epstein’s counsel was attempting to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro bono counsel to represent [redacted] and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was able to assist [redacted] in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not express to your Affiant that [redacted] was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter.

10. In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he represented [redacted] and [redacted] and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the State Attorney’s Office, if he so wished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to [redacted] so I advised him that, to my knowledge, [redacted] was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Doc. 07/15/2008 Page 6 of 21

11. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein’s counsel had given us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented [redacted] and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards’ clients was present.

12. On today’s date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to [redacted] and [redacted] via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 &amp; 7). A notification was not provided to [redacted] because the U.S. Attorney’s modification limited Epstein’s liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light of [redacted] prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include [redacted] as a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to Epstein’s counsel.

13. Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/15/2008 Page 7 of 21

already received the Certification of Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and the United States Attorney to consider “vigorous enforcement” of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains no demand for the relief requested in the Emergency Petition.

14. I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 9th day of July, 2008.

Re:

Dear:

Your name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal crime. We appreciate your assistance and cooperation while we are investigating this case. We would like to make you aware of the victim services that may be available to you and to answer any questions you may have regarding the criminal justice process throughout the investigation. Our program is part of the FBI's effort to ensure the victims are treated with respect and are provided information about their rights under federal law. These rights include notification of the status of the case. The enclosed brochures provide information about the FBI's Victim Assistance Program, resources and instructions for accessing the Victim Notification System (VNS). VNS is designed to provide you with information regarding the status of your case.

This case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.

As a crime victim, you have the following rights under 18 United States Code § 3771: (1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law; (7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.

We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney's Office to ensure you are accorded those rights. You may also seek the advice of a private attorney with respect to these rights.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein/ ~~NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIM~~

Dear Mr. Edwards:

By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida asks that you provide the following notice to your client,

On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as “Epstein”) entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf-009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months’ imprisonment to be followed by an additional six months’ imprisonment, followed by twelve months of Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court.

In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.

One such condition to which Epstein has agreed is the following:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

Through this letter, this Office hereby provides Notice that your client, [redacted] is an individual whom the United States was prepared to name as a victim of an enumerated offense.

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 2 of 41

Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), Section 1595(b)(1), and alternatively, under this Court’s discretionary authority to stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action.

## Introduction

This lawsuit arises from a pending federal criminal action concerning, among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff Jane Doe, who, according to her complaint, on “numerous occasions” provided “massages” to Epstein with “no credentials to provide massage therapy” and was “sometimes paid . . . for the ‘sessions’.” Compl., ¶¶ 6, 11. A federal statute directly on point provides that when a civil suit alleging damages to a minor victim arises out of the same occurrence as a “criminal action,” the civil suit “shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action.” 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).¹

¹ The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads:

If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial court.

18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 3 of 41

Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the criminal action arising from the same allegations is no longer pending.

## The Pending Federal Criminal Action

In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the “Florida Criminal Action”). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO”) began a federal grand-jury investigation into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action (Grand Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida) (“the Federal Criminal Action”).

In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the “Agreement”), in which the USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. The Agreement itself uses the term “deferred” (rather than “dismissed” or “closed”) to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action:

THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by

the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement . . .

Agreement, at 2.

By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon the Federal Criminal Action. Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently explained, the USAO merely “agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida . . . .” See *In re: Jane Doe*, Case No. 08-80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (D.E. 14), Decl. of AUSA Villafana, 07/09/08, ¶ 5, attached hereto as Exhibit “A” (emphasis added). Under the Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein - or to unseal “any” already-existing federal “charges” that may already have been handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its provisions. Agreement, at 2.

The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. *Id.* Indeed, the final three months of the Agreement’s term constitute an extended period during which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict

(or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has completed serving his entire state sentence.

The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein’s execution of a plea agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action “will be suspended” and all pending grand-jury subpoenas “will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement.” Agreement, at 5 (emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to “maintain their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued,” and to maintain such evidence “inviolate.” *Id.* (emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas continue to remain “outstanding” until “the successful completion of the terms of this agreement.” *Id.* (emphasis added).

Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah Kellen, only if “Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[e] agreement.” *Id.*

Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO’s declination of prosecution for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence:

If the United States Attorney should determine, based on reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the

United States Attorney may, within ninety (90) days following the expiration of the term of home confinement discussed below, provide Epstein with timely notice specifying the condition(s) of the Agreement that he has violated, and shall initiate its prosecution on any offense within sixty (60) days’ of [sic] giving notice of the violation. Any notice provided to Epstein pursuant to this paragraph shall be provided within 60 days of the United States learning of facts which may provide a basis for a determination of a breach of the Agreement.

After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed.

Agreement, at 2.

Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal Action continues to remain pending, the USAO recently sent letters to attorneys for people that the USAO has designated as “victims.” In those letters, the USAO asked, “[I]f you do file a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and Mr. Epstein denies that your client is a victim of an enumerated offense, please provide notice of that denial to the undersigned [AUSA].” See Decl. of AUSA Villafana, Exhs. 6 &amp; 7, at 2 (July 9, 2008). The clear implication of the USAO’s request (by which the USAO appears to involve itself in the instant litigation, despite advising the recipients that it cannot “take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation,” id. at 2), is that the USAO believes that such denial might breach the Agreement.

Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Action remains “pending.”

## Discussion

### I. Section 3509(k) Imposes a Mandatory Stay.

The language of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) is clear and mandatory: a parallel “civil action *shall be stayed* until the end of all phases of the criminal action.” 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added). The word “*shall*” means that the statute’s command is mandatory and not subject to a Court’s discretion. See, e.g., *Lopez v. Davis*, 531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001) (noting Congress’ “use of a mandatory ‘shall’ to impose *discretionless obligations*”) (emphasis added); *Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach*, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) (explaining that “the mandatory ‘shall’ . . . normally creates an obligation *impervious to judicial discretion*”) (emphasis added). Cf. *Miller v. French*, 530 U.S. 327, 350 (2000) (construing the litigation-stay provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, holding, “Through the PLRA, Congress clearly intended to make operation of the automatic stay *mandatory*, precluding courts from exercising their equitable powers to enjoin the stay. And we conclude that this provision does not violate separation of powers principles.”) (emphasis added).

One District Court within the Eleventh Circuit recently construed “the plain language of § 3509(k)” as “*requiring a stay* in a case . . . where . . . a parallel criminal action [is] pending.” *Doe v. Francis*, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 950623,

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 8 of 41

at *2 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 20, 2005) (Francis II) (emphasis added). Accord Doe v. Francis, No. 5:03 CV 260, 2005 WL 517847, at *1–2 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005) (Francis I) (staying federal civil action in favor of “a criminal case currently pending in state court in Bay County, Florida, arising from the same facts and involving the same parties as the Instant action,” noting that “the language of 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) is clear that *a stay is required* in a case such as this where a parallel criminal action is pending which arises from the same occurrence involving minor victims”) (emphasis added). There is no contrary opinion from any court.

In determining that the federal stay provision is mandatory, the Francis II court expressed that there was apparently no case law supporting, or even “discussing the [avoidance] of a stay [under the command of] § 3509(k).” Francis II, 2005 WL 950623, at *2. Deferring to the statute as written, the Francis II court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that some of the alleged victims had already reached their majority. See id. The court similarly rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that it would be in the victims’ best interests to avoid a stay so as to counteract the victims’ “ongoing and increasing mental harm due to the ‘frustrating delay in both the criminal case and [the civil] case.’” Id.

## II. Section 3509(k) Applies to Investigations, Not Just Indictments.

While there is no unsealed indicted criminal case against Mr. Epstein, the government’s criminal investigation against him remains open. Section 3509(k) clearly applies to stay civil cases during the pendency, not only of indicted criminal cases, but also of pre-indictment criminal investigations.

The term “criminal action” is not expressly defined in § 3509(k). It is defined, however, by a closely related statute. Title 18, U.S.C. § 1595 provides a civil remedy for “forced labor” and “sex trafficking” violations, but stays such actions “during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim.”² In enacting § 1595, Congress

² The full text of that statute provides:

§ 1595. Civil remedy

(a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of section 1589, 1590, or 1591 of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator in an appropriate district court of the United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees.

(b) (1) Any civil action filed under this section shall be stayed during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim.

(2) In this subsection, a “criminal action” includes investigation and prosecution and is pending until final adjudication in the trial court.

18 U.S.C. § 1595.

Lewis Tein PL
3059 GRAND AVENUE, SUITE 340, COCONUT GROVE, FLORIDA 33133

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 10 of 41

specifically intended that the term “criminal action” would be applied extremely broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to ensure that courts would give it the broadest possible construction and, for that reason, specified in the definition provision that “criminal action” also “includes investigation.” 18 U.S.C. § 1595(b)(2). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it according to its plain language. See *Ara v. Khan*, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 1726456, *2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 2007) (ordering “all proceedings in this case stayed pending the conclusion of the government’s criminal investigation of the defendants and of *any* resulting criminal prosecution”) (emphasis added).

Given that the USAO’s Agreement with Epstein indicates that:

- the grand-jury’s subpoenas remain “outstanding” (Agreement, at 5);
- the subpoenas are “h[e]ld . . . in abeyance” (id.);
- the subpoenas are not “withdrawn” (id.);
- the parties must “maintain their evidence” (id.) (which would be entirely unnecessary if the investigation against Epstein were closed);
- “any” existing “charges” will not “be dismissed” until after Epstein has “timely fulfill[ed] all the terms and conditions of the Agreement” (id. at 2) (emphasis added); and
- “prosecution in this District . . . shall be deferred” (id.) (but not closed or dismissed) - -

then the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains “pending.”

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 11 of 41

The ordinary meaning of the adjective “pending” is “[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision . . .” *Black’s Law Dictionary* 1154 (8th ed. 2004).³ See also *White v. Klitzkie*, 281 F.3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on *Black’s Law Dictionary*, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of “pending” as “awaiting decision”); *Swartz v. Meyers*, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying on *Black’s Law Dictionary* for the definition of “pending,” expressly because “pending” is not defined in the statute”). Any common-sense reading of the Agreement and the USAO’s recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the Federal Criminal Action’s “remaining undecided” and “awaiting decision.” See *Unified Gov’t of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers*, LLC, No. S07G1133, __S.E.2d __, 2008 WL 2579238, *3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a public-records request against Georgia’s “pending investigation” exception to its open-records law, and holding that “a seemingly inactive investigation which has not yet resulted in a prosecution logically “remains undecided,” and is therefore “pending,” until it “is concluded and the file closed”) (emphasis added).

³ The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on *Black’s Law Dictionary* for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., *United States v. Young*, 528 F.3d 1294, 1297 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008) (definitions of criminal “complaint” and “indictment”); *United States v. Brown*, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of “knowingly” in criminal statute).

### III. Section 3509(k) Applies Even After a Plaintiff Turns 18.

The parallel stay provision in § 1595, discussed *supra* at 8-9, mandates, without exception, that any civil action brought under that section for violation of § 1591 (prohibiting transportation of minors for prostitution) “shall be stayed during the pendency of any criminal action arising out of the same occurrence in which the claimant is the victim.” 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1). Whether the § 1595 plaintiff has turned 18 does not vitiate the efficacy of this mandatory stay.

An example illustrates why the stay provided in § 3509(k) has the same broad scope as the stay provided in § 1591(b)(1). As discussed above, § 3509(k) stays any civil suit for injury to a minor, arising out of the same occurrence as a pending criminal action. One type of civil suit falling within § 3509(k)’s ambit is a suit seeking redress for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Section 2423(a) -- just like § 1591 -- prohibits transportation of minors for prostitution. The elements of both statutes are identical. There would simply be no legitimate basis for Congress to differentiate between the consequences attached to violating these two sections. Thus, just as Congress mandated under § 1595(b)(1) that civil discovery shall be stayed when there is an ongoing federal investigation under § 1591 (even after the victim turns 18), the identical treatment should apply under § 3509(k) to civil actions brought for the identical violation of § 2423(a).

Logic compels a rule requiring continued application of the § 3509(k) stay to a putative victim who has since turned 18. Consider again the example of § 2243(a). Assume that the USAO is investigating a § 2243(a) violator with two alleged victims; one who is now 17, and one who has turned 19. Assume further that both decide to sue the alleged offender while the USAO is still in the process of conducting its criminal investigation. Why would Congress enact § 3509(k) to prohibit the defendant from conducting civil discovery in the 17-year-old’s lawsuit, but permit him to conduct full discovery in the 19-year-old’s lawsuit, including taking the depositions of both the 19- and the 17-year-old, the federal investigating agents and all the grand-jury witnesses? This could not have been Congress’ intent.

The legislative history to a statute resembling § 1595 is also instructive. When Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2255, it provided a civil remedy to any “minor . . . victim” of enumerated federal sex offenses. See Child Abuse Victims’ Rights Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-500, 100 Stat. 1783, § 703 (1986). In 2006, Congress amended the statute to clarify that the civil cause of action was available not just while the victim was a minor, but even after she or he turned 18. See Pub. L. 109-248, 120 Stat. 650, § 707 (b)(1)(A) (amending § 2255 to permit suit by adults who were victims of enumerated federal offenses when they were minors, by deleting “Any minor who is [a victim]” and adding “Any person, who, while a

completion of a criminal action. See also 18 USC § 3509(k).

H.R. Rep. 108-264(II), 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003), reprinted at 2003 WL 22272907, at *16-17 (“agency view” by the Department of Justice on bill later codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595).

The Department specifically argued to Congress in the clearest terms: “We believe that prosecutions should take priority over civil redress and that *prosecutions should be complete* prior to going forward with civil suits.” *Id.* at 17 (emphasis added). Nowhere did the Department suggest that pending prosecutions warrant *less* protection (i.e., should be “hinder[ed]”) simply because a particular civil plaintiff happens to reach his or her 18th birthday.

## IV. A Stay is Mandatory Despite Resulting “Delay” to Civil Lawsuits.

Inherent in any § 3509(k) stay is delay to the progress (discovery, trial, appeal) of *all* related civil lawsuits. Congress recognized this in enacting the stay provision, which necessarily prioritized the interests of completing a criminal investigation and prosecution over the interests of a particular plaintiff in seeking personal pecuniary damages. Based on this reasoning, the *Francis II* court specifically refused to provide any relief to plaintiffs “simply because the state [criminal] matter is not progressing as fast as they would hope.” The court made this determination despite the plaintiffs’ complaints about the “frustrating delay” and that “the state criminal case ‘has languished for almost two years with no end

in sight,” finding that this “is a matter to be addressed in state [criminal] court.”

*Id.* Accordingly, the anticipated delay in this case, attendant to the term of the deferred-prosecution agreement, does not change the clear command of § 3509(k).

According to her own pleadings, the plaintiff waited seven years before filing this lawsuit, Compl. ¶¶ 2,6, and so cannot rightfully claim prejudice from additional temporary delay.

## V. Section 3509 Aside, a Discretionary Stay is Warranted.

Even, *arguendo*, were this Court not to apply the mandate of § 3509, a discretionary stay should still be entered during the pendency of the Federal Criminal Action. *SEC v. Healthsouth Corp.*, 261 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1326 (N.D. Ala. 2003) (“No question exists that this court has the power to stay a civil proceeding due to an active, parallel criminal investigation.”). Other federal statutes support such a stay — particularly when the criminal action may be adversely affected by the civil litigation. For example, under 18 U.S.C. § 2712(e)(1), “the court shall stay any action commenced [against the United States] if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the Government to conduct a related investigation or prosecution of a related criminal case.” Allowing this lawsuit to progress while Epstein remains subject to the Federal Criminal Action will prejudice him irrevocably and irreparably. As

provided below, there are several adverse effects to allowing this case to proceed while the Federal Criminal Action remains pending.

In this lawsuit, Epstein has a right to defend himself. In the Federal Criminal Action, Epstein has a right against self-incrimination.⁴ Without a stay, Epstein will be immediately forced to abandon one of these rights.

Should he choose his Fifth Amendment rights, he will expose himself to an adverse inference at the summary-judgment stage and at trial. See generally, *Wehling v. Columbia Broad. Sys*, 611 F.2d 1026, 1027 (5th Cir. 1980) (observing that “invocation of the privilege would be subject to the drawing of an adverse inference by the trier of fact”). On the other hand, should Epstein choose his right to defend himself in this lawsuit, the USAO will be able to use his responses at every stage of the discovery and trial process (e.g., his Answer, responses to document requests, responses to requests for admissions, sworn answers to interrogatories, answers to deposition questions, and trial testimony) to his detriment in the Federal Criminal Action.⁵

⁴ The privilege applies in “instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger” of criminal liability. *Hoffman v. United States*, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951).

⁵ This could give the USAO a tremendous advantage in prosecuting Epstein in the Federal Criminal Action. See Comment, *Using Equitable Powers to Coordinate Parallel Civil and Criminal Actions*, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1023, 1026 (1985) (observing that “the prosecutor may have access to detailed civil depositions of the accused witnesses, while the rules of criminal procedure bar the accused from deposing the prosecutor’s witnesses”).

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 17 of 41

In this lawsuit, even before civil discovery begins, under the Initial Disclosures required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and S.D. Fla. Local Rule 26.1, Epstein “must” disclose the identities of all the witnesses he would call in his defense to the Federal Criminal Action (Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(i)), copies of “all documents” he “may use to support [his] defenses” (Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii)), as well as the identity of “any” expert witness he “may use at trial,” along with mandatory disclosure of “a written report” containing “a complete statement of all opinions the [expert] will express and the basis and reasons for them” (Rule 26(a)(2)(A) and (B)(i)).

In contrast, in the pending Federal Criminal Action, which is governed exclusively by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the USAO would not be entitled to compel pre-trial production of any of this information. See Fed. R. Cr. P. 16(b)(1)(A), (C), and 16(b)(2); United States v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355-56 (11th Cir. 1991) (explaining act-of-production privilege).

Thus, absent a stay of this civil action, the USAO would receive fundamentally unfair access to defense information and highly prejudicial advance insight into criminal defense strategy. See Comment, 98 Harv. L. Rev. at 1030 (“To the extent that a prosecutor acquires evidence that was elicited from the accused in a parallel civil proceeding, the criminal process becomes less adversarial.”).

Case 9:08-cv-80811-KAM Document 33 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/07/2009 Page 18 of 41

Without a stay in place, discovery will proceed, including against third parties. Mr. Epstein will have no alternative but to issue subpoenas seeking evidence from state and federal law-enforcement officers. For example, Epstein is clearly entitled to discover evidence of prior statements (including inconsistent statements) given by witnesses whom law-enforcement has previously interviewed. See, e.g., Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that district court properly admitted testimony of prosecutor about prior inconsistent statements that witness made to the prosecutor). Likewise, Epstein may be entitled to discovery of relevant evidence that is in the present possession of the grand jury or other law-enforcement agencies. See, e.g., Simpson v. Hines, 729 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D. Tex. 1989) (“The grand jury has concluded its deliberations . . . . The need for secrecy of these specific tapes no longer outweighs other concerns.”); Golden Quality Ice Cream Co., Inc. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc., 87 F.R.D. 53, 59 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (“[W]here, as here, the grand jury has completed its work and all that is sought are those documents turned over to the grand jury by the corporations which are defendants in the civil case, the considerations . . . militating against disclosure are beside the point.”) (citing Douglas Oil Co. of Calif. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)).

In response to such third-party subpoenas to law-enforcement witnesses, we anticipate that it will be the government, not Mr. Epstein, who will object to

discovery in this civil case, until the final conclusion of the Federal Criminal Action.

## Conclusion

Because this lawsuit arises from the same allegations as the Federal Criminal Action, this Court should stay this lawsuit until that action is no longer pending.

# DECLARATION OF A. MARIE VILLAFAÑA IN SUPPORT OF UNITED STATES' RESPONSE TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.C. § 3771

1. I, A. Marie Villafaña, do hereby declare that I am a member in good standing of the Bar of the State of Florida. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the Hon. David F. Levi in Sacramento, California, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am admitted to practice in all courts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida, the District of Minnesota, and the Northern District of California. My bar admission status in California and Minnesota is currently inactive. I am currently employed as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and was so employed during all of the events described herein.

2. I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses.

3. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards’ three clients, [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted]. Your Affiant’s letter to [redacted] was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 1). Your Affiant’s letter to [redacted] was hand-delivered by myself to [redacted] at the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2).² Both [redacted] and [redacted] also received letters from the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 2008 (Exs. 3 &amp; 4). [redacted] was identified via the FBI’s investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators. [redacted] status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by [redacted].

² Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of “Jane Doe,” without identifying which of his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted]. All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old.

² Please note that the dates on the U.S. Attorney’s Office letters to [redacted], and [redacted], are not the dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.

federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to [redacted] on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5).

4. Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI’s Victim-Witness Specialist, and your Affiant had contact with [redacted] and [redacted]. Attorney Edwards’ other client, [redacted], was represented by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with [redacted] was made through that attorney. That attorney was James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation.³

5. In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“the Office”) entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein’s attorneys sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein

³The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing [redacted] or whether [redacted] ever formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg’s representation.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/15/2008 Page 4 of 21

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

6. An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an express confidentiality provision.

7. Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, [redacted] was openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted to interview [redacted] in October 2007, at which time she refused to provide any information regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards’ clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation.

8. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions were discussed. One of those victims was [redacted] who at the time was not represented, and she was given notice of the agreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When Epstein’s attorneys learned that some of the victims had been

notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your Affiant knew that the victims’ statements had been taken and corroborated with independent evidence well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.

9. After [redacted] had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein performed his obligations, [redacted] contacted the FBI because Epstein’s counsel was attempting to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro bono counsel to represent [redacted] and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was able to assist [redacted], in avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not express to your Affiant that [redacted] was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter.

10. In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he represented [redacted] and [redacted] and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the State Attorney’s Office, if he so wished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to [redacted] so I advised him that, to my knowledge, [redacted] was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 14 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/15/2008 Page 6 of 21

11. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to victims in the short time that Epstein’s counsel had given us. Although all known victims were not notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards notified me that he represented [redacted] and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney Edwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the hearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards’ clients was present.

12. On today’s date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to [redacted] and [redacted] via their attorney, Bradley Edwards (Exs. 6 &amp; 7). A notification was not provided to [redacted] because the U.S. Attorney’s modification limited Epstein’s liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an indictment. In light of [redacted] prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith include [redacted] as a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to Epstein’s counsel.

13. Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had

already received the Certification of Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and the United States Attorney to consider “vigorous enforcement” of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains no demand for the relief requested in the Emergency Petition.

14. I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 9th day of July, 2008.

Miss [Redacted]

Re: Crime Victims’ and Witnesses’ Rights

Dear Miss [Redacted]

Pursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004, as a victim and/or witness of a federal offense, you have a number of rights. Those rights are:

1. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
2. The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.
3. The right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding, unless the court determines that your testimony may be materially altered if you are present for other portions of a proceeding.
4. The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, or sentencing.
5. The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the case.
6. The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.
7. The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.
8. The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.

Members of the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal investigative agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, must use their best efforts to make sure that these rights are protected. If you have any concerns in this regard, please feel free to contact me at 561 209-1047, or Special Agent Nesbitt Kuyrkendall from the Federal Bureau of Investigation at 561 822-5946. You also can contact the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C. at 202-307-5983. That Office has a website at www.ovc.gov.

You can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights listed above and, if you believe that the rights set forth above are being violated, you have the right to petition the Court for relief.

If you or your family is subjected to any intimidation or harassment, please contact Special Agent Kuyrkendall or myself immediately. It is possible that someone working on behalf of the targets of the investigation may contact you. Such contact does not violate the law. However, if you are contacted, you have the choice of speaking to that person or refusing to do so. If you refuse and feel that you are being threatened or harassed, then please contact Special Agent Kuyrkendall or myself.

You also are entitled to notification of upcoming case events. At this time, your case is under investigation. If anyone is charged in connection with the investigation, you will be notified.

**Re: Crime Victims’ and Witnesses’ Rights**

**Dear Miss**

Pursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004, as a victim and/or witness of a federal offense, you have a number of rights. Those rights are:

1. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
2. The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.
3. The right not to be excluded from any public court proceeding, unless the court determines that your testimony may be materially altered if you are present for other portions of a proceeding.
4. The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, or sentencing.
5. The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the case.
6. The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.
7. The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.
8. The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.

Members of the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal investigative agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, must use their best efforts to make sure that these rights are protected. If you have any concerns in this regard, please feel free to contact me at 561 209-1047, or Special Agent Nesbitt Kuyrkendall from the Federal Bureau of Investigation at 561 822-5946. You also can contact the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime in Washington, D.C. at 202-307-5983. That Office has a website at www.ovc.gov.

You can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights listed above and, if you believe that the rights set forth above are being violated, you have the right to petition the Court for relief.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein — NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIM

Dear Mr. Edwards:

By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida asks that you provide the following notice to your client:

On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as “Epstein”) entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf-009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months’ imprisonment to be followed by an additional six months’ imprisonment, followed by twelve months of Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court.

In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.

One such condition to which Epstein has agreed is the following:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein

had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

Through this letter, this Office hereby provides Notice that your client [redacted] is an individual whom the United States was prepared to name as a victim of an enumerated offense.

Should your client decide to file a claim against Jeffrey Epstein, his attorney, Jack Goldberger, asks that you contact him at Atterbury Goldberger and Weiss, 250 Australian Avenue South, Suite 1400, West Palm Beach, FL 33401, (561) 659-8300.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND JUDICIAL CIRCUIT IN AND FOR LEON COUNTY, FLORIDA

FILED
IN CLERK'S OFFICE
APR 24 2 10 PM '74

CLERK
U.S. DISTRICT COURT
HARTFORD, CONN

FLORIDA SUGAR CANE LEAGUE, INC.
Plaintiff,
vs.
FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION,
Defendant.

Case Number: 91-2108

ORDER

This cause is before the Court on the Complaint of the Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc. ("League"). The League seeks an order requiring a state agency, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation ("DER"), to release certain documents under its custody and control, pursuant to the Florida Public Records Act, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes. The facts in this case are as follows:

DER is a Defendant in the case styled United States v. South Florida Water Management District, et al., Case No. 88-1886-CIV-Hoeveler, United States District Court, Southern District of Florida ("U.S. v. SFWMD"). DER, as a Defendant in that case, entered into settlement negotiations with the plaintiff as represented by the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"). During the negotiations, drafts of proposed settlement agreements and other information relating to the settlement proposal were made, sent or received by DER to and from federal agencies and representatives, including DOJ. DER also entered into an agreement with DOJ to keep all documents it received during the settlement negotiations confidential.

265

OR1517P0555

On May 21, 1991, the League made a public records request for a draft of the Settlement Agreement which the Secretary of DER had publicly stated as having been received by DER. On May 28, 1991, DER responded to the League's request by refusing to disclose the requested document claiming the document was privileged and immune to discovery. On May 31, 1991, the League filed this action, pursuant to Chapter 119, Florida Statutes. A hearing was originally scheduled before this Court for June 5, 1991, but DER removed the case to federal district court, where it was ultimately transferred to the Southern District of Florida. The League filed a Motion to Quash DER's Notice of Removal, which motion was argued before Judge William Hoeveler on July 10, 1991, and was granted on September 10, 1991. The federal court held that there was no federal jurisdiction over the matter as the League's claim arises purely under state law, and Judge Hoeveler remanded the case back to this Court. A hearing was held before this Court on September 16, 1991. Attorneys for the parties appeared and argued their respective positions. DOJ also appeared, pursuant to title 28, United States Codes, section 517, to argue in support of DER and to advise the Court of the United States' asserted interest in keeping the documents from public disclosure. DER asserts that Florida's Public Records Act is not applicable in this matter because it has been preempted by "federal immunities and privileges." DER further claims that it has contractually vowed to the United States to withhold requested documents under the confidentiality agreement

266

DR1517PC0556

into which it entered with DOJ, and that DER is acting as DOJ's agent in withholding the documents from public disclosure.

This Court rejects these arguments. Florida's public records law is sweeping in its breadth and requires virtually unfettered public access to records in the custody of state agencies. Unless a statutorily provided exemption permits nondisclosure of public records, Florida law requires that all such records in the custody of state agencies be open and available for public inspection. The parties agreed that there is no statutory exemption in the Florida Public Records Act which would prevent disclosure of public records received by state agencies during settlement negotiations in U.S. v. SFWMD, including the records sought by the League in this case. DER has cited no applicable statutory exemption in the Florida Public Records Act, and the judiciary is without any authority to expand or create an exemption to Florida's public records law. Wait v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., 372 So. 2d 420 (Fla. 1979); Times Publishing Co. v. City of St. Petersburg, 558 So. 2d 487 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990).

Principles of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause may, in limited circumstances, act to prevent application of Florida's public records law where there is a clear conflict with an express requirement of confidentiality provided in a federal statute. See Cummer v. Pace, 159 So. 2d 679, 681-82 (Fla. 1935); see generally, pp. 81-82, Florida's Government-in-the-Sunshine Manual, Office of the Attorney General (1991). In this case, although DER claims preemption under federal law of privileges and

267

L.1517N0557

immunities, it has cited no specific federal statute which clearly requires that the documents in question be kept confidential.

DER also relies on DOJ's assertion that the documents would not be "discoverable" from DOJ in the pending case, and that documents are exempt from disclosure by DOJ under FOIA. Even assuming that were true, it is irrelevant to the application of Florida's public records law to documents in the custody of Florida's state agencies. As stated by Judge Hoeveler in remanding this action:

Thus, while FOIA may provide an independent cause of action insofar as the document in dispute is also in the custody of a federal agency, i.e., the Department of Justice, it cannot be said to displace and supplant a state statute directed at state agencies and state records. (Hoeveler Order at p. 12.)

DER's reliance on its confidentiality agreement with DOJ is equally misplaced. A state agency cannot bargain away its Public Records Act duties or create a "self-exemption" with a promise to third parties to keep records from disclosure to the public. Tribune Co. v. Hardee Memorial Hospital, Case No. CA-91-370, Tenth Judicial Circuit in and for Hardee County, Florida. See also Browning v. Walton, 351 So. 2d 380 (Fla. 4th DCA 1977).

THEREFORE, it is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that:

1. Settlement agreements made or received at any time by DER in connection with U.S. v. SFWMD are hereby declared to be public records subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes.

2. The Federal Freedom of Information Act, title 5, United States Code, section 552, does not preempt Chapter 119, Florida

4

268

OR1517PC0558

Statutes, to exempt from public disclosure public records in the custody of Florida state agencies, including DER;

3. DER shall provide access to the League, within forty-eight hours of rendition of this Order, to inspect and examine any and all draft settlement agreements DER has withheld from public disclosure based on a claim of federal preemption;

4. If DER desires to appeal this Order, DER shall prepare and deliver to the clerk of this Court, for inclusion in the record under seal, at the time it files its notice of appeal, all draft settlement agreements exchanged with the DOJ relating to U.S. v.
