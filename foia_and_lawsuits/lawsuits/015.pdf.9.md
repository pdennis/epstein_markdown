# ORDER REQUESTING THE UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE ITS POSITION REGARDING DEFENDANT EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO STAY/CONTINUE THE CIVIL CASES PENDING AGAINST HIM

THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the motions filed in several cases by Defendant

Case 9:09-cv-80469-KAM Document 15 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/14/2009 Page 4 of 4

Jeffrey Epstein to Stay and/or Continue the Action for Time Certain Based on Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings. See, e.g., docket entry 51 in C.M.A. v. Epstein and Kellen, case no. 08-80811 (attached). Epstein moves for a stay until the expiration of the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") with the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) because, he claims, the USAO has taken the position that he is violating the NPA by defending the civil actions filed against him. Therefore, he argues that he cannot defend the civil actions without subjecting himself to criminal prosecution.

While the Court recognizes that the United States is not a party to these actions and is not obligated to comment on this matter, the position of the United States would greatly assist the Court in resolving the merits of these motions to continue/stay the case. Accordingly, the Court requests that the United States provide its position on the matter. The Court would appreciate the governments position within 15 days if possible. If the United States is unwilling to state its position, the Court would also appreciate being so advised.

DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida, this 14th day of May, 2009
