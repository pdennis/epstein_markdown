On February 15, 2006, I made telephone contact with [redacted] who provided directions to where I could locate her. Det Caristo and I responded to 806 Old Dixie Hwy in Lake Park to meet with [redacted]. Upon my arrival, I met with [redacted] in the parking lot directly behind MAACO Auto Painting. She was advised I was there to speak with her about an ongoing investigation that concerned Jeffrey Epstein in Palm Beach. [redacted] stated she knows Epstein very well and did not want to speak with me about Mr. Epstein. She was very fond of Epstein and did not want to speak with me about anything concerning Jeffrey Epstein. I explained to her that she was seen at the house and I would like to speak with her. She stated she knew there was an investigation and that I had spoken with other people and therefore I should know what happened at Epstein's house. [redacted] ended the conversation and walked back into her boyfriends business, Blanton Automotive. Det Caristo and I left the area and returned to the police station.

Investigation continues.

A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006, in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.

I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation. The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.

I continued to research other names that were acquired either from interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I

located [redacted] in [redacted]. During the interview, [redacted] stated she knew I would be speaking with her. [redacted] stated she was first introduced to Epstein when she turned eighteen years old. [redacted] stated she was sure of her age as it was her senior year in [redacted]. She advised she was brought there to make money and was told she would have to provide a massage to this Palm Beach guy. She remembered she met Epstein and his assistant Sarah in the kitchen area. She stated she was taken by one of her friends, [redacted]. She stated she went upstairs with Sarah while Epstein got ready for the massage. He exited his bathroom naked and [redacted] turned around. Epstein asked her if being naked offended her. [redacted] stated it made her uncomfortable. Epstein then put on a towel and lay on the table. [redacted] stated she rubbed his back and feet. She stated she had no massage training or experience. [redacted] stated during the massage, Epstein attempted to touch her buttocks. [redacted] pulled away as he touched her buttocks. She told him again she was uncomfortable with him touching her. Epstein then cut the massage short and became upset with her. Epstein paid her $200.00 for the massage and told her to leave the house. [redacted] never returned to the house. She did advise of one time she went with [redacted] however she waited in the car for [redacted] as she did not want to go into the house. At the conclusion of [redacted] visit with Epstein they left the area. [redacted] stated she had heard from other girls that have gone to the house that Epstein now required them to do the massage naked and allow him to touch them in their private areas for monies. The interview was concluded as [redacted] did not have any other information to provide.

I then learned from the original victim, [redacted] the defense attorney had learned of her identity. I spoke with the father of the victim, who stated there has been a private investigator on his house photographing his family and chasing visitors who come to the house. He provided a Florida License of E79-4EH. This vehicle is registered to Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. Robles is a private investigator intern who is licensed by the state. I informed the State Attorney's Office of the above information.

I received the Grand Jury subpoenas to be delivered to three victims for a Grand Jury session to be held on April 18, through April 20, 2006.

Investigation continues.

The subpoena was given to her mother,

I learned through one of the victims that she was personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein. The source assured she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. also stated she was told, "Those who help him will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with." I told that tampering with a witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her who approached her during this encounter. originally was reluctant to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not to testify because she felt they were still friends.

On April 11, 2006, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida and met with the victim, identified W/F, as the person who approached her in Royal Palm Beach while she was home during Spring Break in March 2006. also stated she did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on was concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy of the report as certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by Beal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her subpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18, 2006.

Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by the defense.

On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury.

At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic in their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors. When asked about the all the other victims, ASA Belohlavic stated that was the only offer made as to one victim, ASA Belohlavic cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as

Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the deal offered.

I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from stepmother for the victim. She was calling because the State Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done.

On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason they were no longer needed.

As I had not received any contact from anyone at the State Attorney's Office, on May 1, 2006, I prepared three arrest warrant requests and submitted them to the State Attorney's Office. The packages were delivered to the Crimes against Children Unit in care of ASA Lana Belohlavek. Jeffrey Epstein's arrest warrant was requested for 4 counts of Unlawful Sexual activity with certain minors and one count of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation.

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate, Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration, was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence, 358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida registration of F30QQF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr. Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane. We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of the executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on the 10th at 5:00 pm.

On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to her I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen, and Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or direct file, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to the Grand Jury. I explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had concluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the case to go forward. Belohlavek stated the original offer was again offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.

On May 22, 2006, I received several phone calls throughout the day from Mr. [redacted] who stated he had been followed aggressively by a private investigator. Mr. [redacted] stated that as he drove to and from work and running errands throughout the county, the same vehicle was behind him running other vehicles off the road in an attempt not to lose sight of Mr. [redacted] vehicle.

I explained to him as Mr. Epstein had retained new legal council it was possible it would be new private investigators following him to observe his daily activities. I also explained to him that there was a meeting scheduled with ASA Lana Belohlavek and Attorney Jack Goldberger at Mr. Krischer's office scheduled on June 1, 2006 at 9:00 am. I attempted to call ASA Lana Belohlavek to inform her of the private investigators following Mr. [redacted] however; she was on her vacation during the week of May 22 through May 30 2006.

On May 23, 2006, I received other phone calls from Mr. and Mrs. [redacted] who advised they were able to acquire the private investigators license plate information. The subject following them was again driving very aggressively and caused Mrs. [redacted] to run off the road.

Bechard is employed with Candor Investigations from Jupiter, Florida. Bechard is a licensed Private Investigator in the State of Florida.

Since the discovery of the threat made against one of the victims in this case [redacted], I requested subpoenas for all calls made to and received from [redacted] during the month of March 2006 for her cell phone and home phone. I had confirmed with Florida State University the exact dates of Spring Break for 2006. The Spring Break was from March 4, 2006 through March 12, 2006. I received a subpoena from Sprint/Nextel with all calls made during the month of March 2006. I reviewed the 989 calls made and received during the month of March 2006. I observed on March 7, 2006, [redacted] made and received thirty five calls during that day.

A call is then immediately received, a telephone number registered to a Corporation affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein located at 457 Madison Ave in New York. An extensive computer check revealed 457 Madison Ave is a business address in which Epstein has his corporations assigned to. Epstein had corporation attorney, Darren Indyke, register the businesses and register himself as an agent. I also observed Epstein has his El Zorro Ranch Corporation, New York Strategy Group, Ghislaine Corporation, J Epstein and Company and the Financial Strategy Group registered to this same address. Finally, a third call is received by at 12:02 pm from the same corporate number which lasts 12 minutes and 1 second. It should be noted that there is no further contact with either the victim during the month of March or April of 2006.
