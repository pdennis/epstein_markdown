Counsel of Record for Defendants may disclose Plaintiff’s identity only to Defendants and any attorneys, paralegals, and clerical or other assistants working with or for Defendants on matters related to this action; and the recipients of such information shall not disclose it to any other persons.

3. If Defendants wish to disclose Plaintiff’s identity to any person not otherwise permitted to receive such information under this Order, Defendants are limited to doing so in connection with defending this action, and must require such person to first execute a non-disclosure agreement, in a form agreed to by the parties, that prevents such person from disclosing Plaintiff’s identity to any other persons. Defendants must maintain a list of all such persons to whom Plaintiff’s identity is disclosed and copies of the executed non-disclosure agreements, all of which are subject to *in camera* inspection.

All portions of pleadings, motions or other papers filed with the Court that disclose Plaintiff’s identity shall be filed under seal with the Clerk of the Court and kept under seal until further order of the Court.
