# DEFENDANTS JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND SARAH KELLEN'S REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT

Pursuant to Rule 7.1(B)(1) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully request oral argument in connection with their motion to stay.

The defendants believe an opportunity to formally argue the motion would assist the Court in ruling on their motion, which seeks to stay this action until resolution of a pending criminal action.

The defendants estimate that the time required for argument is one hour.

The undersigned are authorized to represent that defendant Sarah Kellen joins in this request.
