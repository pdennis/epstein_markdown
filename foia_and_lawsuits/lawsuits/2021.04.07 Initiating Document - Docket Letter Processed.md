IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS
DIVISION OF ST. THOMAS/ST. JOHN

IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN,
Deceased

CASE NO: ST-2021-RV-00005
Originating Case No: ST-2019-PB-00080

Dear Carol Thomas-Jacobs, Esq.:

The Superior Court received the Notice of Appeal in the above-captioned case, which was docketed in the Appellate Division on March 17, 2021. The appeal is assigned to the Honorable Debra S. Watlington and is assigned a new case number: ST-2021-RV-00005. As the person who filed this appeal, it is your responsibility to follow the rules and procedures that apply to the Appellate Division, including the following:

The notice of appeal shall identify the party initiating the appeal, designate the decision or order appealed from, and contain a concise position statement of no more than 780 words in length (or three pages for self-represented parties) which sets forth the issues the party wishes to present for appeal, together with a brief argument in support of the party’s position. The notice must include a certificate evidencing service on all other parties to the Magistrate Division proceeding.

## Response:

Within fourteen (14) days of filing and service of the notice of appeal, any other party to the Magistrate Division proceeding may, but is not required, to file a response to the notice of appeal. The response may contain a concise position statement of no more than 780 words in length (or three pages for self-represented parties), which responds to the position statement in the notice of appeal, which may include designating additional issues of review.

## Judgment:

If the Magistrate Division issued a judgment awarding money or other relief (such as a writ of execution, restitution or a permanent restraining order) in a civil case or imposed a sentence (including fines and incarceration) in a criminal case, the judgment is NOT STAYED because a notice of appeal was filed. In civil cases, you must file a motion to request a stay pending appeal and/or post a bond.
