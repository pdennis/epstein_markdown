CASE NO.: 08-80804-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON

Pursuant to Rule 5.4 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen hereby move to file their motion for stay, as well as this motion, under seal, stating as follows:

1. In their motion for stay, defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen refer to a confidential agreement between the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein.

2. The information contained in the confidential agreement is material to this Court’s consideration of the defendants’ motion for stay.

3. To avoid disclosure of confidential material, the defendants request leave to file their motion for stay, and this motion, under seal.

4. We recognize that this Court has previously unsealed documents referring to this same agreement. We mean in no way to disregard that order, but seek merely to comply with the confidentiality clause in that agreement for this new and independent filing, in an abundance of caution, until directed otherwise by the Court.

5. The undersigned are authorized to represent that defendant Sarah Kellen joins in this motion.
