Re: Potential Claims against D.B. Zwirn

Dear Jeffrey:

I need you to come to New York City on December 3rd to meet with me and go to Davis Polk’s office to review some documents that they will only show us in their office. They claim they are subject to confidentiality agreements. This is necessary to help us evaluate the above claim.

Sincerely,

Stephen D. Susman
