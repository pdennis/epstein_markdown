on that, Your Honor?

THE COURT: It is going to be recorded.

MR. GOLDBERGER: That's fine.

THE COURT: Defendant needs to approach as well.

(Whereupon, there was a conference at the bench.)

MR. GOLDBERGER: The reason why I asked to come sidebar, there is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's office that triggers as a result of this plea agreement. In other words, they have signed off and said they will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for any offense upon his successful taking of this plea today. That is a confidential document that the parties have agreed to. Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted to tell the court.

THE COURT: I understand, that would also be invalidated should he violate his community control?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Absolutely. That

nonprosecution agreement --

MS. BELOHLAVEK: They spell all that out.

THE COURT: Mr. Epstein needs to come closer.

Mr. Epstein, your attorney has told me that in addition to everything, we talked about another Inducement, shall we say, to your taking this plea is that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement with you, meaning that if you successfully complete probation and do everything you're supposed to, they have, have agreed not to prosecute you federally, did you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am.

THE COURT: And I would view that as a significant inducement in accepting this plea.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: They are actually in court here today, also.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. GOLDBERGER: And the plea

agreement very carefully spelled out if
there was a breach that would violate this
agreement, so we are well aware of it.

THE COURT: Okay. I would request
that a sealed copy of that -- Mr. Epstein
has signed that document?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes, I would like to
seal the copy.

THE COURT: I want a sealed copy of
that filed in this case. That is the only
other condition of the agreement that is
influencing this defendant to make this
decision?

MR. GOLDBERGER: Absolutely. I think
that's the right idea.

(Return to open court.)

THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, is there
anything else?

THE DEFENDANT: No, ma'am.

THE COURT: Because I don't take
these pleas unless they are freely and
voluntarily made.

THE DEFENDANT: I understand that.

THE COURT: I also don't want
somebody or anybody coming back a year,
