# Status of Earlier Filed Case:

☐ Closed

(If so, set forth the procedure which resulted in closure, e.g., voluntary dismissal, settlement, court decision. Also, state whether there is an appeal pending.)

☑ Open

(If so, set forth procedural status and summarize any court rulings.)

On May 1, 2023, the Court entered an order granting in part and denying in part JP Morgan's motion to dismiss Doe's First Amended Complaint (Docket #130). The parties are proceeding with certain fact discovery, including the service of document subpoenas and certain depositions scheduled for May 2023.

Explain in detail the reasons for your position that the newly filed case is related to the earlier filed case.

The newly-filed litigation and earlier-filed litigation arise from a common nucleus of operative fact related to Epstein's longstanding history as a client of JP Morgan, and JP Morgan's concealment and/or failure to report Epstein's suspicious banking practices to regulators. The earlier-filed litigation asserts that JP Morgan facilitated, concealed, and/or enabled Epstein's abuse of dozens of victims, in violation of New York and federal law. The newly-filed litigation seeks to hold the board of directors liable for breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to properly oversee JP Morgan's relationship with Epstein and JP Morgan's compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations, and thereby allowing JP Morgan's misconduct related to Epstein to occur.
