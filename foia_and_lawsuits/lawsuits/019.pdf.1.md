Re: Davies v. Indyke et al., 19-cv-10788 (GRW) (DCL) DEBRA FREEMAN
UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE

Your Honor:

We represent Plaintiff Teala Davies, and write on behalf of all parties.

On January 21, 2020, Defendants submitted a pre-motion letter to Judge Woods proposing to file a motion to dismiss. (ECF 16). On January 22, Judge Woods issued an Amended Order Referring Case to Magistrate Judge clarifying that dispositive motions in this matter will be referred to Your Honor for Report &amp; Recommendation. (ECF 17). It is our understanding of Your Honor’s Individual Practices that no pre-motion letters are required for motions other than discovery motions, though Plaintiff’s counsel is of course happy/prepared to submit one should Your Honor prefer that.

Accordingly, we write 1) to seek clarification that Plaintiff need not submit a letter in response to Defendants’ January 21 pre-motion letter addressed to Judge Woods, and 2) to propose the following briefing schedule for Defendants’ motion:

- Defendants’ motion papers to be filed by February 25, 2020;
- Plaintiffs’ opposition papers to be filed by March 17, 2020;
- Defendants’ reply papers to be filed by March 31, 2020.

We appreciate Your Honor’s attention to this matter.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Mariann Meier Wang
