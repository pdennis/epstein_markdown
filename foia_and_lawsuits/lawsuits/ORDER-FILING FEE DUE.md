JEFFREY EPSTEIN vs. BRADLEY J. EDWARDS, ET AL.

Petitioner(s) Respondent(s)

The jurisdiction of this Court was invoked by the filing of a Notice to Invoke Discretionary Jurisdiction or Notice of Appeal in the lower tribunal; however, said notice was not accompanied by the $300.00 filing fee or an order of insolvency from the district court of appeal as required by Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure 9.110(b) and 9.120(b). The filing fee is due and payable at the time of filing the notice. Petitioner is allowed to and including January 11, 2016, in which to submit the filing fee, or an order of insolvency, or a proper motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis that complies with sections 57.081 and 57.082, Florida Statutes (2013). Failure to submit the filing fee or one of the above referenced documents to this Court could result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal of the notice.

Please understand that once this case is dismissed, it is not subject to reinstatement.
