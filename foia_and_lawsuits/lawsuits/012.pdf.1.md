### Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein’s Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to Quash and Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law

Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, (hereinafter “EPSTEIN”) by and through his undersigned attorneys, hereby files his Emergency Motion For Protective Order, Motion to Quash and Motion for Attorneys’ fees and Costs, With Incorporated Memorandum Of Law. In support, Defendant states as follows:

1. As this Court is well aware, these cases have been consolidated for discovery. However, on April 1, 2010, Plaintiff’s counsel, Spencer Kuvin, filed *C.L. v. Epstein*, Case No. 10-80447-cv-Marra/Johnson, and that case has not been consolidated with the other related cases for purposes of discovery.

2. On April 20, 2010, Mr. Kuvin served Maritza Milagros Vasquez with a subpoena for deposition, which is set to occur tomorrow. See Exhibit “A”. However, this Notice and subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed as Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 26 (d). That rule states, in pertinent part, that: “[a] party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f). . . .” Mr. Kuvin, on behalf of his client, has not complied with Rule 26(f) and, therefore, the subpoena for deposition must be stricken/quashed and a Protective Order should be entered pursuant to Rule 26(c) forbidding the deposition from

Case 9:10-cv-80447-KAM Document 12 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/14/2010 Page 2 of 9

occurring for non-compliance with the applicable rules. In *Varo, Inc. v. Litton Systems, Inc.*, 129 F.R.D. 139, 141 (N.D. TX 1989), the court held that one cannot be compelled to comply with a withdrawn subpoena. *Id.* Likewise, the court here cannot compel Maritza Milagros Vasquez to attend any deposition when the subpoena itself is invalid, especially when it will require those involved in these matters to incur substantial attorneys’ fees.

3. Next, Mr. Brad Edwards, counsel for Jane Doe, cross-noticed Maritza Milagros Vasquez’s deposition in Jane Doe (#08-80893 – Exhibit “B”), which matter is already set for trial in July 2010. Discovery concluded on May 31, 2010 (see DE 531). Accordingly, the cross notice served by Jane Doe must be stricken/quashed and a protective order entered because the subpoena itself is invalid due to C.L.’s counsel’s failure to comply with Rule 26(d) and discovery in Jane Doe (80893) has concluded.

## Rule 7.1 Certification

I hereby certify that counsel for the respective parties communicated by e-mail in a good faith effort to resolve the issues set forth above prior to the filing of this Motion and none of the issues were resolved.

WHEREFORE, Defendant requests that this Court enter an order granting Defendant’s motion for protective order and motion to quash. Defendant further requests that this Court award his attorney’s fees and costs associated with this motion, in accordance with Rule 37, Fed.R.Civ.P. and applicable Local Rules and specifically:

a. Quash CL’s subpoena attached as Exhibit “A”;
b. Quash and/or strike Jane Doe’s cross notice as to Exhibit “A” because Exhibit “A” is invalid and discovery has concluded in Jane Doe;
c. Award attorneys to Defendant for CL and Jane Doe’s noncompliance with these discovery matters; and
d. for such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.
