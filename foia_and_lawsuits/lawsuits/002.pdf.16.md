## MOTION TO KEEP TRUE NAME IN SEALED ENVELOPE

Plaintiff, L.M., moves this Court that, due to the sensitive nature of the matters contained in the accompanying Complaint, the true name affidavit of L.M., a pseudonym, presented to the Court concurrently with this Motion, be held by the Court in a sealed envelope to preserve the anonymity of Plaintiff, L.M., and that Plaintiff, L.M., be allowed to continue in this case under this pseudonym on the ground that revelation of Plaintiff, L.M.'s identity would cause severe personal, professional and economic consequences. Plaintiff, L.M., attaches in support of this motion a memorandum of law and an affidavit.

DATED July 24, 2009

Respectfully Submitted,
