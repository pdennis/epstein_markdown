|  Upon review of the response to this Court's order to show cause dated May 3, 2017, the Court has determined that it should decline to exercise jurisdiction in this case. See Debrincat v. Fischer, 42 Fla. L. Weekly S141 (Fla. Feb. 9, 2017). The petition for discretionary review is, therefore, denied.  |   |

LABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, LEWIS, POLSTON, and LAWSON, JJ., concur.
