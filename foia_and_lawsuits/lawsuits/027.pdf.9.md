**Re:** Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their capacities as the Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 1:20-cv-02365(LJL)(DCF)

Dear Judge Freeman:

I represent Jane Doe in the above referenced litigation. I write to respectfully request a one week extension to submit Plaintiff’s motion to proceed anonymously in the above referenced action. Defendant consents to this request.

For the past week I have been preparing and participating in an arbitration which has prevented me from focusing on other matters.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Respectfully submitted,
