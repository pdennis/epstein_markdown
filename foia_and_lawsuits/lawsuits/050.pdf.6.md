Case No. 502008CF009381AXXMB/502006CF009454AXXMB

1. The State of Florida charged the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, with Felony Solicitation of Prostitution.

2. The State of Florida and Mr. Epstein came to a negotiated resolution of the charges. Part of that resolution included an agreement entered into between Mr. Epstein and the United States. At the plea conference in State court Mr. Epstein plead guilty to the State charges. At the plea conference the agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States were made part of this Court’s record. The agreement was sealed in two separate filings. At the time the State court took these matters under seal, the proper procedure for sealing such documents had not been followed. The June 25th hearing was to give Mr. Epstein, the State, and/or the United States an opportunity to comply with the well-defined and narrow parameters for sealing such documents. After hearing argument of counsel, the Court makes the following findings and rulings:

1) Neither the State of Florida nor the U.S. Government nor Mr. Epstein have presented sufficient evidence to warrant the sealing of documents currently held by the Court.

2) The Motions to seal the Court records are denied.

3) The Motions to intervene are granted.

4) The Motion to unseal the documents is granted.

6) This Order is in no way to be interpreted as permission to not comply with U.S. District Court Kenneth Marra's previous Orders.

7) The disclosure of the sealed documents shall be stayed at least until June 26, 2009, at 9:00 a.m., at which time the Court will hear "Epstein's Motion to Stay Disclosure of Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum Pending Review".
