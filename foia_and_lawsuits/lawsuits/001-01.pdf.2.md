A. I was like saying, "Yeah, let's move on," because there was no point to asking that question.

Q. Your father threw out of the house because she was lying, correct?

MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Lack of foundation.

Hold on, Let me just make the objection.

Lack of foundation, predicate, calls for speculation.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. Answer.

A. I'm not my sister. I don't know.

Q. I want to know what you know only.

A. I don't know.

Q. You don't know. That's your answer?

A. Yes.

Q. Now your parents filed the police report regarding Mr. Epstein, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now your parents are also lying, aren't

they?

A. Yes.

MR. LEOPOLD: Just so the record is clear, the father -- because the mother was up north.

MR. TEIN: Don't testify, Counsel.

MR. LEOPOLD: So the record is clear, just the father. The mother was --

MR. TEIN: Counsel, don't coach and testify, please. That's absolutely improper.

MR. LEOPOLD: You just asked the wrong question.

MR. TEIN: You can't coach her that way and you well know it.

MR. LEOPOLD: For the record, it's the father. He's remarried, I think on his third marriage.

MR. TEIN: You cannot -- it's absolutely, totally against the rules and you know it.

MR. LEOPOLD: The natural mother lives in Georgia.

MR. TEIN: You need to behave yourself, lawyer.

MR. LEOPOLD: The natural mother lives in Georgia. The father is here locally.

You object. You know the rules. You just
lectured me about the rules, Counsel. So why
don't you play by the rules? Or only when they
fit you? Why don't you grandstand a little more
now. Give us a five-minute speech, Mr. Leopold.

MR. LEOPOLD: Are you finished, for the
record?

you want.

BY MR. TEIN:
Q. Your parents, who filed the police report
are also liars.

MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer the question.
We're not going to answer until I make the record.
I want to put on the record, now that Counsel
appears to be finished with his comments for the
record, that the previous question was
inappropriate, was intentionally misleading.
Now you can ask the question.

5   Q. Aren't your parents liars?

Don't look to your lawyer for the answer.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. TEIN:

Q. And your father filed a lawsuit, the first lawsuit for fifty million dollars against Mr. Epstein without consulting you, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And your father had a lawyer file the first lawsuit on your behalf for fifty million dollars against Mr. Epstein without your knowledge, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you don't trust your father, do you?

A. Correct.

Q. And you believe he's trying to manipulate you for his own gain, don't you?

A. Sort of.

Q. Well, you know that your mother filed a statement, an affidavit, saying that you don't trust your father and that you believe he's trying to manipulate you for his own gain; isn't that correct?

A. Correct.

5. A. I would like to clarify something. You keep saying my Epstein lawsuit money. I don't have any money, and it's just a lawsuit at the moment. So I just don't trust her.

Q. Are you saying you never kissed a man other than those two?

A. No.

Q. Ever in your life, have you exchanged sex for something of value?

A. No.

MR. TEIN: We're done.

THE WITNESS: Oh, okay.

MR. LEOPOLD: We'll read.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: I don't have any questions. Thank you.

MR. LEOPOLD: Before we go off the record, it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can correct the record -- but we have stipulated that color copies of the documents that were identified for identification certainly will be attached to the deposition and counsel will be taking the photographs across street so that they can be

laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the deposition.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Done.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. If not, then I want to pull each one out and put exhibit labels on them, which we should do before we leave.

MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do either. I'll have copies sent to the court reporter and she can attach them to the deposition.

MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree to what we talked about during the break then.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what your asking me to do. Let me finish.

MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies and then I'll give those to the court reporter, fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that process. I would send copies to the court reporter. But if it will make you happier --

and make a copy of those photos that were part of
this deposition and then I'll give them to the

MR. LEOPOLD: I trust you implicitly,
however you with to do it. However, the
documents, before they leave this room, need to
have an exhibit sticky on them with the
appropriate --

MR. GOLDBERGER: Want to go get some? We
don't have any.

MR. LEOPOLD: I will do that. Excuse me.
Let me finish the record, please. You can't do
that to the court reporter. She's going to stroke
out. You can't do that. You have to let me --

my life. Finish your sentence.

is it just going to be comma after comma after comma?

Go ahead, lawyer.

MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, I can't prevent you from taking them, but I will object and I will be bringing it to the court for sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of the room without them being marked. I want them marked, because you cannot identify in the record what was used. And with all due respect to Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this deposition is going, I do not want to rely on Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate exhibits. I will not do that. I cannot prevent you from taking them. But if you do, I will be bringing the matter to the court with appropriate sanctions, because that is improper. That is improper. When you use something in a deposition, they are to be marked. And you have refused to do that throughout for what ever reason.

MR. TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your sentence because you're talking about something you have no idea.

Every single one is marked, Ted. Every single one is already marked. But you want to

1. argue about everything. Ever single one is already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted?
2. MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this and I have never had an argument over this.
3. MR. TEIN: You've made -- Ted, you are obstructionist, you are a liar. You have lied and misrepresented things, for the record. You are grandstanding.

8. Let me say something else.
9. Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about the fact -- be quiet. Be quiet and let me finish. You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a complete and utter lie -- that you were unavailable this morning because you had a hearing. That was a lie. I have never seen a lawyer deign to do something like that.

MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --

MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, do you want to take care of this?

MR. TEIN: Let me finish my sentence. The exhibits are marked. We are walking out of here.

You are someone who misrepresents the record. It is absolutely atrocious what you do. That is not how a lawyer should behave. This deposition is over. You will get your exhibits, Mr. Leopold.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I understand what you're saying, Michael, and I understand Ted's position.

of issues in this case. We're going to have lots
of reasons to disagree.

I'm going to take it over now and I'm going
to make copies and I'm going to give them to
Ms. Consor. If you want to go find some exhibit
labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my
guest. But that's what I'm offering to do.

THE WITNESS: Let me say two things,
because I am happy to always disagree, and with
you, I have no problem; we could always do it
professionally. I have not problem.

I want to say two things so the record is
very clear.

Since for whatever reason I have not been
able to look at exhibits, because they have been
refused to have been shown to me --

MR. TEIN: That's a lie.

MR. LEOPOLD: -- Jack, if you represent
that the documents have the appropriate exhibit
numbers or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000,
whatever they may be, then you can take them, make
copies, send me a copy, make sure the court
reporter gets a copy and then send me a bill for
my copies, that's fine. I didn't know that they
are marked that way because I haven't been able to

look at them.

MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded, and the number that we've made reference to in the deposition coincides with the barcoding.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. Eight by eleven color laser copies are fine.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: The State Attorneys Office is not going to charge anybody for color copies I print out.

MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. He's going to take them back to his office.

Secondly -- and I will be more than happy to do it, because it sounds like you all know more about it than I -- but I'm happy to get affidavits from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about what happened with this hearing today, because I know very little about it. But my representations are what they are.

MR. GOLDBERGER: They stay --

MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just finish for the record.

My representations or comments about what happened, representation about this hearing this morning, I know very little about it. I --

that.

MR. LEOPOLD: No, no, no. I just put it on the record. I will get an affidavit -- I'm assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. Pincus. I have no clue about what happened and why it was canceled. All I was told when I was out of town yesterday was that the hearing this morning was cancelled.

MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word for it.

MR. LEOPOLD: If you want an affidavit, I'll get it for you.

MR. GOLDBERGER: It's a personal issue for me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it was done just because it wasn't convenient for you, then I'm offended by that. But if you're telling me that it was planned and it didn't happen, I'll take your word for it.

MR. LEOPOLD: I am more than happy to get you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm assuming since my deposition was taken for four hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am told it is being re-noticed.

MR. TEIN: I don't need it. But what I do take issue with is regardless of why it was canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, You know what? We can start earlier this morning.

MR. LEOPOLD: I owe you nothing.

MR. TEIN: I don't care. Don't interrupt me.

Because Jack canceled his vacation plans because of you.

MR. GOLDBERGER: That's all right, that's all right.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM Document 1-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008 Page 63 of 100
From: u .wn Page: 16/51 Date: 5/29/2008 12:09: M

7. This is an action for damages in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) exclusive of interest and costs.

8. Venue is proper in this Court under section 47.011, Florida Statutes, because the causes of action brought herein accrued in Palm Beach County, Florida and one or more Defendants resides in Palm Beach County, Florida.

## Factual Allegations

9. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein was an adult male. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to billionaires. He is a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, Florida. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach.

10. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for minor girls. He engaged in a plan, scheme, and/or enterprise in which he gained access to primarily economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls or coerced them to engage in prostitution, and then gave them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims.

11. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out this scheme/enterprise and assaulted girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas.

12. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Sarah Kellen, an assistant of Epstein's from New York, New York and Haley Robson, a Palm Beach Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. They recruited girls ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's plan/enterprise, Ms. Robson was contacted shortly before or soon after Epstein was at his Palm Beach residence. Epstein, Kellen or someone on their behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring one or more underage girls to the residence.

Case 9:08-cv-80804-KAM Document 1-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/21/2008 Page 64 of 100
From: ur    wn    Page: 17/51    Date: 5/29/2008 12:09:2    x

Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan/enterprise.

13. Epstein's plan, scheme, and/or enterprise reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation, touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator, or digitally penetrating the girl's vagina.

14. Consistent with the foregoing plan, scheme, and/or enterprise, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane Doe to Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. Ms. Kellen set up the message table and laid out message oils and told Jane Doe that Epstein would be in shortly and then left the room. Jane Doe was alone in the room when Epstein arrived. Epstein told her to remove her clothes and left the room. When Epstein returned he was wearing only a towel. He removed his towel, and laid down on his stomach on the message table. Epstein again told Jane Doe remove her clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane Doe complied, removing her clothes except for her panties and bra. Shortly

From: u.   wn   Page: 18/51   Date: 5/29/2008 12:09: M

after starting to rub Epstein's back, Epstein told Jane Doe to sit on his back. Jane Doe, out of fear and trepidation, complied. After a period of time Epstein got up from the table and went behind the door. For several minutes Jane Doe heard loud noises and moans and believes that Epstein was masturbating. Thereafter Epstein, naked, returned to the message table and laid face up on the table. Epstein then told Jane Doe to continue with the message and told her to sit on top of him. Out of fear and trepidation she complied. As Jane Doe rubbed Epstein's chest Epstein began to use a vibrator on Jane Doe's vagina. Thereafter Epstein began to digitally stimulate and attempt to penetrate Jane's vagina. At this same time Epstein was masturbating. Upon reaching orgasm Epstein got up from the message table and told Jane Doe to write down her name and phone number and then left the room.

15. Jane Doe was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs and into the kitchen. Epstein, Robson and Kellen were waiting for Jane Doe. Epstein paid Jane Doe $300. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane to him. Ms. Robson brought Jane Doe home.

16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane Doe experienced confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.

CIRCUIT CIVIL 4

## MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS

COMES NOW HALEY ROBSON, by and through her undersigned attorneys, and files this Motion to Quash Service of Process, and as grounds therefore would state as follows:

1. Florida Statute §48.031(1) allows service of original process by delivering a copy of it to the person to be served or by leaving copies at his or her usual place of abode with any person residing there who is fifteen years or older and informing that person of their contents.

2. An agent for counsel for the Plaintiff purports to have served HALEY ROBSON with a copy of the Complaint via residential substitution on March 21, 2008 at 8:34 p.m. (A true and correct copy of the Return of Service is attached

CASE NO. 50 2008 CA006596 XXXX MB

hereto as Exhibit A.) As the Court can see, the agent for the Plaintiff who served the Summons and Complaint purports to have served the same on Tommy Robson, who is identified as Haley Robson’s father. Said service was purportedly made at 12247 72nd Court North, Royal Palm Beach, Florida, located in Palm Beach County.

3. On March 21, 2008, Haley Robson’s usual place of abode was not 12247 72nd Court North, Royal Palm Beach, Florida, in Palm Beach County. Rather, Haley Robson’s usual place of abode on March 21, 2008, was an entirely different location. Haley Robson did not authorize anyone, including Tommy Robson, to accept service of process on her behalf. Therefore, this service was not proper and was ineffective.

4. It is well recognized in Florida that a person’s usual place of abode is defined as the place where the person is actually living at the time of service. See *Shurman v. Atlantic Mortgage and Investment Corp.*, 795 So. 2d 952 (Fla. 2001). In the *Shurman* opinion, the Supreme Court of Florida also confirmed that “statutes governing service of process are to be strictly construed and enforced.” *Id.* at 954.

5. There are different schools of thought as to the most appropriate way to challenge service of process. There is also some confusion with regard to whether filing a motion other than a Motion to Quash Service of Process waives one’s right

to move to quash service of process. Therefore, Haley Robson files this Motion to Quash Service of Process in lieu of any other type of motion or responsive pleading pursuant to the Fourth District Court of Appeal’s opinion in *Baraban v. Sussman*, which holds that the “preferable manner of presenting a defense of insufficiency of service of process . . .is by a Motion to Quash such allegedly insufficient service of process rather than by a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.” *Baraban v. Sussman*, 439 So. 2d 1046, 1047 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983).

6. Haley Robson reserves the right to supplement this motion with evidence to support it.

WHEREFORE, Haley Robson respectfully moves this Honorable Court for the entry of an Order granting Haley Robson’s Motion to Quash the Service of Process.

If you do not file your response on time, you may lose the case, and your wages, money, and property may thereafter be taken without further warning from the Court.
