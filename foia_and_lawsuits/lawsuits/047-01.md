NOLLE PROSEQUI
19 Cr. 490 (RMB)

1. The filing of this *nolle prosequi* will dispose of this case with respect to JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant.

2. On July 2, 2019, Indictment 19 Cr. 490 (the "Indictment") was returned, charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.

3. On or about August 10, 2019, while the above-captioned case was pending, but prior to any trial or other disposition, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died.

4. Because JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, died while this case was pending, and therefore before a final judgment was issued, the Indictment must be dismissed under the rule of abatement. See *United States v. Wright*, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1998).
