CASE #

YOU WILL BE ASKED TO LOOK AT A GROUP OF PHOTOGRAPHS. THE FACT THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE SHOWN TO YOU SHOULD NOT INFLUENCE YOUR JUDGEMENT. YOU SHOULD NOT CONCLUDE OR GUESS THAT THE PHOTOGRAPHS CONTAIN THE PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME. YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED TO IDENTIFY ANYONE. IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO FREE INNOCENT PERSONS FROM SUSPICION AS TO IDENTIFY GUILTY PARTIES. PLEASE DO NOT DISCUSS THE CASE WITH OTHER WITNESSES NOR INDICATE IN ANY WAY THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED SOMEONE.
