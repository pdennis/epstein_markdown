A Additional subpoenas that have been issued include OLY-28 to Colonial Bank, along with OLY-29, which was issued to Palm Beach National Bank &amp; Trust Company. That was served on March 5, 2007. It should be known that Palm Beach National Bank &amp; Trust Company is now operated by Colonial Bank, which we learned in the issuance process. We did receive documents back from Colonial Bank, which covered both subpoenas, on April 25, 2007.

Q And those sought information relating to bank accounts belonging to Mr. Epstein?

A That is correct.

Q What else?

A Also served OLY-30 to Western Union Financial Services seeking documents and records related to Jeffrey Epstein. It was served on February 26, 2007, and we received items back from Western Union on two separate dates, and two packages, the first on April 9, 2007, and the second on April 11, 2007.

Q And those sought records of wire transfers from Mr. Epstein to girls whom have been identified for this investigation?

A Yes.

Q What else?

A We also served OLY-31 to Western Union Financial Services. It was served on February 26, 2007, and they

returned information which we received on May 3, 2007.

Q The same type of information?

A Yes, the same type of information, seeking wire transfer information from Jeffrey Epstein to victims.

We also served OLY-32 to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. After serving that one on February 26, 2007, they informed us by letter that they are known as Chase, not J.P. Morgan Chase. So we had to reissue another subpoena, which was taken care of on March 22, '07.

We also issued OLY-40 on Chase Bank as well on April 4, 2007. We received records on April 13, 2007 and April 19, 2007 to cover all three subpoenas that were served.

Q And those sought information related to bank accounts and credit cards related to the defendants?

A Yes. Additionally, we served OLY-33 on Dr. Thomas Rofranno (phonetic), who's a chiropractic doctor. We were seeking records related to Jeffrey Epstein as a patient. The subpoena was served on March 6, 2007, and Thomas Rofranno provided materials on March 16, 2007.

Also we have OLY-36, which was served on the Palm Beach County Health Department. It was served on March 5, 2007, seeking birth certificates of our victims that we were researching. We received the records from the Palm Beach County Health Department on April 16, 2007.

We also served two subpoenas on the Adult Video Warehouse. The first one was OLY-41, which was served -- both of these were served on April 24, 2007, and they were seeking any transactions that had occurred on behalf of Mr. Epstein or those individuals that were working for him or with him. We received items back on the OLY-41 subpoena on April 30, 2007.

The second subpoena served on Adult Video Warehouse was OLY-34. Again, it was served on April 24, 2007, and the Adult Video Warehouse complied and provided us materials on April 30, 2007.

That concludes all of the items that we have received to date for the outstanding subpoenas that were issued.

Q Are the documents that you refer to in that box that's on the desk?

A Yes, they are.

: Does anyone want to review those documents? At this time, no one is requesting that they want to review the documents today.

Would you please swear in the witness to maintain those documents.

(Witness sworn in as custodian of the records.)

(Witness excused.)
