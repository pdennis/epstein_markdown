to Mr. Epstein.

A. Yes.

Q. And you said that they made a proposition to you. What was that exactly?

A. [redacted] had asked me if I wanted to make money and she was working for this guy, Epstein, in Palm Beach.

previously worked for Epstein or was currently working for Epstein?
A Yes, that's right.
Q So they explained this proposal to you and you said that you would be interested?
A Yes.
Q What happened next?
A Within a couple of days to a week I picked them up and I went to his house to work for him and I was introduced to , who is his assistant. She took me upstairs to Epstein's bedroom and that's where the massage took place. I was naked and he tried fondling me and I wouldn't have it, so after the massage he gave me another proposition to bring girls to the house and for every girl that I brought I would make $200.
Q All right. We'll go back over that a little more slowly. I know this is a lot of information. So let's go back to the proposition that and made to you. Did they say you would be paid for massaging Mr. Epstein?
A Yes.

A $200.

Q Now you said that they had told you that you might have to take your clothing off?

A They told me that I was expected to take my clothing off and that there would be fondling.

Q Okay. And what -- did they explain what fondling meant?

A Just that he'd be touching me.

Q Okay. And so you agreed to do that and you went to Mr. Epstein's home?

tell you anything about what you would do when you got upstairs?

A No, she never discussed that with me.

Q Did she say anything to you about taking your clothes off?

A No, she never discussed that with me.

Q Okay. When you arrived upstairs, you said that you went into a bedroom?

A That is correct.

Q What was in the bedroom?

A It was a bedroom that had a door that led to then I want to say a bigger more than just a bathroom. It was a bigger room with like a pretty large size walk-in closet, a shower, a steam shower, and then two sinks on the right, and in the middle laid the massage table, and then to the left there was two couches.

Q And so the massage table was already set up when you arrived?

A That is correct.

Q Okay. And after led you up to the bedroom, what did she do?

what was he wearing?

A He was wearing a towel.

Q Okay. And nothing else?

A Nothing else.

Q And what did he do?

A He laid on the table and that's when the
massage began and later on he -- when he got in, I
took off my clothes and I was just wearing my
bottoms, and he later tried to touch me and he
grabbed my butt, and that's when I had a problem.
I told him that I didn't feel comfortable.

So later he took the towel off and he
was laying on his back and he
asking me to
and then after that everything
was done.

Q Okay. So when Mr. Epstein
then the massage or whatever was over?

A Yes, it was.

Q And once that happened, what did he do?

A Just got up and dried himself off and
then walked me downstairs.

Q And you got dressed as well?

happened?

A I went back into the kitchen and he pulled [redacted] and [redacted] aside and then we just left. Of course, I got paid.

Q Okay. And tell us where you got paid, who paid you, and how much you received?

A Epstein paid me. I received 200, but I cannot recall if it was upstairs that he paid me or if he waited until I got back downstairs.

Q Okay. And when he paid you the $200, was it in small bills, large bills?

A Big bills, 100s.

Q Okay. So two 100 dollar bills. And you said that he pulled [redacted] and [redacted] aside. Do you know what that was about?

A He would never pay them in front of me. He always was funny about that. So I'm sure it was just paying them for bringing me.

Q Okay. And you mentioned that you told Mr. Epstein that you were uncomfortable with him touching you?

A That's correct.

Q And what became of that?

A Later on before I left he had addressed me to not massage him anymore, but asked me if I

could bring girls over and for every girl that I brought to the table he would pay me $200.

Q Okay. So you weren't comfortable with him touching you, so you weren't going to do any more massages?

A No.

Q He wanted you to find other girls?

A That's correct.

Q And he wanted girls that would let him touch them?

A Uh-huh.

Q After that first massage, did you perform any other massages at his house?

A Absolutely not..

Q Did you bring girls?

A That's correct.

Q Tell us how you started to bring girls to Mr. Epstein's house.

A Just girls that I met in high school, acquaintances, people that I just said hi and bye to. A lot of them actually heard about it through a couple of girls that I brought and they were interested.

Some of the girls asked me about it. Just girls in school I'd talk to, just get on the

subject. They had no problem with it.

Q Okay. So when you found a girl that you thought would be interested, what exactly would you tell her?

A I asked them if they were interested in making extra money and that I knew an older wealthier man in Palm Beach who liked to have massages and they would get paid $200.

The more they did, the more they make, and I would explain to them in detail what was expected of them when they showed up at the house and I also told them that if they are under age just lie about it and tell him that you are 18.

Q Let's talk first about what you said that you tell them what was expected of them.

A Yes.

Q First of all, why did you tell them that?

A Because that's what I was told.

Q By whom?

A [redacted] and [redacted].

Q Okay. And did Jeffrey Epstein ever address you about don't bring girls over here if they don't know what's going to happen?

Q Okay. So all the girls were supposed to know that when they got there they would be undressing?

A They would be undressing. There would be touching. There would be fondling. He was very big on that. He told me never to bring a girl over unless they knew what was expected.

Q Okay. And did you also tell them that he would [redacted]?

A I didn't really talk to them about that. I didn't know if he did it with everybody or it was just with me that he did that.

Q But you told them that they all would have to be partially naked or fully naked?

A Partially to fully naked and there would be touching and fondling.

Q Okay. How many girls do you think you took to Mr. Epstein's house?

A There were a few girls he wasn't crazy about. He didn't really like. He didn't favor. , for instance, 23, he thought she was kind of too old.

Q Okay. So you brought a girl named , who was 23 years old?

A Yes.

Q And you were told that she was too old?

A Yes.

Q Did you ever bring her back?

I told her in detail what was expected and she, to me, was all for it and then when she got there, decided she didn't want to perform what was necessary. So they got and after that I never really brought her back.

or [redacted] say anything to you about what happened with [redacted]?

A He had made a comment just about -- I had asked -- he had asked me for someone to come over and work and when I suggested [redacted], he kind of nodded, not really interested. He told me to find somebody else. So I assumed that meant he really didn't care for her.

Q Okay. Now the -- you mentioned [redacted], who was 23. What was the age range of the other girls that you brought to Mr. Epstein's home?

A High school, 16 to 18.

17

1 jury what those two ways are?
2 A The more you did is the more you make.
3 Basically, the more clothes that come off, the
4 more you let him touch you, the more you just let
5 him have his way with you is the more that you
6 would make, otherwise, you would be demoted down
7 to bringing girls over and just making money that
8 way.
9 Q And that's what you were doing?
10 A That's correct.
11 Q Was bringing girls?
12 A That's correct.
13 Q If you could explain to the grand jury
14 how you would go about making an appointment for a
15 girl to come and give a massage?
16 A His assistant there would call me either
17 before they got into town or while he was in town
18 and either she would ask me for a particular girl,
19 preferably one that he favored, or if I couldn't
20 get a hold of that girl just bring somebody over
21 to work.
22 I would call the girl. She would okay
23 it. I would call back, confirm it, set an
24 appointment, and then the next couple of days we'd
25 go.

Q Did she give you any reason why he really liked this girl or just is this girl available? What would happen on those calls?

A If it was a specific girl, she would call me and just ask: Can this girl work? She would never give me a reason. She would never go into detail. It was just: Can she work, yes or no?

Q And [REDACTED] was saying to you can she work?

A I can't recall if those were her exact words. I can't remember if it was: Can she come

Q Okay. Now when you would bring a new girl over to the house, what would you do?

A Walk up the same way towards the back of the house. They would let us in. I could sit in the kitchen with the girl. I would either wait for [redacted] to come in or Jeffrey. Most of the time it was [redacted].

[redacted] would bring the girl upstairs while I waited downstairs. After the massage, the girl would come downstairs. I would get paid and then we would leave.

Q Tell us how you would get paid when you were the person who brought the girls.

A What do you mean how I would get paid?

Q Who would pay you?

A Jeffrey Epstein would pull me aside whether it be in his, I guess, living room slash office. He would just make sure that when he paid me, it was just me and him, nobody else was around.

Q And how much would you get paid for each girl?

A $200.

Q And again with the two 100 dollar bills?

Q Now you mentioned that usually [redacted] would take the girl upstairs?

A That's correct.

Q Were there ever instances where you took the girl upstairs?

message table was.

I would set it up for them. I would show them where the towels were, put the towels on the massage table and then I would tell them Jeffrey would be in, in a minute and then I would walk back downstairs and wait in the kitchen.

Q Okay. And when you were in these other instances where you led the girl upstairs, besides the massage table, did you ever see any other implements that were used during the massage?

A Who first asked me to first other girls?

Q Yes.

A That would be Epstein.

A Yes.

Q Okay. And then the other question was: Are you currently in contact with anyone who works for Mr. Epstein or himself?

A I don't talk to any of the females that I once brought over there. I haven't been in contact with Epstein for years. He tried contacting me a few times. I haven't contacted him back. I refuse

to talk to him. I refuse to talk to any of the girls that were involved. However, I did live with one of the girls in Orlando for a couple months to a year. I haven't spoken to her in over a year either.

A That's correct.

Q So since then --

A I don't -- to be honest with you, I think it was more 2003, 2004.

Q Okay.

A My junior senior year.

Q Okay. But anyhow it was a couple of years ago?

A Several years ago.

Q Okay.

: Is there any follow up on either of those points? Yes,

A GRAND JUROR: Was it Jeffrey Epstein himself trying to contact you or ?

THE WITNESS: I don't know if it was him directly. I know that his number showed up

on my house phone. I'm assuming because
[REDACTED] was there, I'm assuming that she is the

Okay. Thank you, [REDACTED]. Thank you for
coming.
