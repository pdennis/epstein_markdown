# epstein_markdown

This repository contains markdown conversions of government-released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein from various sources.

## About

All documents have been processed through Mistral OCR, which is (in my testing) currently the best document-aware processing system available. The OCR is context-aware and can recognize redactions and other document features, providing a more easily parsable unstructured dataset than the traditional OCR that shipped with the government's released documents.

## Sources

- U.S. Department of Justice document library
- FBI document library

## Notes

- **Text only**: Images are not preserved in this conversion process
- **Filenames unchanged**: Original filenames from the source releases are maintained
- **Last updated**: December 23, 2025

## Purpose

These markdown files provide a cleaner, more accessible format for researchers and analysts working with this document set.
