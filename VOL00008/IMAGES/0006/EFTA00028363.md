Dear Judge Pitman,

With apologies for being in touch over the weekend, we wanted to write to advise you regarding our expected application tomorrow morning to unseal Indictment 19 Cr. 490, United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, and to have a district judge assigned to the case (from Wheel C). Attached is an electronic copy of the application and proposed order we expect to formally submit first thing tomorrow morning, in case that is useful for the Court to have in advance.

We believe that Judge Moses may have advised you that this presentment might occur on Monday, but we also wanted to be in touch directly, particularly because we expect there may be significant press and public attention and attendance at a proceeding before your honor, if the district judge refers presentment.

If you would prefer that we schedule an early-morning time tomorrow to come to court to submit the application and effect a wheel-out, we would be happy to be available as early as is practicable for the Court, or otherwise we will call chambers in the morning for guidance on what the Court prefers. And I am available for any questions anytime in the interim, or tomorrow, via phone at [redacted]. Thank you.

Respectfully,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
