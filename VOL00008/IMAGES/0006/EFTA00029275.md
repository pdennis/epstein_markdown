Sorry, I just realized I mixed up [redacted] and [redacted]. All three witnesses have not met with us but [redacted] has indicated she won't come in, right?

Is the following fair/accurate? If there are specific concerns they raised, feel free to add/edit as appropriate. Thanks

Following [redacted] comments about Prince Andrew on January 27, the team heard from counsel for several witnesses who had seen [redacted] remarks and had concerns. Specifically, the team heard from counsel for [redacted] and [redacted], each of whom referenced [redacted] comments about Prince Andrew and sought to confirm that their own communications with the team about their clients would remain confidential. [redacted], as you know, has already met with us several times. [redacted] and [redacted] – both of whom are believed to have worked in some capacity for Maxwell/Epstein during relevant time periods – have never been interviewed before but have expressed a willingness to come in, and we have been working with their counsel now to arrange for interviews.

Subject: RE: attorneys asking about confidentiality

Following up on our discussion earlier, the attorneys who have asked about confidentiality since the public comments about Prince Andrew include counsel for [redacted], counsel for [redacted], and counsel for [redacted].

Separately, just a reminder to please send us [redacted] email on the Maxwell depositions? We're going through them separately as well, but would be helpful to know what jumped out to him in his read.

thanks,

[redacted]
