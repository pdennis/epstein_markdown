Thanks __________. Attached is the updated version. I'm sorry but I could only update the hearing information. The other edits can't be done due to the template in VNS which can't be changed. Frustrating I know, but I did my best to make it look decent. Let me know if I can send it out. Thanks and sorry again!

Hi _______________.

Thanks. A few things:

EFTA00029515

- In the case caption, please delete “defendant(s),” so that it does not read “defendant(s) Jeffrey Epstein”. I’m not sure if that’s the form language, but it looks like a typo.
- Regarding the hearing information, there are several other court dates. I’ll forward you the scheduling order so that you can add them.
- Please swap out this language:

Because of the Court’s schedule, hearing dates could change on very short notice. If you plan on attending, you may want to call the VNS Call Center or check the website to confirm the date and time. Please note, there is a 24-hour delay in information transfer to the website.

And replace it with this language:

If you plan on attending, please call me at [redacted] in case there are any last minute changes.

Thanks!
