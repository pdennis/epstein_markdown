I'm wide open Wednesday if there is a time that day when a call would work on your end. I have been waiting for the information you request from the FBI, and I will urge the case agents to get me this information in time for a Wednesday call.

Thank you,

I hope you're well. Could we set up a call maybe on Monday or Tuesday, depending on your/Gloria's availability to hear anything at all on the two requests below, especially more info on the photos? We had been holding off on sharing this potentially difficult-to-hear news with our clients till we had more info from you, but really need to inform them soon.

Thank you,
Mariann

Hi Mariann,

I apologize for the delayed response regarding your other questions. I've been waiting for the case agents to provide me with the answers, but they have been swamped and have not had the chance to get back to me on this. They are traveling for work this week, but I will check back in with them on this when they return.

Best,

Thanks to you and your team for your sensitivity and support in hearing our clients on Friday. They all very much appreciated it.

May I just check in about the other two items below to see when you might have an update. Re the photograph info especially, we don't want to convey the info to our clients until we understand the scope/clarifications.

Thank you,
Mariann
