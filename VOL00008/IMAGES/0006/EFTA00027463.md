Anything that might be outside of sentry, like pen data?

I've never seen it. We did ask about 302s, but this is a good reason to re-ask and request the full sentry file (which we didn't do previously unless I'm forgetting).

I agree on both points. Did we initially ask FBI for their entire SENTRY file? I think we may want to do that to be safe.

See attached - I think we need to ask [REDACTED] what Lt. [REDACTED] reviewed to get this information.

Also, I don't think I've seen this 302 before. [REDACTED], I thought we had asked FBI for all 302s, but I could be misremembering. Either way, I think we should do so again.

Hey [REDACTED] ---

When looking through my case file, this is where [REDACTED] documented the phone number and last call made by Epstein. Let me know if you need anything else...
