All,

Thanks for the call this afternoon, it was helpful to work through the mechanics of filing reductions this afternoon. As we discussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with reductions applied: (1) the Government's motion in limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply.

Please let us know if you would like us to add any reductions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to Exhibits:

- We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A.
- Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without reductions.
- All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal.

Best,
