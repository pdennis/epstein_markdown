We heard second-hand from a colleague that our civil division is processing a FOIA request relating to the Epstein investigation (but unclear on specifics). Obviously this is the first we’ve heard of it, and understandable that there wouldn’t be cross-communication since the criminal investigation is still covert (and not widely known even among assistants), but it still is a little puzzling in terms of why such a review would be venued here. Do you who the right person would be in civil to ask about FOIA processes there? We’re happy to reach out if that’s appropriate, or if you prefer to do it at the supervisor level certainly no objection from us.
