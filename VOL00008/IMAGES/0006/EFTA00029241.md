Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

Enclosed with this cover letter is a form requesting permission for defense counsel to bring their personal electronic devices and computing devices to in-person court appearances in the above-captioned case. We respectfully request that the Court grant wi-fi access and so order the form.

In addition, the parties have arranged for an evidence view to take place, with the defendant present, at 500 Pearl Street the weeks of April 12-16, 2021 and April 19-23, 2021. Because much of the evidence is in electronic format, defense counsel will need to bring into the courthouse the following equipment to view and photograph the evidence:

1. VCR player
2. Cassette player
3. CD player
4. Adapter for a micro-VHS tape
5. Microcassette player
6. Digital camera

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Court grant defense counsel permission to bring these items, as well as their personal electronic devices, into the courthouse for the weeks of April 12-16, 2021 and April 19-23, 2021.
