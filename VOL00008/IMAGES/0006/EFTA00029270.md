Hi

Thanks, that looks right to us. Our team isn't sure how to respond to these requests, and now that we have slightly more bandwidth than we did last month, we were hoping to discuss how to approach this. A call with [redacted] would probably be helpful to sort out how we should proceed here-- I'll send an email momentarily to schedule a call.

Thanks very much,

Hi

Per our call, please find attached the requests from [redacted] including names in footnotes, as well as the Masseuse list document that I was looking at. I'm probably missing something, but I don't see the names on the list (with the exception of [redacted]) but the last name on the list doesn't match the requester's or is not included).

Thanks,
