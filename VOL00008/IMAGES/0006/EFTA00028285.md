That's very funny. Wires must have crossed, because we had given them people to contact (who aren't you!). I'll handle it.

Mr. Berman,

Hope you are well. As referenced below, I'm working with investigators on this matter. I would love to speak with someone in your office so that they can be aware of what we are looking at, and vice versa. Would you mind letting me know who in SDNY I should contact? Thank you so much,

Assistant United States Attorney

[REDACTED], thanks for the heads up. We are looking into aspects of the estate. I would like to put our unit chiefs in contact with someone in your office in charge of the matter to coordinate. Who would you suggest? Best, Geoff

Good afternoon and greetings from the USVI:

We are opening an investigation of the Jeffrey Epstein estate and Southern Country International Bank in the USVI. The investigation will be worked by FBI and IRS-CI. I wanted to reach out to you, in order to make certain that we are not interfering with any ongoing investigation that your office may have.

I am happy to discuss.

Best wishes,
