Subject: Cooperator info re Epstein

Date: Sat, 24 Aug 2019 01:12:50 +0000

Hi [redacted] and [redacted],

I just spoke with [redacted], who got a call from an aspiring cooperator [redacted] named [redacted], who's a [redacted] reported that another [redacted] as "[redacted]"—gave him information relating to Epstein. For several months, [redacted] has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and third-hand information that's not actionable unless another inmate also cooperates. We can also talk in person next week about the relative quality of his information.

I leave it to you guys to follow up with [redacted] as you see fit. I'm sure someone on this email can make [redacted] available to you, if you want, once you get a sense of what he's about. I just don't want to unilaterally sit on this.

Have a nice weekend!
