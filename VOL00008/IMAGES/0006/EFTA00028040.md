Subject: inquiry from Daily News for upcoming Epstein story

Date: Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:16:13 +0000

Stephen Brown is working on a story about the ongoing investigation into possible co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein. The story will probably appear in Monday's editions of the News. He's seeking (but not expecting, necessarily) guidance on the following:

- The investigation is looking into Ghislaine Maxwell and [redacted]
- Did massage recipients know the girls giving the massages were underage?
- Re Epstein's girlfriend [redacted], is she viewed as a victim?
