Hi

Today our office is sending via FedEx a new drive containing additional discovery for Ghislaine Maxwell. For your reference, attached are the cover letters. Would you (or someone at the MDC) please keep an eye out for this and make sure it gets to Maxwell as soon as it arrives? Her attorneys have been complaining about delays between when we send the drives and when they get to Maxwell.

Thanks so much, as always, for all of your help.
