Perfect, thanks. I deleted my duplicative copy. I'll create a case file for additional records.

Hey I'm sorry, I should have been more clear – I already saved the contents here –

I just wanted to give you the disc for a case file for physical records. Sorry again! And yeah, if you could please retain the hard copy that would be great. Many thanks.

I placed the materials on the disc you left on my desk here.

I believe this is where it belongs, but let me know if you'd like the folder renamed/moved elsewhere. Should I create a case file for this case and keep physical records or would you like the disc back?

Best,
