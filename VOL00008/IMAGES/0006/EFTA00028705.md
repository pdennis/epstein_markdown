Subject: Re: order of proof meeting

Great. and I are doing a brown bag for the summer interns until 1:30 on the 14th, but we should be free that afternoon. I'm also free the morning of the 15th. If possible and assuming you're all comfortable with it, could we meet in person?

Following up on our conversation this morning, the team is free for an order of proof meeting during the following windows:

- Anytime after 12 p.m. on June 14th
- Anytime before 12 p.m. June 15th

We chatted as a team, and we're going to be working on the RTC and a Daubert motion over the summer, as we discussed. Time permitting, we're likely going to work ahead on a 404(b) motion as well.
