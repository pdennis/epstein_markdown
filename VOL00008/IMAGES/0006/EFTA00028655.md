Okay, thanks for informing me ☐. I’ll know for the future if this situation arises again.

☐, as per the attached email from ☐, unfortunately the Government won’t be able to refund the cancellation fee.

Good morning all,

☐ clarified that the San Francisco trip below was actually a personal trip. He is asking about receiving a credit card refund for cancelling his San Francisco trip due to a work-related business trip occurring the same day. Would he be able to receive reimbursement for the $100 cancellation fee he received?

EFTA00028655

If possible, would I need to fill out a SF-1164 to process his reimbursement, or is there another form I would need to fill out? Any info on how to proceed is appreciated. Thanks as always!

Just a quick question regarding the cancelled trip for this Thursday (5/30/19). Was this trip booked through CWT by phone or online? If either scenario, I'll need the cancelled record locator to see if it's refundable, and ask them to send me a document stating it was refunded to your government travel card. Thanks.

Hi

I have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this weekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate the reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different reservations—I'm sorry about that!).

Because I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, approved my second leg flight to go straight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are:

Tuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI
- JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.)

Tuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach
- Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30

Thursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL)
- Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m.

If these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day before to at least make the reservations.

Last question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because there were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back

EFTA00028656

to New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that?

Please let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always.

-- I have previously-scheduled travel to San Francisco next Thursday for a wedding, and the way our victims have asked to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to end on Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just book the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 a.m. flight but that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any inconvenience but wanted to check – thank you!

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

EFTA00028657

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
