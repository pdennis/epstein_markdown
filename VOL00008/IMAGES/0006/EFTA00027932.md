Good afternoon ☐

I hope all is well. I understand the prosecution team has been walled off from the investigation. Do you have access to his records from his prior incarceration? If not, do you have a contact for his prior facility or the USAO in Florida? I have been asked to track down certain documentation in reference thereto in relation to the various investigations into the incident this past weekend.

Thank you,
