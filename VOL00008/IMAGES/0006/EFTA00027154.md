Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)

Dear Judge Berman:

As the Court is aware, on about the morning of August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August [ ], the Office of the New York City Medical Examiner issued its report concluding that the defendant’s cause of death was suicide. In light of the death of the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government must request the Court approve the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi.

Consistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached order, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing its utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many others who have yet to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
