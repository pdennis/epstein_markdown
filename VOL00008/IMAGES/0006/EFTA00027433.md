Thanks very much, ☐! This all looks right to me and makes sense. If we are pushing this past Monday, I'd ask that it be Wednesday afternoon, or anytime Thursday, please. I've got a lengthy grand jury presentation to make on Tuesday.

Team,

In preparation for our call (which we can reschedule to a time following the discovery deadline), I wanted to send around a list of topics to discuss for potential next steps. I'm sure I've missed some items, but this is a starting point at a least.

For context, I think we currently expect to call at least the following witnesses at trial:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

- *Records custodian from Interlochen
- *Records custodian from the Professional Children's School
- *Court reporter(s) from GM depositions

*We haven't identified/spoken to these witnesses yet, so that's on the trial prep to-do list as well.

The following are some potential next steps – either individuals to interview or re-interview, records to search for/identify, and so forth.

- Relativity review of GM emails
- Identify an Interlochen employee (likely retired) who managed donor relations with Epstein/can authenticate documents
- Identify a PBPD detective who can authenticate items recovered from search of PB house
- Talk to ☐ to make sure ☐ has searched all her emails for relevant communications
- Potentially interview ☐ client
- Potentially re-interview ☐
- Meet with ☐
- Interview ☐
- Interview ☐
- Interview Jo Jo Fontanella
- Re-interview ☐
