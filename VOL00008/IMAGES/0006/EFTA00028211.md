Here are one or two very small things. This looks great to me, and I defer to you guys on the bigger picture stuff, since you're closer to the facts and the law here. Thanks so much for everyone's excellent work on this—really impressive stuff.

Hi all,

Here's a version that incorporates the Loftus section. The plan is to have a draft in the chiefs' inbox when they wake up, so if folks are still up, would love comments as you can.

I'm going to write the Rocchio section now, so that will come later...

Thanks,

Hi team,

In the interest of expediency, here is the Daubert motion for your comments. I still need to write my section, and I'm doing some significant revisions to the Loftus section, but the Dietz section is done — crushed it. That's the bulk of the motion, so feel free to read that over, and I'll send you the rest in a second round later.

Thanks,
