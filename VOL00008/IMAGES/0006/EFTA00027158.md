Subject: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Date: Wed, 21 Apr 2021 19:13:39 +0000

Dear Judge Nathan,

The Government writes in response to the Court's April 19, 2021 scheduling Order, which directed the Government to inform the Court by email regarding victim attendance at the upcoming arraignment in this matter.

The Government has conferred with the attorneys who represent all four victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment, and reports the following:

- Victim-1, Victim-3, Victim-4, and their respective counsel will not be attending the conference.
- Victim-2 plans to attend the conference by phone. Her counsel have asked whether she should dial into the public access line, or whether the Court will provide a separate access line for victims.
- Victim-2's attorneys, David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, plan to attend the conference in person.

Respectfully,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
One Saint Andrew's Plaza
New York, NY 10007
