Hi

I just spoke with [redacted], who approved the use of USAO funds to pay for an Epstein victim named [redacted] to fly from Palm Beach to New York tomorrow 9/12 so that she can meet with us. She will be meeting with the Epstein team of AUSAs and agents at 5pm tomorrow evening, and then will need to stay over in a hotel tomorrow night, flying back to Palm Beach on Friday 9/13.

Would you please book her travel? Info is below:

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Thanks so much,
