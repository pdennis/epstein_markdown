The most recent one I have is for Maxwell, attached – you may want to just check the forms library to see if there has been any update since this version (2019.07.24), but I assume it's up to date since it's just from the summer.

From a little further back, but possibly simpler, also attached is one I got for a PAC case to make arrests.

Good luck!!
