As discussed, please feel free to have [redacted] call me to discuss what briefing materials he needs.

It is our preference that you guys, where possible, not draft briefing materials yourselves.

Attached is the latest draft of the timeline we put together, which gives an overview of the relevant events.

I am also attaching a timeline we put together of the video review and internet search history. [redacted], it would be very helpful to fill in as much detail as possible on the video review including what direction they are walking (using the maps). If you want to write the notes out we can add them into the spreadsheet. [redacted] will be in all weekend so feel free to give us a call with any questions.

There's a lot of information in this case and I think we are all getting swamped. I know we are trying to review and retain all the info while also doing the enforcement and investigative steps. Our boss said you guys did a pretty comprehensive power point? Would you guys mind providing that or anything you guys prepared to keep track of the case, I know it would help me out a little, I feel like I'm drowning in information. Apologies.
