Pleasure talking with you on Friday.

As [redacted] had mentioned, she very much wants to get a copy of the pictures that [redacted] had taken.

If you find them, please forward a copy to us so we can give to her. This is something she has been asking me to get for years, but I could never find.

To assist you with identifying [redacted], as she is now over a decade older, I am enclosing two pictures of [redacted] I had from 2008 or 2009, that were closer to the time the Epstein pictures were taken.

You are authorized to provide the pictures I am sending you to [redacted] and [redacted].

Thanks for your help.
