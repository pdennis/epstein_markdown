Hi [redacted],

Certainly, will do. Are these the final versions, or is it possible that any changes will be made today or tomorrow?

Thanks,

Hello—

I have made the changes to the Focus Group Questionnaire that you requested.

The Jury Instructions are ready to print. Please bring 40 copies (stapled upper left) with you to the focus group on Saturday.

The Verdict Questions are printed at the end of the questionnaire. The facilitators orally encourage the juries to reach a unanimous verdict, but ultimately each juror marks their own verdict sheet with their own individual vote. If the verdict is not unanimous, we see which jurors voted for the defense, and during the debrief after the deliberations on each count we find out why they voted the way they did.

Will you be bringing binders with copies of documents for jurors to refer to?
