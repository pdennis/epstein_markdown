I am a retired Police Detective with over 25 years service in the investigation into child abuse. I was threatened and bullied out of my job for exposing the high-level cover-up of child prostitution. For the past eight years, I have been working with anti-child abuse campaigner Bill Maloney in raising awareness of the true extent of the scale of this heinous crime. I, now with other whistleblowing cops as well as victims and survivors of abuse, am campaigning for a change in the Law to give brave whistleblowers the protection they truly deserve. In the words of Edmund Burke: "All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."

Since I stood up and exposed the vile crimes against children (which were suppressed for decades), I faced a sustained and aggressive onslaught designed not just to silence me but to ultimately destroy me.

This attack strengthened my resolve, and I embarked on a journey where I have met brave, kind, compassionate individuals comprised of fellow whistleblowers, victims, and survivors of abuse. If whistleblowers do not receive adequate, independent, and secure protection then the horrific abuse of society's most vulnerable and precious members will continue.

I graciously and respectfully ask that you back my campaign. Thank you to everyone who have already generously donated. Please continue supporting justice by donating to our ongoing cause.
