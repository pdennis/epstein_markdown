Good morning-
I am on the VTC with Ms. Maxwell who has confirmed that she has not received the hard drive
sent by the government and delivered to the MDC on Tuesday.
Further, there is legal material and books that have been delivered to the MDC and have not been given to Ms. Maxwell.
Please provide an explanation immediately.
Thank you.
Bobbi
