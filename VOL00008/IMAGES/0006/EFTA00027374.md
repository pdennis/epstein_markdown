Good Afternoon Mr. [REDACTED] &amp; Ms. [REDACTED]

We have never spoke directly. I have been told by my attorney I can speak to you since you are consider law enforcement. You emailed my attorney Mr. Robert Lewis. I am writing you to please do not under estimate Mr. Epstein's ability to leave the country as he is asking for bail. Mr. Epstein has an apartment in Paris and he has friends that have the private means of getting him out of the country. I am not saying this is going to happen, but I know first hand that Mr. Epstein is like a family member to my former employer. He is the godfather to their children and they will help him and vice versa. They call him uncle "F." Since this situation is now extreme there is no telling how much pressure Mr. Epstein might put on them to help him. As they say, "they do favors for each other," and this goes as far as giving each other money when needed as well as the use of their private planes and cars.
