Good morning,

The above-captioned case was wheeled out to Judge Nathan this morning. Attached please find the indictment.

The defendant was arrested at approximately 8:30am in New Hampshire, and the Government expects that she will be presented before a Untied States Magistrate Judge in the District of New Hampshire this afternoon. The Government intends to seek the defendant’s detention, and if that application is denied in New Hampshire, the Government expects to seek an appeal of that determination before Judge Nathan.

The AUSAs on this case are cc’d on this email, and I have listed our respective phone numbers below:

We would be very grateful if the Court would be able to set an initial conference date that the Government can convey at this afternoon’s presentment. We can be reached at any time should the Court have any questions.

Respectfully,

Assistant United States Attorney
