I sent pic and stuff to

But bear in mind that what they want is detailed briefing for brass — not, as of yet, a more summary memo for AG (though that request may come)

We did briefings on most of these for our meeting down in DC in December. I’m not sure the teams have the final copies of what we sent down, but we might want to give them those to update rather than starting a new?

and are meeting with the AG on Monday, and he asked to be briefed on our sensitives cases. The political stuff and Epstein. I have spoken to the teams about preparing detailed briefing memos for __________ — they will get us drafts tomorrow, to get to the brass by Thursday morning. Then we’ll meet with brass toward end of week. Not ideal for me to be out Friday, but nothing I can do about it.
