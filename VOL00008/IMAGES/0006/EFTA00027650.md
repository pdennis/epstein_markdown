Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for another witness in the Maxwell trial—[REDACTED]. I expect he'll testify on 12/2, but he could possible bleed over into 12/3, so I'd like to have him fly in on 12/1 and out on the evening of 12/3. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you, as always, for your help.
