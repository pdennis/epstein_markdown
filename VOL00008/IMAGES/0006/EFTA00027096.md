Subject: Draft letter to Congress on Epstein

This is the letter that we intend to send to the congressional leaders. Please review and let me know if you have concerns about any of the specific statements. This attempts to take into consideration your comments from last night. Apologies for the tight turnaround, but if you can review and revert with any issues in the next hour, that would be appreciated.

Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General
