Can we all dial into the call on Daubert and then talk about that?

I'm actually thinking maybe we should all take a look at the very short list in category 4, to make sure we're fine with it.

Team,

Do you want me to send this to the defense as it is, or are there parts we want to spot check, or are there any other steps you want me to take before we send out?

Subject: RE: joint letter

Hey _______________ – the draft letter is attached, with all four categories filled in with the respective juror numbers. I'm also attaching the Excel sheet, containing defense and government objections, that contains all four lists in four different sheets. This Excel sheet is also saved on the shared in the jury selection folder.

If anything needs to be edited, I'll be around for a bit longer today but I'm unavailable later this afternoon/evening, after 3:30pm today. _______________ have kindly offered to handle any edits tonight when I'm offline, so I can loop them in if necessary.

Thanks so much!

Hi ___________________________________________________________________________________________.

Thanks so much for all you're doing today, really appreciate it. Attached is a draft of the joint letter for today with the four categories. Could you please fill those in after you've had a chance to enter all the data from the defense? I'm fine with charts in each of the four questions (essentially just one row of cells with juror numbers). Also fine with bullet points. Whichever is easiest.

Whenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know – we'll need to send this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon.

Thanks!
