Andy,

Attached are unredacted and redacted copies of the notes. As discussed, we intend to produce redacted copies of the notes pursuant to the protective order, and produce Mr. [redacted] name and your contact information to defense counsel on an AEO basis. The file name will be changed to the bates number so it will not include his name.

I'm also copying my co-counsel [redacted], please include them on emails going forward. Finally, [redacted] is aware that we are providing these notes to you.

Thanks, and please feel free to give us a call to discuss.

Please send us a copy of the disclosure that you are considering as to Mr. [redacted]. Seeing the planned disclosure about our client will help us fashion a means of addressing the concerns we discussed last night. Many thanks,
