Hi

In connection with the Epstein case (2018R01618), we would like to request permission to travel this week for victim interviews in Palm Beach, Florida. Our agents will be there starting tomorrow, through Sunday, and our current plan is for some combination of our team ( , , and me) to be there from Thursday*** through Sunday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for those four days.

Thanks very much,

***we would never miss the BBQ.

The trip will be some combination of me, , and/or , as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
