Submission on behalf of
☐ Unk
☐ nown
☐ profile _______________________________.

Attached is a draft of the factual statement, just so that you can better understand the facts that we are presenting.

We feel that given ___________ abuse, and given the fact that we see her basically as a cog in Epstein's wheel, acting entirely at his direction and doing what she did at a time that she herself was a very vulnerable victim, a non-pros would be the appropriate disposition. But we want to discuss this with you before we finalize this and make a submission.

Thanks
