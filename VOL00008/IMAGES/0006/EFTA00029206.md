If a majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this corporation, as the case may be, and also on this corporation.

EIGHTH: For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and in further definition, limitation, and regulation of the powers of the corporation and of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided:

1. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors.

AGREEMENT |   | I agree that this account is an account under The General Terms for Accounts and Services and is
pledged as collateral for all of my obligations and is subject to the security interest provisions in
The General Terms for Accounts and Services, the terms of which are incorporated by reference.
The General Terms for Accounts and Services together with this application are the security
agreement under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as amended from time to time.  |
|  I LINKING
AGREEMENT |   | JPMorgan Private Bank calculates an earning credit/fee allowance on aggregated business checking account balances. This
allowance is netted against fees for maintenance and services used, as listed on my current fee schedule. If the fee allowance
is not sufficient to cover the services used, a fee is charged to the primary Business Checking Account.
By linking my multiple no-interest bearing Checking accounts, I can use the combined account balances to avoid or minimize interest
charges incurred due to an overdraft in any one or more of the linked accounts. Note that linking can reduce or eliminate interest
charges due to overdrafts, but does not prevent the overdrafts themselves. Each day, the collected balances in all linked accounts are
added together. If the net balance is negative, overdraft interest charges will be calculated on that negative balance.
I understand that linking Checking Accounts as described above may have legal, tax or other ramifications under applicable U.S. or
other laws or rules (owing to, for example, different legal entities owning linked accounts and incurring or paying charges on behalf
of each other or having their assets offset against each other's). By signing below, I represent that I and the other Accountholders
have consulted with our legal, financial, tax or other advisers on these matters, accept the linkage so created, and will manage the
accounts to prevent any negative repercussions. I agree to hold harmless from and indemnify JPMorgan Private Bank and each of its
affiliates, officers, directors, agents and other representatives against any liability relating in any way to its provision of account
linking services to myself or the Accountholders of the linked Checking Accounts. Other terms applicable to your Accounts are
continued in The General Terms for Accounts and Services, Account Agreements, and Appendices.  |

General Terms for Accounts and Services, Account Agreements, Rate and Fee Schedules, and Appendices, and Supplemental
Forms which comprise the Agreement between you and me ("Agreement"). I further acknowledge that I will notify you

me. I also agree that each of the Accounts I am applying for is pledged as Collateral for all of my obligations. I also acknowledge
that I have read and consent to the terms of the JPMorgan Private Bank Privacy Policy, including the manner in which my
