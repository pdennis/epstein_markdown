Can you please (1) PDF the attached letters; (2) place the PDF of the letter re in each of their NTW 3500 folders; and (3) put the letter re in a NTW 3500 folder (I believe we do not yet have a NTW 3500 folder for ). You can move these into Production 3 as and I will start that review early this week. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
