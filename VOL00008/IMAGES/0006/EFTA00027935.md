It appears there is new information about the phone call at 7:17pm Friday night.

The Warden briefed OIG SAC Modano that the call was 19 minutes long. I did not brief the Warden on any information regarding that call.

Epstein was never in general population, because of that he did not need an approved list of people to call.

On Friday he had a legal visit that lasted from 8:00ish an until almost 7:00pm. He was supervised the entire time by BOP staff.
