All,

Per the attached, the Court granted the one-week extension in the Epstein FOIA. So the production is now due next Friday, July 2. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with that date.

Please also let me know if you need anything else from me in terms of the processes we discussed yesterday. We are working with BOP to finalize the production, but please let me know if I should take steps beyond that (e.g., letting additional people know about the production, etc.).

Also, does anyone want to see the production before it goes out?

Thanks,

Hi all,

The Times consented to the one-week request. I think it is likely the Court will approve it. I plan to file the attached letter, which includes the changes we discussed on the phone, around 6:30. Please let me know if you have any issues or concerns. I'll let you know as soon as the Court rules.

Thanks,

Hi all,

We now have a 5:45 call scheduled with the Times. Please let me know before then if there's any other info I can share with them. I'm attaching a draft extension request letter here for review. Please let me know if this looks okay, or if we need to discuss anything,

Thanks,

Hi all,

I just spoke with [REDACTED], who spoke with [REDACTED]. I can make this request, but I am not sure it will be successful. Before I speak to the Times about it, I need to know a little bit more info about what I can share with the Times and what is going on. Could someone please give me a call at [REDACTED]? I need to connect with the Times as soon as possible because we will need to put in the request today to PAE.

Thanks,

Hi [REDACTED],

We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by [REDACTED], and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which were just completed, to confirm we agree they've fulfilled that requirement of their deferred prosecution agreements. She's going to speak with [REDACTED], about it as well. Is this doable?

Thanks,
