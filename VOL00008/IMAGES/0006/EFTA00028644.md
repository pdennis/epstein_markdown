Subject: FW: 21-770 United States of America v. Maxwell "Motion FILED for bail"
Date: Tue, 18 May 2021 05:14:20 +0000
Attachments: Maxwell_renewed_bail_motion.pdf

After the Circuit rejected her prior bail appeal, Maxwell filed the attached “renewed motion” in the Circuit in the same docket. Can anyone think of a reason she can’t do that? Even if it’s not procedurally proper, it probably doesn’t get us much, as she could just file a new notice of appeal from AJN’s latest order and then file the same motion in the Circuit...
