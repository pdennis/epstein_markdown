I was hoping we'd have time to catch up internally before meeting with chiefs but looks like that won't be successful. You both available for a quick mtg later this morning and then we can debrief them? I think [redacted] has trial witness prep but maybe we can grab even ten mins. Ugh I'm so exhausted.

I'm traveling back today, could we set a time for Monday? Once I get in later I'm slammed with stuff that has come up the past few days in other cases.
