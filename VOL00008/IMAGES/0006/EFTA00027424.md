## A. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN CASES

- US v. Ghislaine Maxwell, USAO 2018R01618 (AUSAs [redacted]): On June 29, 2020 a grand jury returned a six count indictment charging Maxwell for her role in facilitating Epstein’s abuse of minor girls. Maxwell was arrested on July 2 at a residence in New Hampshire and has been detained since. The team made an initial discovery production on or about August 21, 2020, and is working on a second discovery production of electronic materials in the coming month. The team is also working with the USAO-SDFL, OPR and the West Palm Beach Police Department among other sources to obtain and review materials relevant to the prior investigation. Additionally, the team is in the process of reaching out to counsel for [redacted] to begin initial discussions about the possibility of a felony disposition. We are also continuing to pursue a potential interview with Prince Andrew, and after his counsel declined to make him available for a voluntary interview, we notified OIA that we wished to proceed with an MLAT. We completed discovery in November 2020. Maxwell expects to make a renewed bail application in the next weeks based in part on conditions at MDC and a substantial bail package. We expect to oppose.
