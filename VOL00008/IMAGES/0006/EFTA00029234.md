&gt; Thanks for reaching out. I've cc'd [Redacted] who are leading this. For future victims the best number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. The calls are tracked and then pushed out to the investigative teams and appropriate offices. It takes a couple of minutes to get through the dial-in instructions, but then you are speaking to a live call taker who pushes us the info. As for the victim you are referencing, if you pass [Redacted] the contact information of your fried, he can have someone on his team go from there.

&gt; Thanks for the info and have a quiet summer.

&gt; [Redacted] is a former agent originally in Newark. She references potential victims below. [Redacted] contact info is:

- Hello! So proud of you! You've done such a phenomenal job everywhere you have been stationed!
- I have an investigative journalist friend I trust with my life, who was working with a female retired cop on human trafficking. They came across a male victim who appears to be very credible and his story closely aligns and is very possibly part of the stuff with Epstein. He was young when the abuse happened but he has information about the entire process and specifics on high level government people; one former president. My friend is hoping to get him to the NYO ASAP to give a statement and be interviewed. My friend, [redacted] (not that [redacted]), used to be in the USIC and feels not only is the guy credible, his story should be vetted by better equipped entities aka FBI. I haven't been involved in this case as I'm at Discover Financial Services and busy as heck. But [redacted] reached out to me and I watched portions of a videotaped interview of the guy and I feel he sounds truthful but needs to speak with you guys. Is there a direct POC I can have [redacted] contact to set this up. Someone who knows the story of trafficking and sexual exploitation of children? I will email that person [redacted] contact information or give [redacted] his/her information. Btw, the female retired cop is now deceased and I have had a few alleged victims reach out to me. I will refer any of them to the FBI in their area. There are a lot.
- I also was in contact with now murdered Arkansas Senator Linda Collins Smith. Briefly but about a CPS corruption case. I believe the FBI is working her murder. I only knew her for a few months but it was a shock. She had a lot of information on child trafficking. Hopefully the FBI got it. ABC wants to interview me on my friendship with her but I'm hesitant to do it.
- Thank you [redacted] I do believe this guy has valuable information.
- Sincerely,
