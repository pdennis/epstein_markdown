&gt; Pg 3 - Statement in quotes is correct.
&gt; Pg. 3 - They give inmates jackets while they wait, but they are not
&gt; allowed to bring other clothes down there (in R&amp;D). No utensils needed
&gt; for sandwiches or an apple or milk, etc..

&gt; My last email sent before I had a chance to write an email. Thanks
&gt; very much for speaking today. We have incorporated our discussion into
&gt; the attached draft letter to Judge Nathan. Would you please review the
&gt; draft very closely and let us know if there are any inaccuracies in it?

&gt; I highlighted several sentences where we need additional information
&gt; from you. As we mentioned earlier, our letter is due today, November 2,
&gt; at 12 PM. Can you please send us any comments no later than 9:30 am?
&gt; I
&gt; will call you early tomorrow morning.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks very much,
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Thanks, when can you speak today? Our letter is due tomorrow at 12 PM.
&gt;&gt; Also, we need to update the court in that letter about the hard drive
&gt; we
&gt;&gt; sent to you on Friday. Can you please let us know the status of whether
&gt;&gt; that has been picked up? I can provide a tracking number if helpful.
&gt;&gt; Thanks again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; FYI - she has received mail from USPS on the 29th. The USPS website is not always up to date so there's not much more we can do. Also, staff does not pick up mail from the post office on Saturday's, only Monday through Friday.
