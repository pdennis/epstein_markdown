Does anyone want to review the full doc once ☐ circulates? I can fill out the into paragraph, add in the docket cite to my section, and then send to the chiefs.

Attached are my sections. Thanks very much for your patience with me on this, team. Between the move and getting sick, I've had trouble keeping on top of things over the past week. Happy to incorporate this into the master doc if you want to send it to me.

Updated version attached – I’ve accepted all edits and added no new edits (nice work, team). Just one question for [redacted]:

[redacted line], this goes to you next. If you can add your points when you edit, that would be great. Thanks.

Here is a current draft of the opposition. I wanted to circulate this so others could start editing/reviewing the other sections. My suggestions/nits are in track changes.

Team,

Checking in on the status for the motions. I’m attaching the NPA point draft, which can be folded in. Can folks let me know the status of pending motion points, for planning purposes? I think our deadline to get this to the chiefs is EOD today, so ideally we’d combine this by this afternoon and circulate quickly around the team for edits.

Thanks all—
