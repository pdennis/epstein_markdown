Check out pages 38-39 of his state plea:

Epstein counsel: “[T]here is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney’s office that triggers as a result of this plea agreement. In other words, they have signed off and said they will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for any offense upon his successful taking of his plea today. That is a confidential document that the parties have agreed to. Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted to tell the court.”

[. . .]

The Court: “Mr. Epstein, your attorney has told me that in addition to everything, we talked about another inducement, shall we say, to your taking this plea is that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement with you, meaning that if you successfully complete probation and do everything you’re supposed to, they have, have agreed not to prosecute you federally, did you understand that?”

The Defendant: “Yes, ma’am.”

The prosecutor then notes that SDFL people (“they”) were in court for the plea.
