&gt; It appears there is new information about the phone call at 7:17pm Friday night.
&gt;
&gt; The Warden briefed OIG SAC Modano that the call was 19 minutes long. I did not brief the Warden on any information regarding that call.
&gt;
&gt; Epstein was never in general population, because of that he did not need an approved list of people to call.
&gt;
&gt; On Friday he had a legal visit that lasted from 8:00ish an until almost 7:00pm. He was supervised the entire time by BOP staff.
