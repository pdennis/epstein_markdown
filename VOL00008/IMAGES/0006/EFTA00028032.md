She called our 800 line. She said that it took her many years and months to get the courage to call. She called the FBI hotline but nobody got back to her and she called _________________________. She has applied for the Victim Compensation fund. She wanted to know if she could come to the trial. I told her that I will do whatever I can within the Judges rules to let her view the trial.

She met Epstein and Maxwell 25 years ago has had a hard time reliving the events. She has the gown that she was wearing and the presents that they gave her. No pictures. This might be nothing. She was very nice and asked me for help. She lives in _________________________.
