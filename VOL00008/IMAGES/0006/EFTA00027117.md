Sorry about the abrupt prior email. I was hoping to get the names so we could ensure we have enough vests for everyone.

I just found out that additional law enforcement agents will be joining but I don't know how many and who. I asked. I'm sorry!

Hi _______________.

Not a problem. I will add them to the list. Do you have everyone's titles?
I will advise the Warden of the request that he accompany us on the tour.
Thank you,

Two additional people from DOJ will join the visit:

In addition, Geoff has asked that the new acting warden join the tour. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks.

If it is not too much of an imposition, we ask that all visitors come to our front lobby for screening before admission.
Thanks!

Yes, thank you. Where should we go?

Hi

It should not be a problem. Does 10 am work for Mr. Berman and the rest of his staff?

Thank you,

Supervisory Staff Attorney

The list of visitors from our office is below:

Geoffrey Berman

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney

Southern District of New York
