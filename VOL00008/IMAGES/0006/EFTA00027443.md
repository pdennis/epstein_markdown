Hi _______________.

That's fine. I'll likely pass them along to our General Counsel's Office who handles these issues.

I wanted to give you a heads up that an AUSA in our Civil Division is handling an Epstein-related FOIA request. He has been keeping us informed as that matter proceeds. He may need to speak with someone in OIG, so if it's okay with you, we would pass along your name and contact info.

Hope you're doing well,
