Hi _________________________________________________________________________

When you rename this folder, could you please also break the folder into review batches of 500-documents each, and assign a third to me, a third to _________________________________________________________________________, and a third to _________________________________________________________________________?

Thanks very much,
________________________________________________________

Hi _________________________________________________________________________

Thanks very much for the quick response. We would like all tags in one field with check boxes, please. We want to be able to tag each document with multiple tags if appropriate.

Also, in the same "US v Epstein" database, would it be possible to please rename the folder entitled "Florida Investigation FOIA Files_2" to "FBI Files from Florida Office"? The new title will help us understand what is actually in that folder.

Thanks very much,

Good Morning,

Do you want all of these tags in one field on in several fields? Also do you want these tags in both of the Epstein Relativity databases?

Thank you.
