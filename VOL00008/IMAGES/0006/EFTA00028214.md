Thanks, I saw the preliminary instructions letter on the shared (attached). If everyone is ok with this, I can file to take something off your plate. If you can send me the final bail letter, I'm happy to handle filing if that's helpful.

I already cite checked the bail opp and wrote the letter re prelim voir dire instructions (will circulate). I can handle docketing later. Just waiting on feedback from [REDACTED] on BOP letters. Do you think I need to send to [REDACTED] from the marshals?

Team,

We have three things due today: (1) the bail opposition, (2) the letter saying we don't object to preliminary instructions, and (3) Daubert. Looks like items 1 and 2 are done, so when we talk this morning let's discuss a timetable for getting stuff docketed. I think [REDACTED] and I should probably handle 1 and 2, since [REDACTED] have a packed Daubert evening, but let's coordinate.

Thanks!

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
