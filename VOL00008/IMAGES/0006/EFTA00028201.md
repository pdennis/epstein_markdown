I added the field to the view and you should see it when you log into the database.

Hi

In the "US v. Epstein (SW Returns)" I'm trying to see the NYC serial number reflecting which device a particular document came from. In the past, you helped me add a column in Relativity to show the NYC serial number for each document. Would you be able to help me with that again, please?

Thanks,
