Me too, thanks. Attached are the versions she plans to file by 5, FYI. The paragraph on the trial team's availability is the last paragraph in the letter.

Maxwell filed her substantive trial adjournment letter today at 12, and our response is due at 5. I'd like to run one thing by you that we plan to put in the response regarding our availability for trial if you have a couple of minutes to discuss. Let me know when is convenient and I'll give you a call, thank you.
