Counsel,

We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you today. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production will be made via USAfx.

We will send a CD with the new production to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. As always, if you would prefer that she receive the production on a drive, we can either request that the MDC send us one of the drives back to load with the production, or we can load a new drive if you would like to provide us with one.

Chris, we reached out to MDC about your question from Thursday afternoon regarding the photo viewer program. We will get back to you once we have more information.

Thanks,
