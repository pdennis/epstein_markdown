Hey thank you, we really appreciate it -- it's obviously shocking even given all the circumstances, and extremely disappointing for the victims (and, y'know, the cause of justice more generally). I think we're just working through the many phone calls and updates today, but it's thoughtful of you to reach out so thanks very much again.

All,

Sorry to see the sad news about Epstein. I'm sure you're shaken. , and I went through a similar suicide three years ago with a securities fraud defendant. If you need anything, we're here for you. You were doing you're job and obviously no one wishes harm to come to anyone.
