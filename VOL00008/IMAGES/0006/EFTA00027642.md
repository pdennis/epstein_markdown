Hey ☐ I'm attaching the scanned proffer (it's saved in her Witnesses &amp; Cooperators folder, located here: ☐

Is there another location you'd like it saved as well? Thanks!

Hi ☐

I'm having a hard time locating the most recent scan of the ☐ proffer agreement – it should be updated as of 9/21. I'm probably just looking in the wrong place. Could you please send me the scan? If it's not on the shared, the original should be in the para file.

Thanks!
