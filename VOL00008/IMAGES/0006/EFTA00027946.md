Thanks. Did he provide more substance beyond he heard information relating to Epstein? If so, let's talk Monday.

Let me know if you want to meet with [REDACTED], and we haven't yet decided whether to extend him a cooperation agreement.

Hi [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].

I just spoke with [REDACTED], who got a call from an aspiring cooperator at MCC named [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] reported that another MCC inmate known [REDACTED]—gave him information relating to Epstein. For several months, [REDACTED] has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and third-hand information that’s not actionable unless another inmate also cooperates. We can also talk in person next week about the relative quality of his information.

I leave it to you guys to follow up with [REDACTED] as you see fit. I’m sure someone on this email can make [REDACTED] available to you, if you want, once you get a sense of what he’s about. I just don’t want to unilaterally sit on this.

Have a nice weekend!
