Hi

Brief attached. Before you make the TOC, will you do a quick scroll through to confirm that (1) there's no weird spacing issues, and (2) the only highlighting is green? I just did that but could use someone double-checking.

Thanks!

You can send it to me, thanks. Are you going to need a TOA and TOC or just one or the other?
