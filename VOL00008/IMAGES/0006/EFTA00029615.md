Subject: Conflict Check (2021 Annual Sweep)

Importance: High

Good afternoon,

asked me to help manage the Office's annual check for cases that might raise a conflict for a supervisor. For example, you may be working on a case that involves ABC Corp.; and even though the case would not create a conflict for you, if anybody in your line of supervision owns more than de minimis ABC Corp. stock, that supervisor will have a conflict and we need to keep the case away from him or her.

Attached is a list of your cases and a list of the entities—corporations and law firms—that may create a conflict for one of your supervisors. There is one list for the Crim Div and one list for the Civ Div.

If any of your cases involves one of those entities (other than routine subpoenas to banks and service providers), please (using Adobe's Add Text functionality) type in the Asset ID code(s) for the pertinent entity(ies). Save and return the form to me.

Negative responses are required.
