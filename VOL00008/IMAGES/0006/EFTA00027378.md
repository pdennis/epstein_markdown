Ok for me to park at 1 St. Andrews on 4/13 through 4/16 so that I can be present for this review, please?

Yes. I say by 9:15 so a 9:30 start time each day seems right.

Thanks so much! So the Marshals are willing to produce her multiple days in a row? And do you know what time they plan to arrive with her at 500 Pearl?

Subject: Request to Produce Ghislaine Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street

Hi <table><tr><td></td></tr></table>

Following up on our earlier conversation, defense counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell (USMS No. <table> ) has requested to schedule time for Maxwell and her attorneys to review physical evidence in the FBI's custody. The FBI and AUSAs are able to bring the evidence to the 500 Pearl proffer rooms in order for the review to take place there. Defense counsel have requested that the first day of review take place on Tuesday, April 13, 2021. Because there is a large volume of items to review, defense counsel expects that the review will take multiple days. They have requested that Maxwell be produced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is completed.

Would it be possible to please have Maxwell produced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete? My best estimate is that the review will take four days, so Maxwell would need to be produced on April 13, 14, 15, and 16. That said, it is always possible the defense will need more time, which would push into the next week.

Thanks very much for your help.
