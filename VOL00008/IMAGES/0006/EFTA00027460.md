Good thought to do this.

I spoke with Mark Epstein’s lawyer (Stacey Richman) just now, and she was enormously appreciative of the head’s up, and asked how Mark could get a copy of everything that’s been released, because he’s been dying to get his hands on anything related to what happened. I told her to submit a FOIA request and to let us know when she had done so, and we’d make sure the BOP received it. [redacted] told me that he would make sure BOP responds in a timely fashion.

OCME was similarly very appreciative of the head’s up. [redacted] is making the production this afternoon.

Sound right to me.

[redacted],

I spoke with the GC of OCME and she was very appreciative of the head’s up. She asked whether we intended to provide notice to the family about the autopsy report’s release, which is something they would normally do. As we discussed, we have not provided a head’s up to the Estate given that they are on notice of the FOIA litigation. As you may recall, though, we met with Epstein’s brother in the course of our investigation, and he is represented by Stacey Richman. After giving it some thought, I don’t see much of a downside to giving Stacey a call on Friday to give her a head’s up about the production of the autopsy report, which seems to be the human thing to do. Do you guys have any objection?
