Following up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact info – I’m reachable at this email address or by phone at [redacted] (office) or [redacted] (cell). Please don’t hesitate to reach out anytime day or night if we can provide any useful info, or if you have any questions at all, and we appreciate you talking with us about the records information. Let us know if it makes sense to set up another call for Friday or early next week to check in on the questions we had, and thanks very much for your help.

thanks again,
Alex.
