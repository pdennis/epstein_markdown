Subject: Confidential - Epstein

, , provided us with your contact info. As the prior criminal defense attorneys for Mr Epstein, and with the approval of the attorney for his Estate, we would ask for you to consider allowing one or more of us to view any videos showing his jail cell at the MCC or the hallway leading to the entry to his jail cell from midnight-7 AM on Aug 10, 2019. We would appreciate your consideration of this request.

If we can otherwise help, let us know.

Thanks

Marty

Martin G. Weinberg, Esq.
