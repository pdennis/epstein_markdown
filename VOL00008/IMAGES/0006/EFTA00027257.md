Geoff and

Just wanted you both to know that we've been receiving a positive response from NGOs on the Epstein case – not just in terms of the charges brought, but also in terms of the opportunity created for victims to be heard. I was in court for part of today, and I'm not sure that I've experienced anything like it. I am very proud of the way that our Office has handled this case and investigation, and I hope that it encourages more victims to come forward.

Thank you.
