Dear Ms. Strauss:

Enclosed is the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Report of Investigation into the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of Its 2006-2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation. An Executive Summary appears at the beginning of the report. Although OPR’s investigation did not involve your Office, we are providing you with the Report because it may be relevant to ongoing litigation being handled by your Office.

In addition, because this matter has received extraordinary public attention and has been the subject of Congressional inquiries, the Department of Justice is today publicly releasing the Executive Summary. The Department does not plan to publicly release the full report at this time, but will provide it to Congress upon its request. Congress may choose to release the full report to the public. In addition, it is possible that all or parts of the report may become public through the processing of Freedom of Information Act requests.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about this matter.

Sincerely,

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
