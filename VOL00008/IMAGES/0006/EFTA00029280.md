Subject: Video Status
Date: Wed, 27 Nov 2019 17:32:56 +0000

Just FYI regarding the video status as a whole... You can see the questions I asked our tech people at the bottom. We can discuss this next week after the holiday...

Hope everyone has a safe and happy Thanksgiving!

I got looped into the discussion below and you can see the responses that floated around. You are correct in your assumption of DVR2, we have not done anything with it since the dates are outside your dates of interest and manual rebuilding of DVR2 was not going to be a simple task.

To that end, the data on DVR2 might (major emphasis on might) be recoverable, but this will be a long term project, likely 6 or more months, requiring research and testing, in order to potentially obtain useable video from the DVR. There is no guarantee of success and that must be weighed with how much time and resource we want to throw at It vs what you MIGHT be able recover.

If this is something you want OTD/DFAS/DFAU to move forward with, let's discuss it further via conference call and then we'll ask you to follow up with a EC request to address this specifically.

Thanks,

I worked on DVR1, and helped [redacted] export part of the day of interest.

has the paperwork; and list of cameras that were available for DVR1

I have not worked on DVR2 at all.

If there is a Data Recovery need for DVR2, then please write an EC requesting what you want recovered. I am CC'ing (My Supervisor) to keep him in the loop.

Good Morning [REDACTED] ---

I know you guys have had a nice break from everything Epstein... However, I'm back ☐ We are preparing for discovery now and I have to get exact answers regarding all the video that we have available. I apologize in advance for all of these questions!

- We are going to turn over all available footage for the SHU area at MCC – which is on CH0082, CH0080, and CH0062. To download all of this footage, what size hard drive will be needed (or how many should I request)?
- What is the total number of cameras that are available on DVR1?
- We don't have a camera list that actually correctly names the location of the cameras, correct? Lists that I have seen were wrong but I'm not sure if one exists that is correct...
- As far as DVR 2, there was a system failure that caused that DVR to stop recording. I know that there would be no available footage beyond July 29 for that DVR. I also know that QT was going to have to try and rebuild it manually. Did they ever recover any footage or did they discontinue efforts once we told them that dates prior to July 29th weren't of interest? I'm not sure where they left off with that part...

Thanks!
