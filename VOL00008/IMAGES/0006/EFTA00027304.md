All set, it's been added to both folders. On a related note, do we have a set deadline for producing testifying witness 3500 and GX to defense/the court yet, or is it still too early?

Hi

Would one of you please save the attached in the testifying witness 3500 folder and the witness folder for Larry Visoski on the Epstein share?

Thanks
