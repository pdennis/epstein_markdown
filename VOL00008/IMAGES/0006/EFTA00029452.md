Thanks, [REDACTED] Yes, we will make the production tomorrow. We anticipate it will take the Times at least a few days to get through it (although we don’t know for sure on that front). We can let you know once we’ve released it tomorrow if that’d be helpful.

Morning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. She asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn’t a problem. Other than process questions, [REDACTED] and I anticipate declining to comment anyway.

Do we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a hard time hearing during the call, but my impression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks.
