All,

Thanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we have discussed. We want to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this along since you've asked us to send you a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final from our perspective, and this may change following our conversations with victims during the conferral process.

We recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not want to delay notifying the victims, and, as we've discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims notifying them that we are in plea negotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your client in the next few days, so let's plan to talk mid-week.

Thanks,

EFTA00028140
