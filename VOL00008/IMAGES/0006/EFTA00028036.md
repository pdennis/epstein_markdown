I finished a first check of the document and have attached what comments I had. I was not able to check stuff like the docket numbers or citations to previous briefs or motions in this case. That said the case cites look good overall, if there is any other way I can help or if there is something you want me to go back and check again just let me know.

Thanks,

Thanks. If you come across cites that you can't check because you don't have access to the document, just highlight it and I'll check it at the end.

Thanks, [REDACTED]! Our filing is due today, so the sooner the better. But why don't we plan to check in around 3:30 or so and see where you are, and we can get others on board to help at that point if it makes sense.

Great! I will make sure to do so if I do. Just to check, is there a deadline you need this by? It shouldn't take too long but just wanted to check.

Thanks,

Good Morning,

My name is [REDACTED] and I am an intern in the office assigned to [REDACTED]. He told me to reach out to you as I believe you wanted something cite checked? If so I would be happy to help with whatever the assignment is.

Thank you,
