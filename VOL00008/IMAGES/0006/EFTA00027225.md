Don't need to scan the OB211 form in. For the fax confirmations, I'm good with you just retaining the record.

They are all sent. Do I need to resave the subpoenas with the OB211 attached in pdf form? I just printed them separately and combined them in hard copy form. Also, with the fax confirmations shall I scan them and merge them with the subpoenas with which they were served?

Can you send all of these out? All Epstein related. To each of them can you attach the OB211 form at the end, which I've also attached. Thanks!
