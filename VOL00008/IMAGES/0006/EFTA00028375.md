Thank you, I was just about to send the application, which I'm attaching here for Your Honor's consideration. I have copied the affiant (Special Agent [REDACTED]), who is available at the Court's convenience this evening.

Apologies for the late hour, and thank you in advance for taking the time to review this evening. I am available a [REDACTED] if there are any questions.

Respectfully,

If you have the application and proposed warrant ready by 11:00 I will review it tonight. If not, since it does not seem to be an emergency, you should present the application to Judge Pitman tomorrow.
