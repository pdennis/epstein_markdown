Just got a call from __________, he spoke with Scarola and __________ and she is apparently willing to meet with us. He seemed to have no compunction about meeting in person, and either his or Scarola's office, and they're all (including __________) local in West Palm. I told him we'd get back to him sometime this week on whether it makes more sense to do a webex / zoom / call rather than for us to fly, and we can circle up on that later today any time. Kind of an odd series of developments with her, obviously, given the extreme difficulties we had in meeting with her previously, but here we are.
