Hi

We would like to schedule a call to chat about an issue that came up when I was reviewing the physical evidence from the Epstein file on Friday. and I are all free tonight from 6pm to 7pm, tonight from 7:30pm to 8pm, or tomorrow from 1pm to 3pm. Is there a time in any of those windows when we could have a call, please?

Thanks,

EFTA00027377
