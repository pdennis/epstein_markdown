Re: [Redacted] / File# 14-000107

To Whom it May Concern:

Please be advised that the historical employment records you are requesting, for the time period of "1999-2001" are no longer available.

I can confirm that a [Redacted] appears on a spreadsheet dated back to 2000 which lists terminated employees for that time (year 2000). Unfortunately, I am unable to confirm whether or not this is the same person due to the fact no other information is listed such as a social security number, address, position, etc. The only information listed is a first and last name.

Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me at [Redacted].

Sincerely,

[Signature Line]
