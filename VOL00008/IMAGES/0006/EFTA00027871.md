Hi

Our next update regarding Maxwell's conditions of confinement is due on Tuesday 4/6. Is there a time tomorrow or Monday when we could please have a call to check in and get an update? In particular, it would be useful to talk through the issues raised in defense counsel's most recent letter on this topic, which I've attached here for reference.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
