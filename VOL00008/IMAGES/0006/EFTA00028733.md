Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

Today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These discovery materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02753432 through SDNY_GM_02753551 and SDNY_GM_SUPP_00219450 through SDNY_GM_SUPP_00219451.

Regarding the materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02753529 through SDNY_GM_02753551, these folders contain native image files from several devices that correspond with images previously produced to you in PDF format on November 9, 2020. The enclosed spreadsheet indicates which control numbers with "SDNY_GM_SUPP" prefixes correspond with these native "carved" images. The enclosed spreadsheet also details the original file names of the "carved" files that were previously produced to you in their native format, also on November 9, 2020.

Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. An index of the materials contained in this production is below:
