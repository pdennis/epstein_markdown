Hi all,

Attached please find a letter just filed by Maxwell’s counsel regarding sleep deprivation. She asks “the Court to address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.” Judge Nathan has not yet ordered any response but we wanted to send this along to you. Please let us know if a call would be useful.

Thanks,
