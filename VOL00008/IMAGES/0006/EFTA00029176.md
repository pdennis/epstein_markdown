I've gone back through the memo and softened/modified a number of my comments. Do you want to hold off on sending back to the team until ______ reaches out? Since we're not telling them to cut the ______ section (yet), I would be inclined to send this back now so they can start working through our comments, and then ______ can reach out later today? I also think it would be helpful both to morale and to getting ______ up to speed to have ______ review the memo as drafted before telling them to cut the ______ section.

Hey _______________________________________________________________________

Are you able to reach out to the team to set something up for the next couple days? We are about to flip our edits to their memo back to them, and I want to be sure we have the teleconference with you before this memo is finalized.

Thanks!
