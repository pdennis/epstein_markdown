What case am I using to bring witnesses into SDNY. I can only bring people in for GJ, pretrial, trial and sometimes pre GJ.

For the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment.

If you are interviewing more people in an investigation you are going to have to travel to them.

I am not giving anyone a hard time I just need to follow the rules.

Please let me know.

Dear [redacted]

I spoke to [redacted] yesterday and she confirmed that she is still interested in speaking with our clients.

[redacted] is still available to meet with prosecutors on August 26, 2019 at 12:00 p.m. in New York.

Please let me know what information you need from me to arrange flights/hotel stay for Ms. [redacted].

Additionally, you previously mentioned that there may be counseling resources available for our clients. Could you send me that information as well?

Thank you, [redacted]
