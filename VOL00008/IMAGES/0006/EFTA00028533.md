Privileged &amp; Confidential

I hope this email finds you well. As discussed during our August 10, 2020 call, please find attached a cover letter accompanying JPMorgan’s production in response to the August 11, 2019, August 16, 2019, September 3, 2019, and October 9, 2019 grand jury subpoenas. As with previous productions, you will receive a separate email with instructions to download the production. You will receive the password under separate cover.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.

Thanks very much,
Kelsey
