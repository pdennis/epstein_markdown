## PRESS GUIDANCE

Tuesday, November 23, 2021

*OFF-THE-RECORD. AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion [attached] requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy.

9:30 a.m. – Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell – the defendant is charged in connection to conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity – before Judge Alison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse]).

**EXHIBITS:** Government exhibits will be provided exclusively through the SDNY file share. If you are unable to access this link to the file share (USAFx), you must establish an account to access the files. To establish an

Please also note that all case filings in U.S. v. Maxwell are available in the Court’s electronic filing system; we encourage media representatives to establish a free PACER account, if they have not done so already. Credentialing and other matters relating to in-person attendance for the trial are handled by the SDNY District Executive’s Office.

Periodic updates to follow.
