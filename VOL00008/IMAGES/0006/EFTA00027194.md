Re: Grand Jury Subpoena

This letter describes the procedure for requesting reimbursement for subpoenaed records.

12 CFR part 219 (subpart A), issued by the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System under section 1115 of the Right to Financial Privacy Act (12 U.S.C. § 3415), sets the rates and conditions for reimbursement of costs directly incurred by financial institutions in assembling or providing customer financial records to a government authority pursuant to the Act. No costs are reimbursable if the records are those of a corporation or a partnership comprised of more than five individuals.

If reimbursement is authorized, and the estimated billing to the government will exceed $500, advance permission is necessary from [redacted] at [redacted].

If the subpoenaed records indicated on the rider are eligible for reimbursement, please complete section B of the enclosed form OBD-211, which will serve as your invoice, and return it with a copy of the subpoena to the following address:

U.S. Attorney's Office - SDNY
Accounts Payable
86 Chambers Street, 3rd floor
New York, NY 10007
(212) 637-2662

Please send your invoice to the above address within 60 days of the submission of the subpoenaed records. If no invoice is received within 120 days, funds will not be available to pay the invoice.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Very truly yours,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
