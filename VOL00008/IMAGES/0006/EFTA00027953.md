Totally agree. If you guys are up for handling (or if [redacted] is able to handle solo), I'd definitely like to use the time in the office today before being out for the next few days. But I'm around until noon, so if folks would like me to join, I certainly can.

I think this is probably eminently handle-able by one person, unless anybody disagrees? [redacted] I'm happy to join if you'd like, or to just handle, or if you feel like doing it then I'm totally happy to defer (and I'll just continue to prep for California interviews). Agree with [redacted] that certainly in the first instance it's likely to involve getting a list of names and not particularly credibility-heavy, such that we'd want a couple people to be able to weigh in on the info up the chain. Thoughts?

Sorry, this got lost in my inbox. No problem at all if you still need to skip this.

Sorry to ask, but is it okay if I don't join you guys for Monday's interview with [redacted]? I'm trying to find time to meet with another case team, and it looks like Monday morning would work best for that.

[redacted] was Epstein's long-time house manager in NY, but we don't know anything beyond that, so the purpose of the interview is really just to identify other employees and see what if anything he saw at the house.
