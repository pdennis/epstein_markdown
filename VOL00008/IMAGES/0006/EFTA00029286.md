More information you need for the issues raised today in court

Deputy United States Marshal
Southern District of New York

Due to Ghislaine Maxwell's enhanced security measures at MDC Brooklyn (which has been determined by BOP), the USMS must transport the prisoner before all other court productions for the day because her movement later in the day would lead to delays in other in-custody court productions that have been scheduled. The USMS does not provide additional clothing to prisoners when they are produced for Court. The clothing of prisoners transported from BOP are given to them by the facility; not the USMS. Lastly, the USMS does not provide prisoners with utensils for the food they come over from MDC with. The USMS does not provide prisoners with their lunches as the facility gives it to them without utensils. Usually, the lunch items prisoners have been given do not require the use of utensils.
