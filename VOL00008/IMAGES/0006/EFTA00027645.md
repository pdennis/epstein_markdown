Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for our fist witness in the Maxwell trial. He'll be flying in from California, so he'll need to travel to NY on 11/27 in order to meet with me on 11/28. I expect he'll testify on 11/29, but he could possible bleed over into 11/30 if we get tied up in jury selection issues, so I'd like to schedule his flight out of NY for the evening of 11/30. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you, as always, for your help.
