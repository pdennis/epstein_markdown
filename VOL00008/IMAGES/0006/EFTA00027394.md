Hi David and Sigrid,

We wanted to let you know about a recent order from Judge Nathan regarding Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which applies not only to counsel of record in a criminal case, but also to attorneys associated with a case, such as attorneys for witnesses. The order is attached, and the full text version of the local SDNY rules can be found on the court’s website. If you have any questions about the rule or the order, please let us know.

Thanks,
