Thanks again for your time yesterday in allowing me the opportunity to get up to speed with the Epstein matters.

I know you mentioned that there will be SDNY executive staff meetings on those matters today.

If either of you have a moment after those meetings have concluded to provide me with a quick update, that would be very much appreciated.

Thank you again,

Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge
