Most of this is pretty dumb, just running by you before declining on all.

One more if you can give guidance:

We were told

1. the representatives from SDNY also worked to debunk conspiracy theories, which the victims have encountered online, related to Epstein's jailhouse suicide in August.
2. prosecutors continue to battle wild speculation on how the 66-year-old Epstein died, along with rumors that he isn't dead at all.
3. "The U.S. Attorney's Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories—that he was killed, that he's still alive, there are people still talking about that. There are still people that think this was an absolute ruse and he's sitting pretty in another part of the world."
4. Prosecutors wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could be potential witnesses in that ongoing investigation

Hey,

A few things we chatted about:

1. If you can give a nod on any of this: Representatives from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office traveled to Florida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein's victims and their counsel. The staffers, who worked in the victim services unit, held a similar meeting in New York on Oct. 23.
2. Where do things stand with forfeiture with Epstein's assets?
3. Dawn's new email address?
4. ANYTHING that can be done about getting emails from you guys. I have given 2 email addresses and the only email I receive is the guidance email in the morning to one of my email accounts.

Thanks.
