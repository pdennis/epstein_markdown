I'm attaching the 302 for [redacted] from an interview on August 22, 2006. Do we have the notes? The last paragraph refers to her providing a copy of the hours she worked at Epstein's residence as well as some notes she made at her time of employment. Do we have those documents? I can also check with [redacted] – let me know please. Thanks!
