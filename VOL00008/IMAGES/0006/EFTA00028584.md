Dear Judge Nathan,

Attached is the Government's memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's supplemental pretrial motions. The Government is not seeking redactions to the memorandum. However, the electronic case filing system does not accept the filing of opposition briefs where the original motion does not appear on the docket, and the defense motion has not yet been publicly filed. The Government will promptly file its opposition on the public docket after the defense motion is filed.

Respectfully submitted,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
New York, NY 10007
