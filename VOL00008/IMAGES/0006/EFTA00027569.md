Good Morning,

I received a new set of data from (cc'd) for the Epstein matter. The cost for processing and uploading this data to Relativity will be approximately $8,000.00. The data should be ready to ship to PAE by Wednesday or Thursday. I wanted to know if I have your approval to send this data to the vendor.

Thank you.
