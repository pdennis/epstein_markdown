Thanks so much, . My apologies again for its length. I welcome all of your feedback, including where to trim this; if the order in which I addressed her various arguments makes sense; and the due process points. Hopefully I didn't miss the mark too badly on this! Thanks again.

Thanks again for all of your time over the past couple of weeks. I was hoping to send you my Maxwell opposition this afternoon for your review given all of your incredibly helpful feedback and expertise in this area. It’s on the lengthier side given the complicated facts and the many arguments they made so my apologies in advance. I’m aiming to send it to my chiefs early next week if at all possible, but totally understand if not. Happy to discuss.
