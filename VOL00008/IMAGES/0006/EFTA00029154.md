The Maxwell team has completed another round of review on Relativity. Would you please work with the vendor to get the following materials from the "Florida investigation FOIA files" folder in the "US v Epstein" database prepped for production as follows:

- The 298 documents tagged "Produce As Is" within the "Florida investigation FOIA files" folder need a bates number
- The 1,668 documents tagged "Produce As Confidential" within the "Florida investigation FOIA files" folder need a bates number and to be stamped CONFIDENTIAL
- The 2 documents tagged "Produce As Highly Confidential" within the "Florida investigation FOIA files" folder need a bates number and to be stamped HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

Please let me know if you have any questions, and thanks very much for your help.
