FYI- we discussed this over the summer but I guess he never submitted the request. I know you're no longer on the case but let me know who I should forward this to in the event I receive a copy of his request. Copying [REDACTED] for his awareness.

Hi Mr. [REDACTED]

As I discussed with Ms. [REDACTED] over the summer, you would need to submit a FOIA request to the BOP and note that you are specifically requesting what they released to the NYT. You can send me copy of that request once it has been submitted to the BOP and as a courtesy I will ensure that the correct recipient in the Civil Division of our Office has received it. We do not handle FOIA requests in our division.

Best,

Hi,

Hope this finds you well.

I would like to get a copy of ALL of the records that were released to the New York Times on their FOI request regarding my brother's case (Jeffrey Epstein).

Please advise the quickest way to accomplish this.

Thanks,

[REDACTED]
