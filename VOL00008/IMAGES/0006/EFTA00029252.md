Mark – Hope you had a good weekend and just wanted to circle back on this. Realizing it is starting to get a bit late in the day in London, would tomorrow morning (New York time) work for a follow up call on this? Perhaps around 10am our time/3pm in London? If so, we can circulate another dial in.

Thanks,

From: Mark Steward <mark.steward@fca.org.uk>

Hi [REDACTED]

I have spoken to Mark's business support and he is available at 4.15pm (UK time) today (ie in just under an hour's time). It is quite urgent so if we could speak then it would be greatly appreciated. If that does work please let us know what number to call you on?

Many thanks

Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks, Ted

Hi [REDACTED]

Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is handling ongoing work into Mr E's world?

Cheers
