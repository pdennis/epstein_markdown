Dear [Redacted],

Please excuse the informality but I am an old experienced civil trial attorney. Luckily, I never have represented any client in criminal matters.

[Redacted] just contacted my office and said that you dropped by her apartment. She was a former client. She would like to cooperate but I have my professional responsibility to make some inquiry about events that were so long ago.

Regarding the Epstein matter she is definitely a victim and I hope that you are aware of this fact.

That being said is she a target in any ongoing investigation?

Let me know and we can figure a good time to meet and potentially whether or not I am competent to represent her.

Thank you,

[Redacted]
