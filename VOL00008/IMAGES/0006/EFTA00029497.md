# EMAIL TO FILE:

During the course of reviewing my emails, as described in the Epstein Transition Memo dated October 9, 2020, I moved approximately 160 non-substantive (but arguably or clearly related to the case in some fashion) emails to a separate folder in Outlook. In the process of doing so, approximately 140 of those emails were duplicated. Today, I deleted the duplicate version of those emails, taking care to ensure that one copy of each email remains in that folder, consistent with the litigation hold in this case.

Do not believe there is a de-dupe option.

Sorry for the bother, but I copied a number of emails into a new Outlook folder and it somehow appears to have doubled every single email. Is there a way to update / de-dupe that? Or do I need to individually delete every other email to get it back to normal?? Thank you!
