Great. Since [REDACTED] and I are in different locations, I can circulate a dial in.

Thanks, [REDACTED]. Would 12pm tomorrow (Thursday) work for you? If not, we also have availability Friday morning, from 10-12:30 if anything in there works for you. Best, [REDACTED]

Hi [REDACTED],

I'm happy to assist you. I'm available Thursday or Friday to discuss what documents you are trying to locate. Please let me know if you have availability on either of those days.

Thanks, [REDACTED]

Thanks. OPR and [REDACTED] may have a better sense on document custodians than do I. [REDACTED].

Thanks, [REDACTED]. Among our questions was who, whether at ODAG, SDFL, or NDGA we should be in touch with at this point regarding documents. I also know OPR did a significant document collection last year.

We will reach back to OPR, but if there is a particular point of contact at SDFL or NDGA on issues related to document collection, in particular, please let us know. And if a call on those issues would be helpful, happy to set one up.

Thanks very much,

Happy to talk, but my only real role related to recusal issues and consequences. Now that the CVRA litigation is over, you probably are best going directly to SDFL, as I don't have any of their documents. Thanks, [REDACTED].

[REDACTED] – Hope all is well. We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential document/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were largely at mooted at the time by Epstein’s death, but as I’m sure you know, we’ve recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, anticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week for a quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you.

Thanks very much,
