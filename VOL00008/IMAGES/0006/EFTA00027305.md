Subject: Request re Maxwell Laptop

Date: Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:27:34 +0000

Hi _______________

Hope you're doing well. Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney has informed me that Maxwell is having difficulty reviewing the portions of her discovery that include audio recordings on the laptop my office provided for her use. The attorney seems to think that the issue can be fixed if someone from MDC's IT department could assist Maxwell in enabling the audio jack so that Maxwell can use headphones to listen to the recordings. Would it be possible to ask someone from IT to please look into this issue?

Thanks very much,
