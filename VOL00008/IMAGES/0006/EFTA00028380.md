Hey!

I searched Epstein's travel records from 6/1/2019 to 6/27/2019 at noon and attached the record. His last record shows an OUTBOUND flight on 6/14/2019 to Paris.

Search capabilities only show international travel and are limited if he travels to the islands because it is US Territory. It is unclear why some OUTBOUND/INFBOUND records show Epstein going to/from the islands and others don't but it is likely up to how CBP inputs their information.

Hope this helps!
