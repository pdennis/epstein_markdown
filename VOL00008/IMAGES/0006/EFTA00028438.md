Hi Gloria,

Do you have a sense yet of what time works for you and your client to come to our office tomorrow afternoon?

Thanks,

I understand. I will let you know as soon as I hear from [ ]. Also, I am open to having the meeting later than 1P.M., because I scheduled that time prior to knowing about the status conference in the morning. Let me see what [ ] wants to do and then we can discuss the where and when and will work for you.

Hi Gloria,

Thanks for letting us know about the possible meeting location change—please let us know once you've been able to confirm with your client, and we can let [ ] know so that she can cancel the car service.

Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

Thanks,

Thank you very much for this information. I plan to attend this court this status conference on Wednesday. I am concerned that the courtroom may be full and no seat will be available for me. Would you be kind enough to have someone on your staff save a seat for me? Also, since the courthouse is very close to your office I have emailed [redacted] to ask if she would be willing to meet at your office instead of at my hotel at 1P.M. Since her hotel is near to your office and near the courthouse and since I will be in the area now as well, if she feels comfortable meeting at your office instead of my hotel I am willing to meet at your office to save you and her the time to travel to my hotel. I will let you know when she responds.

Hi Gloria,

Yes—in this district, criminal defendants are present at all court conferences absent unusual circumstances.

I see that a status conference is scheduled for Mr. Epstein’s criminal case in court in New York at 11A.M. on Wednesday, July 31. Do you know if Mr. Epstein will be present for the status conference in court on Wednesday?
