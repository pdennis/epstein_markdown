On behalf of Roberta Kaplan</rharris@loeb.com></ecf@eplic.com>

Jordy,

Thank you for your email. We appreciate your commitment to a program that is independent of the Estate, which we also view as a central feature of any viable alternative to litigation. As I'm sure you can understand, however, a claims resolution program in which the three decision-makers were selected and hired by the Estate—and, we presume, are being paid by the Estate—cannot be said to be independent. In our view, there is a straightforward solution to this otherwise intractable problem: the program should add a fourth administrator, selected by plaintiffs, and require that all claims decisions are rendered unanimously.

We look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We suggest arranging a time to do so before the protocol is finalized, since it will be important to incorporate the input of an additional administrator into that process. We will, of course, also raise this with the Estate.

Thank you for your email. I hear your concerns and want to reiterate that this proposed Program is entirely voluntary and independent of the Estate. It in no way imposes a process or outcome on the victims, and will in no way be administered or controlled by the Estate. Those are signature features of the Program.

As I mentioned in my email last week, Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a claims protocol and plan to circulate it - in draft form - to you and your counterparts before the holidays, and welcome any input you may have at that time. We will provide ample time for you to review and respond to the draft protocol, and will be happy and available to discuss your comments before the protocol is finalized.

We look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,

Jordy

## On behalf of

Jordy,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We are writing back on behalf of (and copying) certain plaintiffs' counsel who appeared at an SDNY conference last week for sexual abuse survivors of Epstein. We intend no disrespect to you and your colleagues, but, candidly, we have serious concerns about the Estate's purported decision to impose a non-binding settlement process on our clients unilaterally. All of these women still struggle today because of the profound manipulation, objectification, and physical abuse to which Jeffrey Epstein subjected each of them. Regardless of your own significant experience and good intentions, the fact that the Estate chose an administrator without any participation, input, or consideration of our clients' views or wishes is disconcerting, particularly given the personal nature of the claims at issue.

We are, of course, interested above all in advancing our clients' interests. As you may know, at a status conference last week in the Southern District, Magistrate Judge Freeman instructed counsel for the Estate and counsel for plaintiffs to engage in good faith discussions about any proposed claim resolution program. We have already directed a request for information on the proposed program to Bennet Moskowitz, and look forward to his response and to a productive dialogue with counsel ahead of the Jan. 10, 2019 deadline set by the Magistrate for an update on the status of our negotiations. Assuming that our settlement discussions with Defendants progress, we look forward to working with you at the appropriate time to design an effective and appropriate settlement program.

Roberta,

As you know, I will be serving as co-Designer, along with Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros, and Administrator of the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. I wanted to reach out to you to introduce myself, as I understand that you represent victims who have asserted, or may assert, claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein or his Estate. I also wanted to reinforce the key guiding principles of the Program and give you a sense of timing in the near term.

This proposed Program is purely voluntary, non-adversarial and entirely independent of the Estate. The Estate will have no authority whatsoever to interfere with the administration of the Program or the evaluation of individual claims.

EFTA00027914

Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a proposed protocol - setting forth the proposed terms, conditions, and criteria that will govern the Program - and plan to circulate a draft protocol before the end of the year. We will be seeking your input at that time in whatever format you would like to provide it, through a meeting with us and/or written comments, before the protocol is finalized.

We look forward to serving these deserving victims.

Regards,
Jordy
