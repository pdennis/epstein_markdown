Subject: Disclosures for Robert Adams

Hey Chiefs:

We have our discovery deadline tomorrow in the Adams case. Nick and I have gone through the witness interviews and propose making the attached disclosures, which we'll incorporate into the discovery cover letter. We'd be grateful if you could take a look.

We've also checked in with the agents to get their views on these disclosures, and to make sure we are not missing anything.
