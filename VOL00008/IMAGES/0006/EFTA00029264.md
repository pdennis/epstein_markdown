Hi Andy/Jill,

We understand that Mr. Contreras is willing to meet with us in a proffer session, and that the proffer would be limited only to the information he has regarding Mr. Epstein's death. If so, when would be convenient to meet? Let us know if you'd like to discuss anything by phone. Thanks.

Hi Andy:

I’ve spoken with my wonderful former colleagues in SDNY who are handling the investigation, and who are cc’d here. I passed along the information you and Jill provided to us yesterday, and they will reach out to you directly to set up a proffer on this topic.

Thanks, and best,

Dear [redacted]:

This email concerns the investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein in the MCC. We realize that it is unlikely your office is involved, but we thought that we should inform the government of the following so you can take whatever action you believe is appropriate.

EFTA00029266

Jhonny Contreras was recently returned to the SHU in the MCC. At the time of Mr. Epstein’s death, it is my understanding that Mr. Contreras was housed in a cell on the same tier and across the hall from Mr. Epstein’s cell. Mr. Contreras did not see Mr. Epstein hang himself, but he would be willing to speak to investigators, in the presence of counsel, about his observations.

Please let us know if there is anything further we should do to follow-up.

Andy
