Still, some details about Doe’s lawsuit are raising eyebrows—in particular because the allegations seem to match up with at least one of Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.

If this complaint was filed by one of his co-conspirators, who “played an outsized role in Jeffrey Epstein’s devastating abuse of minors for over a decade and profited handsomely including owning a company affiliated with Epstein, it is a brazen abuse of our civil justice system,” said Sigrid McCawley, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP who represents multiple victims of Epstein. “But above all, it is a shameless act and a disgraceful insult to the real victims.”
