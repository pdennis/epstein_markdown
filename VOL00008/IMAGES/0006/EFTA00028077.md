As we know, Epstein’s Lawyers are going to claim that the NPR agreement prohibits your prosecution. I want to share some information with you regarding that issue. You are probably already aware of this, but I’d prefer that you learn about it twice instead of never being aware of this proof. At the state court plea hearing, Epstein’s counsel told the court that the NPR covered only the So Dist Of Fla. On the next page of the transcript the Judge messes it up a bit, but we know that when she said “they”, she meant the USAO of the So Dist of Fla, NOT the DOJ. I am forwarding to you the cover sheet and two relevant pages of the transcript, along with info re when and where his occurEd. If you have any questions about this, or any other way I can assist, you please call me PS - two of my clients have advised me that they have contacted the FBI.
