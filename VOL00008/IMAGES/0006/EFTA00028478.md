Hit send too soon. Most of my VOC stuff is on the 4th floor. Most of my MLOC stuff is electronic so there shouldn't be much to look through. When you are there happy to join on FT to help out.

Thanks very much. I should be in the office later this week and will swing by your office to look around and confirm there are no hard copy files.

I do not have anything saved locally.

I do not recall having hard files. I am working remotely, however, anyone is welcome to go into my office and look through my file cabinets to see if there is anything. But I do not recall having any hard files or anything original for that matter.

Thanks very much, [redacted]

To confirm, do you have any hard copy files or locally saved documents regarding the Epstein case? (I gather from your email that the answer is no, but want to double check.)

I moved all of my emails to the share drive (Date Range 11/30/18 – 4/8/20):

I also created a sub folder for emails with attachments. I excluded Westlaw emails and generally only included the last email in a chain. But again all emails are in the umbrella folder.

There are some early emails with a US Marshal regarding JE's international travel and registration from when I was digging into any potential violations of the International Megan's Law. Not sure if you guys were on those correspondence at the beginning so I wanted to highlight that for you.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Good luck and I hope that you are all well.

Hi

Hope you and your family are doing well! With apologies for bothering you: we're in discovery in the Maxwell case, and we wanted to double check with you to see if you have any materials we might need to review. More specifically, can you check to see whether you have any case materials at all (of any type) that are not on the shared (e.g. in emails, or saved locally)?

Thanks,
