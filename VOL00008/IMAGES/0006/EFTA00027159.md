ORDER

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court will schedule a trial date for the severed perjury counts after trial of the non-perjury counts is completed. Given that and in light of the representations in the Government's April 21, 2021 letter, see Dkt. No. 227, the Court intends to defer resolution of the pending motions to suppress (including resolution of the request for an evidentiary hearing) until after the trial on the non-perjury counts. If either side objects, counsel shall state the basis for any objection by letter on or before by 5pm on Thursday, April 22, 2021.

SO ORDERED.

Dated: April 21, 2021

New York, New York
