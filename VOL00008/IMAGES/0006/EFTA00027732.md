Without conceding that these materials constitute discoverable materials pursuant to Rule 16(a) or Jencks Act materials, the Government is producing the following materials out of an abundance of caution in order to assist with your trial preparation.

The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. The Government wishes to bring your attention to the following statements, which could constitute Brady material:

- Inmate-4 stated that on the night of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers performed “a few rounds that night” but Inmate-4 could not recall what time.
- Inmate-5 stated that Noel came by “around 10 to do the count” on the evening of August 9, 2019.
- Inmate-7 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers “did [a] count around 10ish but not after that.” Inmate-7 further stated that Inmate-7 was not really awake for the 3:00 a.m. count on August 10, 2019, “but hear[d] [the] gate open.”

- Inmate-11 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019 into the morning of August 10, 2019, the “last check was made sometime between 12:30Am – 1:00AM. The male black stayed by the door and the female black walked through the tier but did not walk all the way in.”

In addition, materials from Inmate-2 include a statement which could constitute Brady, however, the Court has directed the Government to withhold these materials from production due to pending ex parte litigation. The Government will produce these materials if and when the Court orders their production. Beyond the above materials, to date, the Government is unaware of any other Brady material regarding your client, but will provide timely disclosure if any such material comes to light. The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), and its progeny, to the extent it has not already been produced, in a timely manner prior to trial.

## II. Materials Not Disclosed

In addition to the materials identified above, the Government is in possession of additional records that are not discovery materials under Rule 16(a). Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, the Government is providing the following inventory of those materials that have not been produced:

- Financial records produced by Bank of America for accounts in the names of
- Financial records produced by Citibank for accounts in the names of
- Credit report records produced by Equifax in the names of
- Financial records produced by JPMorgan Chase Bank for accounts in the names of
- Financial records produced by Municipal Credit Union for accounts in the names of

## III. Disclosure by the Defendant

In light of your request for the foregoing discovery, the Government hereby requests reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant’s possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant’s possession or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial.

The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

We also wish to remind you that Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.3(a) requires you to provide the Government with written notice if the defendant intends to claim a defense of actual or believed exercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement or Federal intelligence agency at the time of the alleged crime.

The Government requests a response to our Rule 12.3 demand within the time period allowed by the Court for the filing of motions.

## IV. Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility

Please contact us at your earliest convenience concerning the possible disposition of this matter or any further discovery which you may request. This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to the Government’s initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty four weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court four weeks in advance of the trial.

Please be advised, however, that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not constitute a “formal offer” or a “plea offer,” as those terms are used in *Lafler v. Cooper*, 132 S.Ct. 1376 (2012); *Missouri v. Frye*, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012).

Very truly yours,
