Hello _________________.

PAE talked with their technical team and they have indicated that all of the 109,853 records in the below saved search are empty attachments of EMLX files that were provided and were extracted with an image placeholder indicating that the attachment could not be exported.

US v. Epstein (SW Returns) - Image for this documents is not exported - https://d1pe.nss.pae.com/Relativity/go?id=2370462-4350982

The majority of the parent documents have "partial" in the file name. The 109,853 records with the image slip sheet stating that the image for this documents is not exported appear to be data where there were certain attachments that were not captured by the data custodian.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.
