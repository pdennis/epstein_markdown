&gt;&gt; Gents,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The following is a brief update as it relates to the Epstein Autopsy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ligature marks around the neck, petechia hemorrhage in the eyes, fractured hyoid bone-All the injuries noted are consistent with the circumstances surrounding the death.
&gt;&gt; Deep tissue bleeding to left shoulder/scapula area, which is believed to be caused from the position he hung himself.
&gt;&gt; Dr. Roman would not provide a Cause &amp; Manner of Death at this time and will be pending this case for additional studies (histology, neuropathology, toxicology)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In addition, the family hired private pathologist, Dr. Baden Michael, who was present for the autopsy. We will continue to track this case and advise of any new or significant developments.
