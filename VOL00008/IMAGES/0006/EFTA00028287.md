This isn't an immediate issue at all, but whenever you next talk to him, would you mind asking him which victims he's hearing from?? We haven't gotten any feedback from individual victims or counsel (either directly or through the agents) so I'm just curious who else the victims would be talking to that it would get back to [redacted], particularly if any of the info is substantive in any way. Thanks!

Guys,

Continue to hear positive comments coming from attendees of the meeting in Florida. FYSA, we are currently expecting 15 victims, 3 support persons, and 8 attorneys at the meeting here on the 23rd.
