I will continue to forward updates as I get them.

It is really quite extraordinary that our team was able to conduct an investigation of great sensitivity and public interest with complicated witnesses over a period of several months, resulting in an excellent indictment, and manage to keep it all entirely covert. It has been an effort requiring enormous sophistication, judgment and dedication, which is a testament to you all. And the case is a righteous one. Thank you all. Geoff

Good morning all—

asked me to pass along two quick updates. First, Judge Moses signed the search warrant this morning. Second, our case agent told us that FBI received a flight manifest from CBP last night. The passengers listed are Epstein and two pilots. Of course, that is subject to change, and I’m told that FBI will try to get confirmation of the passengers after the flight takes off.
