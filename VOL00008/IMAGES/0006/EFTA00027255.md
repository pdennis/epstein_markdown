Please see attached for your review. We tried to keep this as brief as possible while still accurately describing the contents of their file that we do not want disclosed, and the circumstances under which they were disclosed. Let us know if you have any thoughts. Our call is at 10 tomorrow morning and we'd like to send this after the fact. I also spoke with the GC by phone tonight to give her a head's up that this was coming, and she did not have any issues with it.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
