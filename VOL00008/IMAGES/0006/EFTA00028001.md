- Per your request:

Following Geoff's comments about Prince Andrew on January 27, the team heard from counsel for several witnesses who had seen Geoff's remarks and had concerns. Specifically, following the comments about Prince Andrew, the team heard from counsel for [redacted], each of whom sought to confirm that their own communications with the team about their clients would remain confidential. [redacted] and [redacted] – both of whom are believed to have worked in some capacity for Maxwell/Epstein during relevant time periods – have never been interviewed before but have expressed a willingness to come in, and the team has been working with their counsel to arrange for interviews (we have an interview on the calendar with [redacted] for February 28). [redacted] who also was an employee/assistant of Epstein's, who was ostensibly covered by the Florida NPA, and whose name has come up with some frequency during the investigation, had previously declined to be interviewed, but more recently her counsel has expressed a willingness to provide an attorney proffer as a first step toward a possible voluntary interview.
