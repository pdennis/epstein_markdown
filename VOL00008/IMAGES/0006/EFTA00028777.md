This looks great, thanks [redacted] and thanks especially for conforming it to what we posted in the Epstein case last year. I just made a few very small changes, and we should be good to go. Let's please post the following:

## July 16, 2019 update:

On July 14, 2019, an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing was held in the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the Superseding Indictment. The court announced its ruling that the defendant will be incarcerated pending trial. The Court scheduled discovery and motion deadlines for counsel as well as a trial date of July 12, 2021, before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Foley Square, New York, New York, in Courtroom 906. No next conference was scheduled at this appearance.

Separately, currently on the home page we have a box for the Epstein case, that's a link to the updates and also information on where to call with information. Could we please change that to the Maxwell case? So exact same language, just change the case heading to the one for Maxwell, above, and switch "Jeffrey Epstein" to "Ghislaine Maxwell" – so that if people just go to our main website, they can easily see where the updates are. Thank you!!

Should we be updating to the page to reflect yesterday's hearing and order? Let me know if this works:
