Best,

Blue sheets are fine, thanks. No need for tabs or labels or an index. Thanks for putting this together!

Hi

I just wanted to check with you and see whether you wanted tabs separating the different 302s or if blue sheets were fine, and also whether you wanted a table of contents at the beginning or not.

Thanks,

Hi

Thanks again for all your help getting the team ready for the focus group exercise this weekend. For this case, we have a witness coming in for trial prep this week.  is going to conduct a mock cross examination of her. In order to help him prep for that, could you please put together a binder of the 302s of her interviews?  can point you to the folder on the shared where all of that lives (things have been moving around a bit as we prep to produce 3500). The witness is  (that's her married name – she used to be  , so some documents are titled that way).

If you're able to get that to  by tomorrow morning, that would be great. Thanks!

Thanks!
