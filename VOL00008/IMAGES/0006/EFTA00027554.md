Hi

After Monday's bizarre and insulting appearance of Geoffrey Berman, please may I arrange a call with you all, at your earliest convenience.

&gt; Hi - as stated I thought since I haven't spoken to you before this would be a good opportunity. I also spoke to the case agent and thought we could call you together; to answer any questions that we are able about the case.

&gt;

&gt; Would you be free January 22? I'm thinking. Let me know if that would work for you. If so - let us know what time and a number to contact you at.

&gt;

&gt; Have a great weekend and looking forward to speaking with you.

&gt;

&gt; Good evening

&gt;

&gt; As promised, attached is a complete medical list that the provides for those seeking medical services.

&gt;

&gt; You will see in the document that there are psychological services listed on page 22.

&gt;

&gt; copied here, would like to go over this list with you and assist you in choosing a therapist. I will leave it to you two to connect at a time convenient for you both. You may even decide to see more than one doctor until you decide with whom you're comfortable.

&gt;

&gt; Thank you again for your patience this month.

&gt;

&gt; Have a great weekend!
