Hey team—

Spoke to this morning. No updates. She will call again today. is out for two weeks starting Friday, which limits the ability for approaches, and I asked them to consider an approach tomorrow, not sure if they'll be able to do that. Will let you know if I hear anything.

Go ahead and give them a call this morning if you want — I'll be in later but don't wait on me.

After a lot of back and forth, we’ve gotten the best contact number for [redacted], which was one of the ones on your list — it’s [redacted] (It’s our understanding that she’s not currently represented, though of course if she wants to have counsel, as with everyone else, she can obtain an attorney or we can also assist in getting her appointed counsel. And also similarly, we can jump on a call with her to explain the basics too if that’s helpful, but also happy to just have you guys make initial contact and then us meet her in person.)

So it’s fine to call her, and she should know that we have an investigation and that we were planning to be in touch, though as always we’re playing a game of telephone on our end so hard to know for sure. If you’re able to make contact with her, I think it would make sense to explain what’s happening generally but hopefully see if we can go out to California to meet with her sometime this month.

Happy to chat further if that’s useful, otherwise green light to give her a call.

thanks,
