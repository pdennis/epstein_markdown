[redacted] and [redacted].

My HQ has the following question on the underlying case, can you please forward this to the prosecutors on the underlying case? Thank you.

- In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein's phone calls related to the underlying case? If so, were they followed?
