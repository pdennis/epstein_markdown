We'll decline, but just FYI.

Dear [REDACTED].

We spoke earlier this week in relation to the Jeffrey Epstein case and you asked me to email if I had a specific enquiry.

I understand that a woman has recently made a report to the Metropolitan Police in London regarding a sexually assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein.

Could you please tell me whether the Metropolitan Police has informed the office of the US Attorney of the Southern District of New York and/or the FBI of this criminal complaint? When did the alleged assault take place and where? Is the FBI investigating this new complaint?

Yours sincerely,

Mark
