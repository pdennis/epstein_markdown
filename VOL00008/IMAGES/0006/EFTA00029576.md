Hi team - I've added and stamped notes from today (see attached). The TW Production and NTW Production 7 are up to date, and the updated index is also attached (and also saved here). Everything is ready for your review. Should these productions go out tonight? Thanks so much!

Hi team - the latest 3500 (TW Production and NTW 3500 Production 7) are organized and stamped on the shared. I know there will likely be additional 3500 to add today, and I will add those materials when I receive them. The current index is also attached for your reference. Thanks!

Because of the Daubert hearing tomorrow, we should get another production of 3500 out later today. Can you work on getting that organized, please? I expect we will have more notes from our meetings today.
