Geoff – As discussed, I’ve put together a short proposed statement responding to the press release issued by Prince Andrew’s counsel this morning. If we do issue something in response, as you’ll see, I would recommend we keep it short and forward looking, rather than trying to rehash all of the various factual inaccuracies in his account of the past.

Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely publicly portray himself as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, despite the fact that the Prince has never sat for an interview with federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and several months ago informed us unequivocally – through the very same counsel who issued today’s release -- that he would not come in for such an interview. If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with a federal investigation, our doors have always been open, and we await word of when we should expect him.
