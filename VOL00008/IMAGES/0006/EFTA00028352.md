Hi

My name is Ben Goggin, I'm writing a story for Business Insider about your participation in the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and wanted to ask you a few questions. I'll list them here but feel free to call me ( ).

*can you confirm that you are 30 years old?
*can you respond to criticisms that you have a conflict of interest due to your father, your past political donations, or your reported attendance of the women's march? Is the picture on this blog you?
*can you comment on your work at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP?
*can you elaborate on what happened in the 2016 case against the camp counselor who allegedly solicited nude photos from a middle schooler? Why did he plead to a lesser charge?

Thank you!

Best,

Benjamin Goggin
