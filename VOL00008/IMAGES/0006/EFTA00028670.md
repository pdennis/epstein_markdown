Here's a list of approved SPA vendors. My understanding is that Melken Solutions has handled sensitive work for USAO's in the past. As for all others, try calling them to see, with the exception of EXPEDIAIMAGING. Do not call EXPEDIAIMAGING! They have been banned from performing services for our office. I just couldn't delete them from the list.

I do not know what the NOC is.

EFTA00028670

I think they were just asking for recommendations for reputable vendors that we have used in the past. If there are two or three that we have had good experiences using, in Fort Lauderdale, Miami, or wherever, I can forward that contact information and leave the rest to them to sort out. Does that make sense?

Thanks for looking into this.

Currently, we do not have a contract in place for large/voluminous jobs. We use our Simplified Purchase Agreement (SPA) vendors for any job that can't be handled in-house. Normally, these SPA vendors don't have storage space in their facilities to hold discovery past a brief period, and the copy/scan jobs are small to medium. There are no restrictions for folks outside of our district on who they can use. If the request is being paid by another district, they are free to go wherever they like. To help with the process, I can try to find a few SPA vendors in the WPB area. Then SDNY can call them to ask if they can handle the job; about their security (confidentiality) protocol; and pricing information.

Another option may be to send the documents to the NOC. I don't know a lot about the process but we've used it in the past, and it's secure. If interested in this option, I can discuss with our in-house Graphics Dept.

Questions:

Is there a deadline of when the documents are to be scanned/copied?

Are the original or copied documents going to opposing counsel to review?

Will the vendor be required to store the documents to allow defense to view/copy?

Good Morning
I hope all is well.

The USAO – SDNY is requesting a list of vendors that we've used (I don't believe we have a current contract) for copying and scanning voluminous files/documents/cd's and cassette tapes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Obviously, confidentiality and sensitivity are major concerns.

I believe that SDNY will make the arrangements and pay for the services, but they are requesting a list of vendors that SDFL has used for these types of services. Since we do not have a current contract, is there policy that needs to be followed to use a company in this field?

If memory serves me, I don't believe any of the companies were local to West Palm Beach (where the documents are being stored). I believe the companies were in the Fort Lauderdale and Miami area.

Any information, assistance and guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and take care,

Office Manager, WPB
