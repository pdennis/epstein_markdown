Subject: Epstein FOIA Atty Visit Logs and Count Slips

Hi

Defense counsel in Tartaglione has requested to see the attorney visit logs and count slips that have Tartaglione's name on them. Those documents may be covered by the attached protective order, and so we have asked , who is firewall counsel in Tartaglione, to receive the documents from you for potential production to defense counsel (so that and I do not see them). is going to review the protective order first and determine whether she needs Judge Karas to modify the order to allow her to receive the documents, so please don't send them to until she reaches out. Thanks for helping with this - we know it is a pain.
