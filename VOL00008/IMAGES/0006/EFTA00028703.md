Hello _______________________________________________________________.

I wanted to know if you had time this week for a call as me and the vendor wanted to discuss a few items with you from our last call and give you something to review. It will be easier to discuss if we are all on the phone at the same time. Me and the vendor can be available either Wednesday or Friday of this week. Please let me know what works for you.

Thank you.
