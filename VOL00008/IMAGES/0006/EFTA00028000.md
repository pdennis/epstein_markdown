Thanks. I'm operating on the assumption this letter, too, may someday be made public, so I think the less we say about specifics, the better. I would also ask tomorrow morning what exactly they need, since they may not need more than a high level request (and I would make the request about returning the 302 by phone only unless they push for it in writing). Happy to discuss though if you disagree.

Please see attached for your review. We tried to keep this as brief as possible while still accurately describing the contents of their file that we do not want disclosed, and the circumstances under which they were disclosed. Let us know if you have any thoughts. Our call is at 10 tomorrow morning and we'd like to send this after the fact. I also spoke with the GC by phone tonight to give her a head's up that this was coming, and she did not have any issues with it.

Thanks,
