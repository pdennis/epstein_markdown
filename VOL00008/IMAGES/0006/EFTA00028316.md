Hi [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].

I am sure you are already looking at this but there is a real mystery as to how this guy acquired his wealth and its possible relationship with the charges thus far in the indictment. I already see significant tax evasion at the local and state level with the way in which the mansion was transferred to him back in 1996 (no record, no transfer taxes paid) as well as claiming the VI as his supposed primary residence. It would not surprise me that there is significant tax evasion at the federal level along with underlying criminality involved in the acquisition of the wealth in the first place.

Good luck with everything.

Best,

Rich
