Subject: US v. Maxwell - Request for Review Batches on Relativity

Hi Chris,

I hope you had a good weekend. The Maxwell team is now turning to review the SDFL documents that you helped get loaded onto Relativity. Would you please help us get those documents batched out for review? Specifically, please break down all of the documents in the folder entitled "USAO-SDFL Files" within the "US v Epstein" database into batches of approximately 500 documents.

Would you please also add an Issue Designation tag entitled "Relevant to NPA" to the preexisting Issue Designation tags?

Thanks very much,
