Thanks for this. We've provided some proposed edits to the focus group questionnaire in the attached. Please confirm these changes once you've had a chance to review.

I've also attached our proposed jury instructions and verdict sheet. We expect to have 8 attendees from the Government on Saturday.

Thanks,

Good morning—

You asked to see the Focus Group Questionnaire before the research exercise on Saturday.

It is attached for you to review and comment.

Please try to keep comments to a minimum.

I will need to hear back from you by tomorrow Noon, so I can finalize it before I leave for NYC on Thursday.

Thanks.
