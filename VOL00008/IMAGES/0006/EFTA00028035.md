Hi

Judge Nathan has given us 48 hours (i.e. until midnight tomorrow) to write a reply brief. Attached is a partial draft and their motion. Part I of their brief has a bunch on MV-4, especially at pp. 12-15 and 18. We respond primarily at pp. 10-11. Would you take a look and see if what we're saying is accurate?

Thanks!
