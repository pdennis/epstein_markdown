Dear Judge Nathan -

In preparing to file the reply brief pursuant to the Court's order (Dkt. 101), we noticed a typographical error in the reply memorandum.

We have spoken to the government and they have no objection to the defense making this revision (on pages 1 and 8) before filing the memorandum on the public docket. Accordingly, attached to this email are revised versions of the unredacted and redacted memorandum reflecting this change. We will file the revised redacted version on the docket today. We apologize for the error.

Regards,

Christian R Everdell
