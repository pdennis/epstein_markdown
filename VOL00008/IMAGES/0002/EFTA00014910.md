Thanks very much for passing this along. The permitted attorney contact on the list below only includes Vogelman without reference to her New York counsel. Would it be possible to add her two New York attorneys—Chris Everdell and Mark Cohen—to the list of people Maxwell can speak with on the phone, please?

Ideally, we would like to get them added today so that they can speak with their client over the weekend to facilitate our discussions with them about next steps in the case.

Thanks,
