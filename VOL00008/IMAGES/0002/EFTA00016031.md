Counsel,

Today, our team realized that a handful of documents from recent productions were inadvertently labeled with incorrect Bates numbers. Attached please find copies of those documents with corrected Bates numbers, as well as an accompanying cover letter. We are also sending a copy of these materials on a disc to the MDC for your client.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
