In an effort to reduce the number of things we'll have to scramble to do whenever the arrest occurs, there are a couple new saved docs in the share for whichever one of us ends up handling particular random things – in the Grand Jury / Indictment materials folder is an unsealing request and proposed order, since we'll want to do that immediately upon arrest.

Also, I created a new "Victim notification" folder and added a draft of what I think we should put up on a victim notification page on our website (like [redacted]), which we can add updates to as the case goes along. [redacted] can put that up when it's time.

Neither is any rush at the moment, obviously, but they're attached in case anybody wants to take a look and have any comments / corrections / edits so they're ready to go when necessary. And if either of you can think of anything else we should be doing now to save ourselves a few minutes down the road, say the word! Thx.
