Looking at the logs for Epstein's jet, I'm not seeing any flights to London the entire year that she was 17 (but if you could double check me on that, I'd appreciate it). Do you have Epstein's immigration records from the /90s? If so, could you please let me know if you see any record of him flying to/from London between March 1994 and March 1995?

Thanks—
