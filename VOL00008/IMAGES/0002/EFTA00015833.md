Hi,

EFTA00015833

Thanks for all your work on this project. I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things tomorrow:

- The [redacted] folder contains just one report, and I think that goes in the [redacted] folder instead. Please move it and delete his folder. Same thing for the [redacted] folder.
- [redacted] are the same person and the folders can be merged under the name [redacted]
- [redacted] is the same person as [redacted], a potential testifying witness. Could you please move those materials and delete the folder?
- The stuff in the [redacted] folder should actually go in the [redacted] folder, and you can delete the one for [redacted] once the stuff is moved over.
- In the [redacted] folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a new, NTW folder for him?
- [redacted] could you please move these to the not-a-witness folder you created? We'll deal with the contents later, but not in the context of the NTW production.

Thanks!
