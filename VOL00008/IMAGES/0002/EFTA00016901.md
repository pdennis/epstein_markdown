Hi [redacted],

Sorry I wasn't able to come by yesterday. Finishing everything up before a night trip always takes more time than expected, but I wanted to thank you both again for offering toet me review the report had I been able to find the time. I spoke to [redacted] and he wanted me to express his gratitude as well. If he needs to see the report while I'm away he'll let you know.

Happy holidays and see you next year!

Best,
