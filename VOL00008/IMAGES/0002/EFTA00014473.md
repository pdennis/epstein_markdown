I called her, you should not be receiving any more calls or emails. She refuses to call the tip line or the FBI office.

Hey ,

and I have gotten a few emails from Ms. Harriman since the indictment (for example, the below)—would it be possible for someone to respond to her and ask that she contact the FBI tip line with any information she believes she has about the case? Or I’m also happy to politely do that, but wasn’t sure if it’d be a bad idea to respond directly.

thanks,
