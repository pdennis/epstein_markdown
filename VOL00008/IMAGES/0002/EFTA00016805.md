Dear David,

The most interesting thing is what we will do with mioty and azure.

The mission in Alta Floresta was positive. And Jedi is done.

About something we will do not talk about, but you should know.

In order to give you an idea how 2 boys were planning to crash europe and the euro... maybe also dollars. It was a coincidence that I got in contact with this plan. Only due to my expertise in carbon market.

Alvaro Alves died in 28 november 2017. Strange. His case is under investigation by Letitia James.

As you see Mr. Goldscheider has also kinto.com, ukraine company ... Mr. Dmitry Firtash was working with him since some years. https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/479485.html

https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/before-campaigning-for-trump-manafort-plotted-to-rig-ukraine-telecoms-deal-leaked-emails-show

Maybe Mr. Trump could also be more intelligent and know that maybe...Mr. Goldscheider was only using him... to get equitablesolution done. He runs also rivada networks... https://www.rivada.com/#our-people

As we could avoid brexit - Mr. Merkel was working hardly on it (my friend Dominique Ristori was talking to her in march 2019)... the all project equitable solution has been put out of force, in october 2019, Mr. Anthonny Scaramucci (friend of Soros and Goldscheider) was trying also to impeach Trump.

As you saw in the investigations about Jeffrey Epstein, our mobiles are unsafe. https://www.mintpressnews.com/cia-israel-mossad-jeffrey-epstein-orwellian-nightmare/261692/

Betreff: introduction to Mr Peter Goldscheider, founding partner of EPIC Invest ( investment bank from Vienna, Austria, mainly focused on Eastern European investments and advisory )

Dear Mr. Jorge Costa e Silva,

As per our conversation yesterday, I would like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Goldscheider, founding partner of EPIC Invest, an investment bank/private equity group based in Vienna, Austria, that focus its investments in Eastern European countries.

Mr. Goldscheider* ( pls see his bio below) , is a prominent financier, and one of the largest players in past privatizations of Eastern European companies. Pls see the website for his investment bank , EPIC Invest.

http://www.epicinvest.com/about-epic/overview

A history of his past deals can be found under " references" in the website.

EFTA00016806

I mentioned to him about Mr. Carlos Sanchez investment in the pharmaceutical co. Galenika of Serbia, and he will be delighted to meet you and him, as EPIC has a very good team of professionals in Beograd.

Also, he has a very interesting investment in Montenegro (pls see presentation in PDF attached), that may fit Mr. Sanchez's investment goals.

Please see below a list of his other investment opportunities in the US, Croatia and Montenegro.

1. Information on Peter's major US investment can be found at www.rivada.com
2. Information on our Croatian tourism investment is available at www.valamar.com
3. Lastly, I am attaching a description of the Montenegrin high-end hospitality investment, which is to become Auberge Resorts' first venture into Europe. The particular appeal of this project lies in the team composition, which can be seen as a seal of quality, opening up the local market to an entirely new and high-end customer segment. Please find more information on Auberge at

https://aubergeresorts.com/

Montenegro disposes of the arguably most beautiful coastline in the region and has created investment conditions, which guarantee maximum protection to FDI. In addition to these generally favorable prerequisites to a successful investment we should also mention that the political backing has been ensured through extensive diplomatic exchange especially with the USA.
