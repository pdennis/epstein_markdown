I spoke with a representative from Amex in connection with the attached, and they said all Amex account numbers start with 37, but the Amex number you sent starts with 34. Do we have returns from that card currently, or is this an entirely new card request?

No problem either way, but I wanted to check since you said the closing date of the last statement was 12/18/19 so that made me think we might have some returns from that account already. Though looking at the returns we received from Amex previously, I don't see it. Please let us know? Thanks very much.
