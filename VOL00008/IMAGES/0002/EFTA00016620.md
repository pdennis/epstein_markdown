Counsel,

The Court ordered us to docket and propose redactions to the Dietz/Loftus briefing and the Court's Order. We are only proposing redactions to Exhibit 2 to your response, as attached.

Assuming you have no other redactions, we'll plan to file a cover letter and send our proposed redactions to the Court. You can then docket the redacted version of your response at your convenience today.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
