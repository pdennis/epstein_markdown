We can send you one similar to the USVI one but we are waiting on some info from [redacted] in terms of electronics processing clarification so were waiting for that before sending to you so it was a complete picture. But if you are ok with just the device and location seizure info we can go ahead and send that for now.

Let us know your preference.
