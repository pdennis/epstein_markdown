Subject: RE: Follow-up

Mr. Callahan,

Thank you for your email, and for speaking with me yesterday. As we discussed, we're not able to talk about hypothetical representations, but to the extent you ultimately represent anyone who may have information in connection with our ongoing investigation, please feel free to give us a call if/when that happens.

Best regards,

Re: Epstein Matter

Confirming our tel-conference of yesterday and the Subject discussed, I expect it will take 3-4 weeks for me to engage in discussions with Subject or his representative.

Thank you,
