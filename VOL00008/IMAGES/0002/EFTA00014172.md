Hi Barry – The Non-Prosecution Agreement contains a confidentiality provision that requires us to inform Mr. Epstein’s counsel before making any disclosure – even a compulsory disclosure. I am cc’ing you on a letter to Jay Lefkowitz, Roy Black, and Jack Goldberger informing them of the request and asking them, as parties to the criminal case, to contact you regarding a possible suit by the Shiny Sheet.

On another note, I also will be informing them that I believe that they still have not filed the complete agreement with the Court, as required by the Judge at the hearing.

Thank you very much for reaching out to us when you received this request, and if you need any help from us, please let us know.
