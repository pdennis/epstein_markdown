All,

In response to your request for any statements made by Mr. Tartaglione during interviews at the MCC related to the investigation into an event involving Jeffrey Epstein on or about July 23, 2019, we are producing to you a zip folder with reports of those statements. The zip folder also contains reports of statements attributed to Mr. Tartaglione that were conveyed to MCC staff by Mr. Epstein. These materials have been marked "sensitive" pursuant to the protective order in this case and should be treated accordingly.

In response to your additional request for "all the reports and video regarding Mr. Epstein's attempted suicide on July 22-23rd," we do not believe these materials are relevant to this case or covered under Rule 16, and therefore will not be producing them. If you would like to discuss further, please give us a call.

Thank you.

In addition to the statements attributed to Mr. Tartaglione we are asking did for all the reports and Video regarding Epstein’s attempted suicide on July 22-23rd.

I believe we sent a letter to the MCC shortly after the event asking that the video be preserved.

Hi Bruce,

Pursuant to FOIA/Privacy Act and Touhy regulations, we need a release from the inmate, Touhy letter, and subpoena for the request to be considered locally. Please also be advised that we would have to seek authority under Touhy through the USAO.

Thank you,

It is my understanding that Mr. Tartaglione was interviewed by members of Bureau of Prisons in the late hours of July 22nd or the early hours of July 23, 2019 concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s reported attempted suicide attempt. Please provide the record of any statements made by Mr. Tartaglione, any written statements made by Mr. Tartaglione and any recording of any such statements.
