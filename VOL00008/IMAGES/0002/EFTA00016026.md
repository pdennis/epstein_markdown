Thanks, . I wanted to confirm that this link contains the current extradition act: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41. I know you had sent a PDF of the act, but given the volume of the document, I wanted to include a link instead should the Court choose to take a look. We will let you know if we have any additional questions as we are finalizing the document. Thanks again for all of your help – we really appreciate it.

Best,

Here is the feedback from the Crown Prosecution Service. As noted, a consent in the US would not be binding on a court in the UK. (I can pull the relevant Extradition Act provisions cited below) While I suggested in our call this is like the kind of colloquy necessary for a guilty plea, I am reminded that consent to extradited is irrevocable and not appealable – no so with a plea.

I will try to write something up today, but my DOJ computer has been acting up.

Dear all

The standard principle is that extradition should be sought only where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. If a RP indicated a willingness to fully abide by conditions of bail etc then it would be a matter for the US authorities as to whether to accept those terms. If the RP returned to the UK but then reneged on the deal, then the failure to comply with such undertakings would inevitably lead to a Request for extradition and would be a factor on whether the person is detained on bail or in custody. If the RP was to offer a consent, the Judge in court would need to satisfy himself that the RP had received appropriate legal advice ( because it is irrevocable and there is no ground of appeal. The SSHD would then have 2 months to arrange the surrender. The only consent that matters is the one before the extradition judge in the UK and it will usually be determined at the initial hearing but can be offered at any time before the extradition hearing has concluded. There is no caselaw on this to my mind but the relevant statutory provisions are s 72 (7)(b) and 72(8) for full order, s74 (7)(b) and s74 (8) for provisional arrest and s127 and s128 on consent- irrevocable point/legal advice and sending of case to SSHD.

Hope this helps!

Dear

Thanks for your email.

I think the difficulty here is as you mention – the consent given to the US authorities would not be binding on the RP in the UK or on the UK court. Consent to extradition must be given irrevocably in writing to the UK court under s72 (8) Extradition Act 2003. In other words what the RP is offering in the US is a promise to consent before the UK court, which is unenforceable.

I hope that assists – I don’t have a case to hand. Anne-Marie returns tomorrow and may be able to add.

Regards

Subject: Extradition question

Dear Anne-Marie - I hope you are well. It has been too long since we have talked!

I have a UK extradition question which has been raised by a UK citz facing a US crime and currently being detained in the US. The defendant is seeking bail in the US and wants to execute a prophylactic "consent to be extradited" from the UK as proof that he is not a flight risk.

EFTA00016029

My understanding of UK law is that even if a defendant consents to be extradited, a UK judge still has to independently be satisfied that the extradition comports with UK law. So, for instance, if the defendant is released, flees to the UK, and then faces UK extradition, that consent may be evidence, but a UK judge would still have to decide on all factors potentially applicable at the time of the extradition. (The defendant may also claim that his prophylactic consent was coerced by his condition in the US.) Do I have that right? Is there a case or two which I can cite which stands for that proposition?

Many thanks!

Best,
