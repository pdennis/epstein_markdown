Thanks so much again for reviewing the photographs – we really appreciate it!! Our paralegal [REDACTED] put together the attached spreadsheet, which reflects a subset of the photographs you gave us from the photo review project. I believe it is 51 photographs in total. We would like to confirm for each photo on the spreadsheet from what disk or device the photo came from. Are you able to help with this? Can we find a few minutes to chat about this project?

Thanks!

Hi [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].

Hope everyone is doing well. Are you available for a call later this afternoon to discuss a game plan for the photo review project we've talked about?

Thanks so much,
