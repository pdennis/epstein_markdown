Subject: CONFIDENTIAL

[Redacted] please send a copy of the sealed Indictment of Mr. Epstein to this email address. I will maintain its confidentiality.

I would also request a copy of any Warrant that has or will be issued to search Mr. Epstein's residence or property and at the conclusion of any such search the Inventory/s. As I stated, he has been actively legally represented by myself and a number of other attorneys so to the extent there are any seizures of documents, electronic devices, computers, phones I would request again that there be no review of their contents until we can discuss meaningful ways to protect the privileged communications that such documents, devices, computers, phones would contain.

Thank you.
Marty
