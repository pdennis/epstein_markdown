Been a while since we last corresponded – we hope you're well, given the circumstances of the world. We wanted to reach out because we served a subpoena on Amazon on June 12, and we'd like to ask to expedite the response, at least as to shipping / delivery information for the relevant individual. The subpoena is attached for your reference, and it would be extraordinarily helpful if we could get at least that information by the end of the week (which is the deadline on the subpoena, though obviously we ordinarily are understanding of some additional time being necessary). Please let us know? And we're happy to discuss if that would be useful.

thanks,
