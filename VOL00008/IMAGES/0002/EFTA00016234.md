Dear , both I and my life partner are the sources of info. She is Madeleine Kristoffersson. Her tel # is , She lives in with me. Most of what we know about her is from personal knowledge. The rest is from social media. A great deal of social media was taken away right after she became controversial. They scrubbed the internet . Epstein was her "BBB" Man of the Year in 2002. He paid her $150,000 through two shell entities for her girls. We do not know the ages of the various women. We did not become familiar with the women. We ask for confidentiality for Madeleine. Madeleine , who is an opera singer, once sang for a BBB function. Enough social media, however, remains, and seems useful. We do not know all the sordid details, but we were never aware of any rules or age restrictions she imposed. I guess our point in contacting you was because we assumed that she is a person of interest and we know that she slipped into the US after hiding out in Stockholm. So we were trying to help before she went back out of reach to Stockholm. Sincerely, John Ray ps, we are sending along various photos of BBB girls , always teamed up with old men. , including Hazeltine. These photos we captured before Barbru cleansed them from the internet.

John,

Wanted to get back to you regarding your letter of March 9, 2020, which we received via the Eastern District U.S. Attorney's Office, and your follow-up call this week, both of which we appreciate. We did receive the letter, and in the first instance it would be helpful to know the name and contact info of the person who's the source of this information (assuming it is someone other than you) – we ordinarily pass this kind of information to the FBI for initial response, but it's not clear from the letter whom they would be in touch with to follow up. It would also be helpful to know, if you're aware, whether there is any allegation that the relevant interns were underage.

thanks very much,
