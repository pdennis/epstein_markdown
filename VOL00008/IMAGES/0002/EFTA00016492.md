Counsel,

This afternoon, we spoke with David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, counsel for _______________________________ about the articles you sent. David and Sigrid informed us that the reporting you flagged regarding _______________________________ is incorrect. _______________________________ has no intention of providing any press briefings during the upcoming trial, and her attorneys similarly have no intention of providing any such briefings or any other commentary to the press during trial. David and Sigrid both confirmed that they have complied and intend to continue complying with SDNY Local Rule 23.1.

Best,
