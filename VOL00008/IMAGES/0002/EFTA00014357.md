Good news. Another one of my clients who is an Epstein victim has agreed to fly to New York to meet with you on August 19 in the afternoon. Is that time period still available? If so what time would work for you? I do have her driver's license and I know she would like to fly with me on the Delta flight that I am taking on Sunday from L.A. to New York. If you will have time to meet with her your federal agent who handles travel may contact my assistant, Diane, tomorrow to arrange the details of my client's trip.

Unfortunately, at this point, she has decided that she does not wish to meet with you. I will let you know if she changes her mind. Thank you for having followed up on this matter.

Hi Gloria,

Hop you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on scheduling to see if August 19th at 2 p.m. still works to meet with you and your client at our office. We're happy to be flexible on timing if you need to make other arrangements.

Thanks,
