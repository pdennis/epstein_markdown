Good evening,

Attached for Judge Parker’s review please find an application for two warrants for cellphone location information. The application incorporates by reference an indictment that the Government intends to present to a grand jury in White Plains tomorrow and a corresponding arrest warrant. I have attached unsigned drafts of the indictment and arrest warrant for the Judge’s review, and will send signed copies upon completion of the presentation tomorrow morning.

The agent will be available to swear out the warrant as soon as the indictment is returned, which we anticipate will take place at or around 11:30am tomorrow. I can be reached on my cellphone at [REDACTED] should any questions or concerns arise.

Respectfully submitted,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
