All the devices and media have been available through our CAIR system for over a year. I suggest you review through that system. I have already given several people access to those machines. I can add more as needed. All the additional exports with the exception of 6 machines have been completed and can be shipped over to Southern tomorrow. I'll be available in the afternoon after I get back from the Bronx where ill be getting some information off some of the evidence that was already checked back in and is now in storage. If any of this needs clarification, please feel free to call my cell so we can discuss.

Stephen — [REDACTED] is copied on this and will be your POC for this week since [REDACTED] is OCONUS.
Can you pls let us know your progress on these devices and how our folks can review them? Also, how many devices are we looking at that will need to be reviewed by us? We are trying to set up resources to get through them ASAP. SDNY has agreed to review some and we will review the remaining balance.

[REDACTED] may have a few additional questions for you as well. She will reach out.

Thanks

Good talking to you today [REDACTED] is getting 3 - 2TB External HDs today and will leave them on [REDACTED] desk. [REDACTED] will Email everyone when they are there for him. If you don't need the 3rd drive you can send it back to us.

On a rolling basis, can [REDACTED] let [REDACTED] know when the HDs are done so we can alert SDNY and coordinate getting them over there. Given the attention this case is getting from EM we want to ensure there are no delays/issues. [REDACTED] is OCONUS next week on this case so pls copy me on any update [REDACTED] has.

Appreciate everyone's help on this as usual.

Call or email with any questions
