Hope you're doing well. I am having a good time although I miss you and the Office, and I am still trying to figure out what to do with my brunches now that Heights Café / Giulia's is for-real gone.

I have a special request. I am a massive fan, having done the retrial with her back in the day. And my partner and former Office guy is one of her mentors and counts himself a massive fan also. We weren't able to be there for the opening yesterday. We'd love a transcript. Can you get us one?

Thanks,
m
