Well I suppose I will not be seeing

How are you?... I suppose you
are making the most of the
opportunity to read... and observe
human behavior under duress and
confinement! If there is anyone
who would maximize on such a
"vacation" it's you!
I am with _________________________ and he
is asking if you would like him to
send you some Vaseline!

Seriously though sweetheart, If I
can do anything let me know. I
hope you are keeping a diary...

... and I am sure you are keeping
fit!
