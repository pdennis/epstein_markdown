Hello,

I have attached several articles of mine that provide a sense of my research findings, especially on long-term memory for child sexual abuse experiences. I selected publications that are fairly "quick reads." I hope you find them of interest. I can follow this up with my vita and some associated information later tonight. Thank you, and Happy Thanksgiving!

Sincerely,
Gail Goodman
Distinguished Professor

Dr. Goodman,

My colleagues, [redacted], [redacted], and I are the prosecutors in the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial beginning on November 29, 2021 in the Southern District of New York. We are reaching out because we would be interested in speaking with you about consulting with us and potentially testifying at the trial. Would it be possible to schedule a call to discuss?

Thanks very much,
