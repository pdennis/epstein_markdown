Counsel,

In this filing, you represent that you have made multiple “attempts to confer with the government” regarding particular photographs referenced in our May 6, 2021 letter on this issue, and you further represent that those attempts “have gone unanswered for days.” Our team is not aware of any communications we have received from you attempting to confer about this particular issue between May 6, 2021 and May 12, 2021. Would you please either point us to the relevant communication, or correct this representation to the Court?

Thank you,

Subject: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Response to Government's Rule 17 Submission

Judge Nathan:

Attached please find Ms. Maxwell’s Letter Response to the government’s submission on the Rule 17 subpoena items 9-11, and Exhibits A and B.

Because Exhibit B was a document marked “Confidential” by the government pursuant to the Protective Order, we are compelled to file this under seal, pending any contrary order by the Court. We are prepared to file the Letter Response and Exhibits on the public docket at the Court’s direction.

Respectfully submitted,

EFTA00014669
