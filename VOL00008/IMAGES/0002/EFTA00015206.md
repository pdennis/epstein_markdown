Hi

Thank you so much for dropping off the image and video files from the Epstein devices earlier today. I've looked through all the drives, and it appears that the folders for device number NYC024342 are empty. Is it right that there were no images or videos extracted from that device?

And I believe we are still waiting on images and videos from the below devices (but please let me know if I'm wrong):

|  NYC024328  |
| --- |
|  NYC024329  |
|  NYC024329  |
|  NYC024353  |
|  NYC024365  |
|  NYC024366  |
|  NYC024371  |
|  NYC024383  |

Thanks very much,
