FYI – we’ll decline on this. Doubtful there’s guidance, but let me now if you have any. Thanks.

Subject: Reporter question on Jeffrey Epstein

Hi _______________________________.

Hope you’re doing well! I’m a reporter with The Daily Beast and have been covering Jeffrey Epstein.

Today, attorneys for Mr. Epstein’s victims said Mr. Epstein sexually abused a young woman while he was out on work release in 2008-09.

Here is our story. Would love to get your insight: https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-abused-victims-while-serving-time-in-florida-lawyer-brad-edwards-says

Would you be able to comment on this? Did SDNY hear any complaints about Mr. Epstein’s activities while on work release? Could this perhaps factor into the case—especially as Mr. Epstein’s legal team is trying to get him out on bail?

Alternately, could you provide any comment on background?

Please drop me a line or give me a call. My cell is _______________________________.

Thanks so much!
