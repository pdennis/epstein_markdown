I apologize, but we've been advised that due to a scheduling issue the office leadership is able to do Friday, January 24, at 3:30 p.m. (rather than Thursday). We've also asked to convey that the leadership will block out at least a full hour, should you want that much time, with the potential for a short amount of additional time if necessary for questions, follow-up, etc. But they wanted to make sure to provide at least that amount of time, which is possible on Friday (but not Thursday).

Could you please confirm, and we'll finalize it on the various calendars?

Thanks very much,

Thanks very much. We've confirmed with our office leadership that they are able to do Thursday, January 23 at 4:00 p.m.

You should also feel very free, though not obligated, to submit in advance any written materials you believe would be useful. We will pass up the chain anything you convey, written or oral, in between now and the meeting -- and as we mentioned previously, we would be happy to (and hope to) speak with you again in advance of the meeting, particularly about the topics I mentioned in my email from yesterday (the incident described in the complaint, as well as Ms. [redacted] recollection, if any, of other instances in which she observed Epstein engaged in any sexual activity, or observed other women or girls in sexually-suggestive circumstances), but also about anything else you think could be helpful.

thank you,

Please let us know what days and time ranges would be even conceivably possible next week, and also if your schedule changes at for later this week. On our end, we need to coordinate at least 10 people's schedules so we'll need some ranges to make sure everyone who you will want to hear your presentation can attend.

As we mentioned on the phone, there is a strong view that there are offenses that can be charged now, so it is also possible to have this discussion post-charge, but we certainly would prefer to have the conversation before that, and while the issues are very fresh in everyone's minds here. Our supervisor's view is that the 30th/31st is a long way off.

thanks,

Understood. This week doesn't work at all. The 21st and 22nd also don't work, but if the 30th and 31st don't work on your end, I will see if I can move some things around in order to make next week work.

We were asked to inquire regarding your availability later this week (15th to 17th) and early next (21st and 22nd), and I know the brass feels that the issues are teed up and they want to provide an opportunity to hear from you as soon as possible. Are you available on any of those days, of it not, some other time next week?

Subject: RE: [REDACTED] - Following up re proffers

As we flagged for you a week ago, and as expected, we had a meeting with the office leadership today to discuss the status of the case in general and Ms. [REDACTED] in particular. We continue to believe that it would be helpful to receive any clarifications, as well as any response to the complaint originally sent on December 4, as soon as possible; we are available tomorrow or over the weekend if there is a time that works for you. If it remains impossible to talk before Tuesday, we have 2:30 in our calendar for then, but with a hard stop at 3:30 so please let us know if you'd like to start the discussion earlier if you expect it might be useful to have additional time.

More generally, you had requested the opportunity to present to the ultimate decision-makers in the case if it appeared that charges were likely, and based on our meeting today, the Office would like to provide you that opportunity. If you could please let us know what dates and times you are available in the ranges of January 15-17 and 21-22, we will figure out a time when all the relevant supervisors here are available. I expect that meeting will include at least the U.S. Attorney, the Deputy U.S. Attorney [REDACTED], and the Chief of the Criminal Division [REDACTED], and some combination of the Chief Counsel [REDACTED], the Counsel ([REDACTED]), the two Public Corruption Unit chiefs ([REDACTED]), the line assistants, and/or FBI investigative and supervisory personnel. We will be prepared to discuss that meeting with you via phone when we speak as well, which is one reason I note that we can begin our discussion earlier than 2:30 on Tuesday (or block off significant time to talk before then) if that would be useful.

thank you,

Sorry for the delay in my response. Unfortunately, I won't be able to address this until my return to the office. Apologies. Of course, I will consult with [REDACTED] and try to get back to you as quickly as possible following my return. In anticipation of being able to do that, do you want to "pencil in" a call for Tuesday, January 14 at 2:30?

Thanks very much for being in touch. We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week we'll be having meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward for aspects of the case including Ms. [redacted]. In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you were prepared (and willing) to convey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in the complaint [redacted] sent on December 4 (re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you have additional information that would be helpful to convey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the coming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come back, obviously we understand the challenges of scheduling, but we had anticipated trying to see if we could schedule a call in the coming days. Please let us know?

thanks,

All – Happy new year. Wishing you and your families a happy, healthy, and peaceful 2020. We wanted to let you know that there are a few minor clarifications/corrections we want to share with respect to [ ] proffers. I will be out of the country and not returning to the office until January 10<x-apple-data-detectors: !="" 0=""> (or possibly January 13<x-apple-data-detectors: !="">). We will contact you then about scheduling a call to discuss. Many thanks.
