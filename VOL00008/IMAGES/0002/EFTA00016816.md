Just wanted to circle back on this – ☐, are you signed off? Is this something we could get over to Part I today or tomorrow? Thanks

☐, is it the intent to share those? If so, I’ll just add it to every mention of each document, but if not then it’s unnecessary. I don’t think those are substantive docs but I defer.

Please add it in the right place and send me the order. Remember, I’m not a T&amp;E lawyer. But you are getting to be

Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we’ve received, with just a note that it doesn’t appear to include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

thanks,

☐ – I’ve updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now received. Would you take a look when you can?

■ – I’ve tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I’ve accurately described/characterized the new stuff we’re looking to share?

Thanks,
