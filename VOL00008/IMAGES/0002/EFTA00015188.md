Good afternoon,

I'm writing to request certification of the attached AT&amp;T record. I have also attached a cover letter that is attached to the CD containing the record. The CD itself has a file code of 229703 and a date of 8/23/2006.

If you have any questions, or if you have difficulty certifying the record, please give me a call at the below number.

Thank you,

Andrew
