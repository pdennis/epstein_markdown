&gt;&gt; Hi

I hope you are enjoying the holiday season. When you have a moment, could we please get on a call to discuss the below email from Maxwell’s counsel? Understanding that we are still in the middle of the holidays, maybe we can find a time early next week for a call.

Thanks.

Good evening.

We hope you and your family had a joyful holiday.

In response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the laptop, in lieu of the MDC computer, during the typical length of time other inmates are permitted out of their cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to 10:30 pm on weekends.)

The voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop.

EFTA00015908

The MDC computer turns off every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery may be too taxing for the operating system.

We also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions and restrictions.

The constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current shift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening.

Ms. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell to accommodate capture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small confinement area.

Her use of the laptop has been restricted.

She is invasively surveilled while showering.

Her cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls.

Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was removed leaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold.

The blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel.

The open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, with more frequently than other inmates are searched. Her cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her legal work and an invasion into her privileged work product.

She has not received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail (return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week.

We will keep you apprised of our concerns.

Your assistance is appreciated.

Best-

Bobbi
