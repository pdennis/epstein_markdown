Gary,

Our understanding is that U.S. Attorney Berman made a factual statement in response to a specific question that suggested the Duke of York either would or was cooperating, and he responded that to date he has not in fact provided cooperation with our investigation. That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate statement; I don't believe this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your client has a desire to cooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to whether he is in fact willing to speak with us.

Regards,

From: Gary Bloxsome

The press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has disclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].

It has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the Southern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to do so.

We are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to advise the Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation. Please confirm that the DOJ will not be making any further public statements on this topic.

Thank you.

We are very grateful for your offer of assistance. At present we do not believe you can help us but we would welcome a real-time conversation once we have achieved some of the more immediate preliminary tasks, including the need to gather information from the Royal Household and others.

Gary,

Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to handle further processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would be grateful for some understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we may be able to assist in their resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation would be more conducive to that discussion.

thank you,

Thank you for your email. The Duke of York has made it clear to us that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ.

It is our responsibility to deal with the various issues and procedures that arise here that will need to be addressed to enable him to do so. We should be able to deal with at least some of the minor preliminary issues in the next two weeks and we will update you on our progress once we have done so.

Regards,

Gary

Gary,

We write to follow up on our phone conversation of a week ago. Could you please advise regarding status, in particular the initial question, separate from any logistics, of whether you expect your client will be willing to speak with us? And of course please let us know if any additional information would be useful to you.

thank you,

Gary,

We are available for a preliminary call this Friday, January 10. If it would be convenient for you, we are available at 9:00 local time for us (which I believe would be 14:00 your time). If that works, we can plan to call you at your office line unless you'd prefer we use another number or a conference line.

Mr. Bloosome,

Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date.

Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance.

Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch.

Regards,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
