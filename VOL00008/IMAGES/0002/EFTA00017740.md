Oh, sorry: our FOIA Tracking Database is designed to cover FOIA requests that are directed to our Office; it does not track FOIA requests to, e.g., the FBI, that end up in litigation in the SDNY and that our Civ Div defends.

Thanks, [redacted] could you please check your records and let us know if there are any other cases? From [redacted]s list, it seems like at least one case is missing (there is a civil case involving a FOIA request from Radar Online).

As we just discussed:

Here is what we have in our FOIA tracking database regarding Epstein FOIAs.

And also attached is the letter in PPI about discovery vs FOIA (see p. 8)

Hi ,

Hope you're doing well. Maurene and Lara and I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. suggested that you'd be the best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information:

- A list of all FOIA requests our office has received;
- For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and
- Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is.

That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

Thanks very much,
