Marty,

I'm sorry about that – I did email the two MCC counsel for whom I have contact information about 40 minutes ago, but didn't hear back. In any event, we'll be in touch tomorrow.

thanks

Marty,

Following up briefly on our earlier conversation, I wanted to advise you that we expect to be able to unseal the indictment and have the case assigned to a district judge at approximately 9:15 a.m. tomorrow morning, after which we can email and/or call you, or anyone you'd prefer we reach out to at that time.

Separately, I may have conveyed this previously, but in case not, please feel free to call my cell anytime tonight (or early tomorrow morning) if it would be useful to speak after you've met with Mr. Epstein—there's no time too late or too early to call, I'll be up. Particularly if you expect not to make a bail argument tomorrow, but rather consent to detention without prejudice to make an application in the coming days—we would just want to let the judge know that early tomorrow, if possible, if that's how you prefer to proceed. Certainly understand if not, of course, but just to mention it. In any event, my cell is

Thank you, and talk soon.

Marty,

I hadn't seen your email from a few minutes ago, I think they crossed – while I go by my email is ut now you have all the correct contact info.

With respect to the search, we'll follow up with you regarding the warrant – I believe a copy of the warrant and an inventory either has been or will be (at the conclusion of the search) be delivered on site – but we are cognizant of potential privilege issues and we appreciate you bring them to our attention as well.

thank you,

Mr. Weinberg,

Following up on our phone conversation this evening, attached please find the Indictment returned by the grand jury against Mr. Epstein, who we understand you represent in connection with this case for current purposes. As discussed, we expect that Mr. Epstein will be presented on Monday at the U.S. District Court at 500 Pearl Street – he will be interviewed by Pretrial Services and then presented before either the duty magistrate judge or the district judge who is assigned, which we also expect to occur on Monday.

As we discussed, the Indictment is attached. As we also discussed, the following is contact information for the AUSAs involved in this case:
