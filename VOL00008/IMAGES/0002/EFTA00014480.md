FYI all, this was sent from chambers to defense counsel a short while ago. The relevant provision of their letter reads:

Fifth, in response to the Court’s inquiry about Epstein’s New Mexico registration status, the state’s Public Safety Department formally advised in August 2010 that “you are not required to register with the State of New Mexico ... for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring Person Under 18 for Prostitution.” Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution and as an extra precaution, Epstein consistently notified the appropriate New Mexico official, Detective _________________, when he spent any time at his residence there. (The underlying documents are available upon request.)

Perhaps the issue of bail turns entirely upon whether the defendant notified New Mexico when he was in the state!
