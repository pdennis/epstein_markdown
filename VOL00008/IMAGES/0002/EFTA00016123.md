See below. I do not think we can justify seeking extended sealing at this point, but let me know if you all disagree. The warrant materials are attached for reference.

, do you need the seal on the DNH triggerfish warrant extended?

Merry Christmas to you and yours!

The seal on this triggerfish is set to expire soon.
Am I correct in assuming we can go ahead and let this lapse?
