Judge Gorenstein has reviewed the warrant materials. Please call him at 9:10 a.m. If there is no answer, please leave a callback number by voicemail or text and the Judge will respond to you shortly thereafter. If you need a different call-in time, please let us know. Additionally, Judge Gorenstein notes the following: "While it does not affect probable cause, the warrant application in paragraph 4 and Attachment A refers to Epstein being arrested on July 6, "2020." The AUSA may wish to send a new application that provides a correct date."
