I added some language to the text below. I don't think there is a need to include the document unless that is what we have been doing in this case. Thanks so much!

Hi Nick,

Judge Nathan issued the attached order regarding the teleconference set for tomorrow. Would you be able to update the victim website with this info, please? Some proposed language below.

The Court will hold a telephone conference to discuss jury selection matters on October 21, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. Members of the press and the public in the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling 844-721-

7237 and using access code 9991787. Those outside of the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 409-207-6951 and using the same access code. Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law. Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including monetary fines, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court.

Thanks very much,
