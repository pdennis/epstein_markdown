I thought we should set aside time after the team gets the indictment—the way we gather a team into [redacted] office for a pat on the back after a victory.

I want to say:

Congratulations. Great job,

This was a challenging case to make – to say the least.

The facts were old and there was that pesky thing called a statute of limitations.

You worked your way through that to a solution that should win the day,

You had the challenge of working with victim witnesses whose cooperation and trust you needed to secure.

You did that with empathy and genuine caring about them and at the same time a dedication to bringing the case against Maxwell that is indisputably a worthy case that should have been brought.

Your legal work was excellent as evidenced by your brilliant pros memos and well drafted indictment.

So I thank you and commend each of you individually and as a team.

If I could pass around a celebratory drink I would but instead I will simply ask you to raise a glass tonight with your significant other and know that I am also raising one at home for you at the same time.
