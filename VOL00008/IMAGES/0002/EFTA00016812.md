Subject: Epstein Trust Analysis

Hi everyone,

I've attached a summary/analysis of the Epstein trust documents we received. This document incorporates the analysis of the trusts from 2019 I did previously.

On the bottom, you'll see each trust has a tab and then further amendments to the trust (if any) go chronologically to the right. There's also key and summary tabs at the beginning of the document.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you'd like me to walk you through how to use the document, in case it isn't clear.

Thanks,

p.s. I wouldn't recommend printing the document, just due to the size of the excel tables.
