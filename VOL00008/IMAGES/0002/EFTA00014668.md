Hi Brendan,

Thanks again for discussing scheduling with me last week. As an update, the Court has issued a scheduling order for the trial (attached). Jury selection will occur during the week of November 15th, and the trial will begin on November 29th.

Thanks,

From: Quigley, Brendan &lt;;&gt;

Thanks for your call last week. Neither Mr. Rodgers nor I currently have any un-movable commitments between September and December. As I mentioned, I'm waiting for trial dates for 1-2 trials as courts open back up, so please let me know when the Maxwell trial gets scheduled.
