Subject: FW: Jeffrey Epstein -- Letter from Roy Black
Date: Wed, 09 Dec 2009 22:13:08 +0000
Importance: Normal
Attachments: Rothstein.pdf

Hi all – I have attached a letter I just received from Roy Black. The odd thing about this is that it is addressed directly to me. Roy (and Epstein’s team) always sends everything to Jeff or someone far more important than me.

I haven’t seen the Complaint against the Rothstein firm yet, but I did have a voicemail from Brad Edwards this morning, which I haven’t responded to.

Can someone fill me in on any developments? When I receive the criminal complaint I will send the copies out tomorrow.

Assistant U.S. Attorney
500 S. Australian Ave, Suite 400
West Palm Beach, FL 33401

From: Roy BLACK
Sent: Wednesday, December 09, 2009 5:01 PM

Subject: Jeffrey Epstein

Please see attached letter regarding Jeffrey Epstein. The original, with the attachment, should arrive via Federal Express tomorrow.
