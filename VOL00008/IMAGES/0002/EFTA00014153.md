&lt;<response for="" florida="" complaint="" bar="" v2.wpd="">&gt; Hi and -- I had hoped to finish this today, but two emergencies came up. I am running off to Court -- with my Blackberry so you can let me know if I can open my mouth.

I asked for an obtained an extension to file this response, so it isn't due until a week from Friday. I will finish it up tomorrow and get it to both of you and to . I only have a little bit left, so if you want to review the first 5 pages I would appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks.
