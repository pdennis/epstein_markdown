Hey Mandy-

Just spoke to , and he was wondering if you spoke to and if not if you could set up a call to get an update (You, me, and ).

The biggest thing he was asking about is what are the devices we will be reviewing (once it's split between us and SDNY), and once we know which devices to review if we can start on it right away.

I'll be at work for a few hours still if you want call me!
