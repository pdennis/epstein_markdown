and

I understand that Judge Engelmayer has so-ordered the dismissal of the Epstein/BOP FOIA case.
I know that this was a challenging and thankless matter.
Please allow me to thank you on behalf of the Office. The matter required close review of many documents --- with the judge was closely watching our every step.
You handled the matter with diligence and excellent judgment.
Thank you!!
