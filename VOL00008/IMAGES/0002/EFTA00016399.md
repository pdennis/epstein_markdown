I'm not going to respond to this one since [REDACTED] is sorting this out, but let me know if I have that wrong. Thanks guys.

Sincerely,

Hope you're doing well. This week is a bit tough for us. Are there dates next week that would work for you? We are traveling Monday through Wednesday, but could talk Thursday or Friday.

and I were hoping to schedule a follow up call with you concerning Epstein's New Mexico conduct and property sometime this week. We are both available tomorrow morning (9-12 MT / 11-2 ET) or Friday any time after 12pm MT / 2pm ET. Do you all have availability for a follow up call on either of these days?

Thanks,

We certainly can be in touch. I'm copying my colleagues on the case because I have a trial starting August 26 so I'll be mostly unavailable next week, but it should be possible to find a time for one or both of them to chat. If you send a couple possible times for next week we can figure it out.

thanks,

Would you have a couple of minutes to chat with me and one of my colleagues about some NM-related Epstein matters this afternoon or early next week? If today works for you, I am available any time after 1:30 MT/ 3:30 ET today. It is nothing urgent.

Thanks
