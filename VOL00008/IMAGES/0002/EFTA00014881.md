Thanks, they've been added, but lastly just wanted to check whether they should be marked with our confidential stamp or not, since they've been publicly filed?

Hi Alison,

I wanted to alert you to a recent development. [REDACTED] was recently served with a subpoena for a deposition in Melissa Selinger v. Kimera Labs, [REDACTED]. Alexander Jelinek (20-cv-24267). [REDACTED] ex-husband [REDACTED] is being sued by a former employee on several grounds including sex discrimination, battery and IIED. [REDACTED] is getting dragged in because they want to connect [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] actions while working for Epstein.

The depo was set for November 30. The Defendants filed a motion to quash (attached), which the court granted and stayed the depo. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to reconsider (attached), and the Court has ordered the Defendant to respond. The Plaintiffs have included a copy of the NPA, [REDACTED] depo and have made numerous factual allegations related to Epstein in their motion.

I’ll keep you updated as I learn more.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving,

Joe
