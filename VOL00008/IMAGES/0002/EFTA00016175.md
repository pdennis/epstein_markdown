☐ do you have a few minutes to talk this afternoon and, if so, what is the best number to reach you at?

Thanks,

BOP is prepared to house her at MDC Brooklyn as early as next week. Would you be able to notify the SDNY USMS accordingly?

Thank you,

It sounds like she will remain at a local USMS-contracted facility for the holiday weekend. The USMS contact who reached out to _____________________________. Let me know if you learn otherwise, and/or keep me apprised as plans develop in terms of where to situate here. Thanks, _____________________________.

Any chance of a USMS facility through the holiday weekend while BOP officials decide how best to place her?

Trying to figure that out. She is in a local facility in New Hampshire now, and will be presented virtually at 3:30. I would assume she would then have to go immediately to a BOP or at least USMS-contracted facility.

How soon do you expect her? With the holiday weekend quickly approaching, I would like to run things by my Regional Counsel as well as our General Counsel in DC.

Hi -

I hope you are doing well. I've recently taken on a new role as Counsel to the US Attorney. As you probably saw, Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested today in New Hampshire. We expect her to consent to detention pending her transport to SDNY. I was hoping to talk to the right person to ensure appropriate precautions are being taken for her safety, particularly given the history here. Would that be you, or is there someone else I should connect with?

Thanks so much,

Counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney
