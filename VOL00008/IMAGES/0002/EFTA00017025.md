It has been a couple of weeks since I got back &amp; I have gotten back into the selling of things. A couple of quick details about by I didn't mention earlier - went to see The Duchess - a decent play, &amp; Blue-Man group Tubes - off Broadway really cool production. Went to the Teamarket where I got some cool stuff, went to Jeffrey Epstein's Manson, went to the Met, a pretty fun New Year's Eve party, went to thrift stores where I got an amazing dress for promy it's from the fifties, lace with pink flowers w/ rhinestones in the middle all over it, it is my dream dress, one night we went to the movies w/ Jeffrey Epstein - It was a little weird one of those things that is overhauled to explain we were sitting next to calm other &amp; he put out his hand for me to hold &amp; we were holding hands (not weird normal &amp; fine) then he kind of caressed/helped my arm &amp; show/foot - It was one of those things that just gave me a weird telling but wasn't that weird &amp; probably normal - the one thing that kind of weirded me out about it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to - Overall I decided it was no big deal. It just made me mad because he is being so amazing - paying for a summer program for me - helping me w/ college - he is so nice &amp; so generous w/ everyone &amp; I just didn't want to have any weird feelings about it - I didn't/couldn't say anything.
