I should generally be around tomorrow, so feel free to try me anytime, or if it's easier to pick a time just let me know what's good for you. And happy to talk via phone, but if you have a list of the devices that you want to email, that's totally fine too.

Thanks again and talk soon.

Was in Greece last week, have to look at some notes to make an accurate response. I'll give you a call tomorrow. Any time best?

We got a significant batch of search warrant returns from you a few weeks ago, around January 13, and we expect to get access to it shortly but I don't think we know what's on it – that is, which devices specifically are in that batch. Could you please let us know?

And then separately, I just got a hard drive this past week with another set of materials – could you let us know which devices are on that one as well?

thanks very much,
