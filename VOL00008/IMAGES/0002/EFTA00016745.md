I'm headed into a verdict report and then a brass meeting, but can meet you briefly on 8 beforehand if you want.

Apropos of our conversation a few hours ago, I just got a call from  and  who have been retained to represent  , one of the former DOJ folks mentioned on the record yesterday by defense counsel as having been involved in reviewing the Epstein NPA. She is quite upset about the press coverage and is considering making a public statement. Would be interested in your thoughts if you have a few minutes to discuss.
