Dear

We viewed this as an ad, asking that the vendor to be considered to sell services to us and not requiring any response by DOJ or us. Therefore, we did not respond.

Please let me know if you have any questions or see any need for any follow up.

Regards,

Good afternoon!

I have been advised to forward you the attached correspondence from Arlan Ettinger, President of Guernsey's Auctioneers &amp; Brokers. The letter is regarding the property of the late Jeffrey Epstein. As advised by Nathaniel Gamble II from ODAG (see email attached), this has been assigned to USAO-SDNY for handling. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you very much in advance.
