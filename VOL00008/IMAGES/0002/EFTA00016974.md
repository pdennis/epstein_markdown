In case we don't have enough to do on the 22nd, I intend to raise several issues about the jail. In no particular order;

1. They are refusing to allow us to view the cells and common areas where Nick has been held for nearly 3 years. Initially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the staff. We are going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd.

2. I have written multiple emails to [redacted] asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July 23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all.

3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be hospitalized. We have not been given an update.

4. We asked for a family visit after next week’s court appearance and gave the same reasons we have been giving. This time we were asked for more detail. I sense a change in the mcc approach. My inclination is to ask the judge to help here.

I was hoping the new administration would improve the conditions while maintaining [redacted] responsiveness.
