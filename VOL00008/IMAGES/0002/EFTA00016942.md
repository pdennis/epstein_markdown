It turns out that Wednesday at 1:00 works on our end, which is great – so I’ll send a calendar invite now and we’ll be good to go. And just let me know if your acting (________ right?) ends up deciding to come too just so I can give my chiefs a heads up on that? Thanks again.

Our meeting with the brass just got scheduled for Thursday, so I’m checking with the unit chiefs about Wednesday, possibly at 1:00 – will circle back with you as soon as we hear from them. Thanks.

Following up on our conversation from Friday, our chiefs would be happy to do a general team meeting – are there times tomorrow morning and/or early Thursday that would work for all of you? I know it’s many schedules to work with, but we’ll figure out a good time and get it on the books and we can all do an overall discussion and update.

many thanks,
