Unfortunately information about the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein has leaked to the media while we were still in the process of trying to reach out to victims and their counsel, but I nevertheless wanted to reach out to you directly – could you please give me a call at your earliest convenience and I can let you know the current status, so you can pass it along to your client(s)? I'm reachable anytime day or night at .

thank you,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
