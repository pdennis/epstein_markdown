Perfect. Unless, of course, something else comes up between now and then . . . 😊

Sounds like you deserve a quick break – why don’t I come down in ten minutes, if that sounds alright?

Just freed up. I’m quickly eating something but could chew while we talk (or will be done shortly).

I'm going to make some calls so if I don't pick up when you call, that's why, but I'm here and will get off the phone and come down whenever you're available.

thanks,

No problem at all, and I'm very flexible tomorrow afternoon – whatever time is good for you I can make work, so just let me know and I'll put it in the calendar.

Totally understand, and next week would be fine – let me know if it's helpful to set a time, and otherwise I'll touch base midweek if we haven't connected by then.

And thanks very much re: the memo.

Already signed and sent upstairs ... I will do my best to ensure signature immediately.
Re: this afternoon: it may be best to kick it to next week. If some time develops before 3, I'll let you know, but right now it is iffy.

We dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you – we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA approval, but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ approval this afternoon. Thank you!

And separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if that's easier.

thanks again,
