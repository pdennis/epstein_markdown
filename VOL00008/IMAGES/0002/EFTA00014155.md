I have not. Your draft supplemental declaration (Nov 18, 2008) is fine. If you would sign and scan it, I will file everything on Monday. Thanks.

Hi all. Yet another of our favorite lawyers has filed the non-pros agrmt with the court. He filed it under seal and asked the court to unseal it.

- did you ever file the motn for summ judgment and my amended declaration?

I sent the notifications about the work release to all of the represented victims via their attorneys this afternoon.
