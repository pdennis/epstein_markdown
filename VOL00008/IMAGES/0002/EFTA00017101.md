Subject: Potential interview

I have another victim who is willing to speak to you while I'm in New York, as she is located in New York.

Attached here is her statement which I read in court.

Could you meet her on Thursday 9/12 at 5:00 pm at the Lotte, and then at 6 pm we can meet with ![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg) for as long as you need?

Please let me know so we can schedule.

Thank you.
