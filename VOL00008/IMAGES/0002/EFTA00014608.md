Tomorrow morning could you please burn the following folders to a disc:

\\Usa.doi.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\American Express

\\Usa.doi.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\Deutsche Bank

and put the disc in an envelope addressed to:

Special Agent
Detective

If it's possible to get the disc by 11:30, we'll give the disc to  at the conference, or if not, if you could put the envelope with security and reply all that it's ready, they can pick up when convenient.

thanks,
