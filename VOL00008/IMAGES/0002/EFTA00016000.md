Hello,

Writing to ask whether Britain's Prince Andrew will submit to questioning by U.S. investigators looking into Jeffrey Epstein's potential co-conspirators. The Telegraph reported this morning that the prince is preparing to do so.

Please let me know one way or the other if you can confirm. Thank you.
