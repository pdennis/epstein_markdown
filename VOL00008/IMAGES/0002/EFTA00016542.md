# UBS Client Relationship Agreement

## Introduction

At UBS, we understand that we succeed only when our clients succeed. With that in mind, we provide a customized approach to wealth management, built on your personal relationship with your Financial Advisor and shaped by an understanding of your needs and aspirations.

Known as the Client Relationship Agreement, this document outlines the terms and conditions of your relationship with us. By maintaining your Accounts at UBS, you agree to these terms and conditions and the other agreements and disclosures we refer to here. If signatures are required, please return the signed signature page in the enclosed envelope.

To confirm that our records are complete, we will send you a record of the information you give us after you open a new Account. Please review the Client Information and Account Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package and notify us promptly if there are any updates or corrections.

Please note: this Client Relationship Agreement applies to all of your accounts at UBS, including any Accounts you may already have with us and Accounts you may open in the future. You will not receive another copy of the Client Relationship Agreement or the Agreements and Disclosures unless there are updates and amendments, or if we require your signature on this Agreement when you open Accounts in another capacity. Some of the information in this document and the other agreements and disclosures we send you may not apply to you now. Please retain these documents for future reference because they contain important information if you decide to add services or open new Accounts.

The terms and conditions in this Client Relationship Agreement apply to all Accounts you open with UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico or any other introducing broker-dealer that has a clearing agreement with UBS Financial Services Inc. In addition, we will send you other agreements and disclosures for the UBS accounts and services you choose when you open your account, as well as features you may add in the future. We refer to all these documents, including any amendments, as the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

Your acceptance of your initial Client Relationship Agreement will serve as your agreement to the terms and conditions governing any new Accounts, features or services. Deposits of cash or securities and your continued use of your UBS Accounts constitute your agreement to all of the terms and conditions applicable to your Accounts. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions, you may cancel a feature or service or close your account.

As a UBS client, you may decide to open additional Accounts or take advantage of services and account features in the future. With some exceptions, you will be able to do so without signing additional documents or agreements. Upon approval of your accounts and services, we will confirm your requests in writing and provide any relevant agreements and disclosures you have not already received. Any authorization of features and services you give us will remain in effect until a reasonable time after you notify us to terminate the feature or service.

It is important to note that when we act as your broker-dealer, we do not enter into a fiduciary relationship with you, regardless of the fee structure you select. Except in special circumstances, we are not held to the same legal standards that apply when we have a fiduciary relationship with you, as we do when providing investment advisory services. We will effect transactions for your brokerage Accounts only as instructed by you, and neither UBS Financial Services Inc. nor your Financial Advisor will have any discretion over your Accounts.

"Accounts" refers to all securities accounts, brokerage accounts, margin accounts, deposit accounts or other accounts you open with us now or in the future.

We refer to the Client Relationship Agreement together with all other agreements and disclosures that we make available to you, and any amendments, as our "Agreement" with you.

We also refer to the "Completing Your Account Opening Process" package, which includes Signature Pages, optional forms and other required documents.

If a Signature Page is included, please have all named account holders sign the Signature Page and return it to us in the enclosed envelope.

This column contains important definitions applicable to our Agreement with you.

"You," "your" and "yours" refer to you as a client of UBS.

"UBS," "we," "us," "our" and "ours" refer to UBS Financial Services Inc. and unless we indicate otherwise, its successor firms, subsidiaries, correspondents and Affiliates, including its parent company, UBS AG.

*Affiliates* refers to UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico (which clears through UBS Financial Services Inc.), UBS Bank USA, UBS Credit Corp., UBS Trust Company, N.A. and their insurance agency affiliates and subsidiaries and all other subsidiaries and affiliates.

- You acknowledge that you will make an independent determination that any activity in the Account is suitable and appropriate for the beneficial owners and that the compensation we receive is reasonable.

# Fees and Charges

As a client of UBS, you agree to pay all fees and charges relating to your accounts for any transactions or services you receive from us, such as annual service fees, brokerage fees for securities transactions, fees for specific services you request and fees or charges by a third party that we incur in the course of providing services to you.

All fees and charges are subject to change at any time. Fees and charges will be charged to your accounts and may be satisfied, along with any other amounts you owe us, from free credit balances, margin and other assets in any of your accounts. We may sell assets in your Account to satisfy debit balances for any amounts due, including those resulting from unpaid fees and charges.

Please review and verify the information about you and your Accounts in the "Completing Your Account Opening Process" package. If you have questions, changes or corrections, call your Financial Advisor.

UBS Client Relationship Agreement

# Individual Retirement Accounts

The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and the IRA Disclosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement we will send you updated documents, and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions.

According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as the custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account. At your death, the beneficiary or beneficiaries whose name(s) are shown on the Account Information pages of the Completing Your New Account Process package will become entitled to your IRA.

Beneficiaries must be named in writing. Your written designation may apply to future accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation in the Completing Your Account Opening Process package. If you do not designate beneficiaries, or your beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the assets, your beneficiary with respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed of, will be your surviving spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. You may be charged a Custodial Account fee in connection with this IRA.

If this IRA account is funded via transfer from a non-UBS account, you represent that all transfers to this account originate from a same name inherited IRA of the same type indicated on this IRA Account Application (e.g., Traditional IRA, Roth IRA) and/or a direct rollover from a qualified plan which named you as beneficiary.

# Accounts with Cash Management Features

The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the terms and conditions that apply to the cash management features you may select. All requests to enroll in cash management features are subject to approval. We consider your continued use of your Account as your acceptance of the applicable terms and conditions.

There are important differences in the cash management features and other services that are available to U.S. residents through UBS accounts and those that are available to clients who reside outside the U.S. For example, we have different sweep programs for uninvested cash and different Card programs for these accounts. This agreement and the Agreements and Disclosures booklet describe which programs apply to which types of accounts.

Verbal Authorization to Upgrade or Add Cash Management Features to an Account

For any account you have with us now or may open in the future, we may accept verbal requests to upgrade or add cash management features to your Account. Generally, we permit any authorized person to provide verbal instructions to upgrade or add services to your Account unless you instruct us otherwise. In some circumstances, we may ask you or another person who is named on the account to sign additional documents or provide additional information for those additional features. We will provide you updated terms and conditions for the services you request if we have not already sent them to you or another owner of the Account. We consider your use of the Account as your acceptance of the applicable terms and conditions.

# Our Sweep Options and Your Sweep Election

As a service to you, we offer options for the automatic investment or deposit of available cash balances ("sweep") in your Accounts. Current Sweep Options include the UBS Bank Sweep Programs and the Sweep Funds. The available Sweep Options and their features, and the eligibility of an Account for a specific Sweep Option varies by the type of Account you open, the services you select, the type of entity you are and your country of residence. We may change or discontinue our sweep service at any time, including adding or discontinuing specific Sweep Options. We may establish criteria for Sweep Options offered to different clients, including, but not limited to, establishing minimum asset requirements for clients to qualify for specific Sweep Options.

You authorize and direct us to deposit or invest your available cash balances on each business day in your Sweep Option and to withdraw your funds from, or liquidate your

The features and fees of your IRA are fully described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

Please note: UBS does not extend margin for Individual Retirement Accounts.

Employers with a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA plan for their businesses must sign a separate plan document. We accept any approved plan documents, known as prototypes, whether they were produced by UBS, an IRS model or a document from another provider. If you would like to use a UBS prototype, please ask for a copy of the SEP IRA Plan or SIMPLE IRA Plan prototype document from your UBS Financial Advisor.

UBS offers a variety of accounts with cash management features, including the Resource Management Account® (RMA), Business Services Account BSA® (BSA) and International Resource Management Account® (IRMA®).

Cash management features available for eligible accounts include:
- Check writing
- Debit cards
- Credit cards

shares in your Sweep Option, as described in this section and in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, and any amendments.

Please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for a description of the eligibility requirements for the UBS Bank Sweep Programs. If your Account is not eligible for the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, you may select an available Sweep Fund as the Sweep Option for your Account.

For Accounts eligible for one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, unless you are eligible for and select an available tax-advantaged Sweep Fund, your Sweep Option will be one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs.

In general, most clients with a Resource Management Account® (RMA®), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), Basic Investment Account, Business Services Account® (BSA®), Coverdell Education Savings Account and certain Investment Advisory Accounts will be eligible for one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs. Eligibility is based primarily upon the type of client. Most non-business clients and employee benefit plans qualified under Section 401(a) or Section 403(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or under any other employee retirement or welfare plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (Plans) are eligible for the Deposit Program. In cases where a participant in a Plan has established a Securities Account for purposes of participation in the Plan (each a Plan Participant), the Plan Participant will be eligible for the Deposit Program. Most business clients are eligible for the Business Program.

## The UBS Bank Sweep Programs

Through each of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, available cash balances in each eligible Account are automatically deposited into deposit accounts at Bank USA up to the Bank USA Sweep Cap. Available cash balances in excess of the Bank USA Sweep Cap will be automatically swept without limit to your Secondary Sweep Option.

Unless you select an available Sweep Fund, the Secondary Sweep Option for eligible Accounts other than Investment Advisory Accounts is deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch. Investment Advisory Accounts will not sweep to the AG Stamford Branch; instead the Secondary Sweep Option for Investment Advisory Accounts will be an available Sweep Fund.

## Funds in deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch are not eligible for FDIC insurance or protection by SIPC.

Sweep Funds are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by a bank, are sold by prospectus only and may lose value.

Deposits held at Bank USA through the Business Program are subject to monthly withdrawal limits, as described in the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement. If your withdrawals in a month reach the limit, all funds on deposit through the Business Program will be withdrawn from Bank USA and transferred into your Secondary Sweep Option and available cash balances will sweep to your Secondary Sweep Option for the remainder of the month. These funds, up to the Bank USA Sweep Cap, will be transferred back to Bank USA on the first business day of the following month.

## FDIC Insurance Coverage and Limitations:

If you have more than one Account that sweeps to Bank USA, the amount deposited at Bank USA may exceed the amount covered by FDIC insurance (currently $250,000 per insurable capacity). You are responsible for monitoring the total amount of deposits that you have with Bank USA to determine the extent of FDIC deposit insurance coverage available to you. Please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for more detailed information regarding the UBS Bank Sweep Programs and FDIC insurance.

## Alternatives to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs

With the exception of tax-advantaged Accounts and Basic Investment Accounts, if you are eligible to participate in one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, but do not wish to have your available cash balances deposited with Bank USA, you may elect at any time to have

"Sweep Funds" refers to one or more of the UBS money market funds made available as a Sweep Option. Sweep Funds are described in the respective prospectuses for the UBS RMA Funds, UBS Cashfund, UBS Retirement Money Market Funds, UBS Liquid Assets Fund, UBS Cash Reserves Fund and the UBS Select Capital Money Market Funds.

The "UBS Bank Sweep Programs" collectively refers to the UBS Deposit Account Sweep Program (the "Deposit Program") and the UBS Business Account Sweep Program (the "Business Program") as more fully described in the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement.

UBS Bank USA (Member FDIC) ("Bank USA"), is an FDIC-member bank affiliate of UBS.

UBS AG, Stamford Branch ("AG Stamford Branch") is a US branch of UBS AG, a Swiss Bank that is the parent of UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico.

For clients other than Plans and Plan participants, the "Bank USA Sweep Cap" is $250,000 per Securities Account owner. For Plans and Plan participants, the Bank USA Sweep Cap is $250,000 per Securities Account.

Please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for important information about how the UBS Bank Sweep Programs work, how the Bank Sweep Cap is determined, eligibility, interest rates, withdrawal limits, FDIC insurance and your relationship with UBS, Bank USA and AG Stamford Branch. You should review the Disclosure carefully.

SDNY_GM_00274218

EFTA00016569

your available cash balances swept without limit to a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund or, for Puerto Rico residents only, the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc.

The following tax-advantaged Sweep Funds currently are available:

- UBS RMA Tax-Free Fund Inc.
- UBS RMA California Municipal Money Fund
- UBS RMA New York Municipal Money Fund
- The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc.
- UBS Select Tax-Free Capital Fund (subject to minimum asset requirements)

State-specific municipal funds are intended for residents of those states only. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. is offered exclusively to Puerto Rico residents as defined in the fund's prospectus. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund is not a money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, does not comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds, presents a higher degree of risk than those funds, and is for Puerto Rico residents holding accounts with UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico only. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund and the Sweep Funds are sold by prospectus only, and are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by a bank, and may lose value.

If your Account is tax-advantaged, or is a Basic Investment Account, whether tax-advantaged or not, you are not eligible to select a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund as a Sweep Option. Tax-advantaged Accounts include, but are not limited to, Accounts of Plans, Plan Participants and IRAs. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment Account is not an Investment Advisory Account, and you choose not to participate in a Bank Sweep Program, available cash balances will remain in your Account and will not earn interest. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment Account is an Investment Advisory Account, available cash balances must be swept through a Bank Sweep Program.

## Changing Your Sweep Option

You may change your sweep election to an available alternative Sweep Option at any time. By instructing us to change your sweep election, you are authorizing and directing us to redeem your Sweep Fund shares, or withdraw funds from one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, and transfer the funds to your new Sweep Option. You may change your sweep election by contacting your Financial Advisor.

For additional information regarding program availability and Account eligibility, please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement and the UBS International Deposit Account Sweep Program Disclosure in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, and to the prospectuses for the Sweep Funds and the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund.

## Institutional Sweep Funds and Automatic Exchanges

We may offer Institutional Sweep Funds as Sweep Options or Secondary Sweep Options for clients (except for Plans and IRAs in investment advisory programs) who meet certain minimum asset thresholds. Current eligibility criteria may be obtained from your Financial Advisor. UBS may change the eligibility criteria at any time in its discretion without notice to you. Institutional Sweep Funds will generally offer a higher yield than other Sweep Funds, though there is no guarantee that the yield will be, or will remain, higher.

### Clients other than Plans and Plan Participants

Your eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund.

### Plans and Plan Participants

A Plan's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each month, based on the value of the Plan's QP Relationship assets, as determined in the sole

"Secondary Sweep Option" refers to deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch or one of the available Sweep Funds.

"Investment Advisory Account" refers to an Account enrolled in any of the following investment advisory programs: Managed Accounts Consulting Program, Portfolio Management Program, ACCESS, Managed Portfolio Program, UBS Strategic Wealth Portfolio, UBS Strategic Advisor, and Private Wealth Solutions and such other programs as UBS may add from time to time.

Please refer to the section "International Accounts" for information about the sweep option for the International RMA.

"Institutional Sweep Funds" refers to one or more of the UBS money market funds made available by UBS to clients who meet certain minimum asset thresholds.

"QP Relationship assets" is defined in the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement.

discretion of UBS. A Plan Participant's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each month, based on the greater of the value of the Plan's QP Relationship assets and the Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets, both as determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of a Plan's QP Relationship assets or a Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, the Plan or Plan Participant will not be eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund.

If you are eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund as either your Sweep Fund or your Secondary Sweep Option for one of the Bank Sweep Programs, we will liquidate your shares in your current Sweep Fund or your Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, and purchase shares in the Institutional Sweep Fund with the same investment objectives without direction from you. Thereafter, your Sweep Fund or Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, will be the Institutional Sweep Fund. Once an Account's Sweep Option or Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, is an Institutional Sweep Fund and a first purchase has been made into the Fund, that Institutional Sweep Fund will remain the Account's Sweep Option or Secondary Sweep Option even if the Account's Marketing Relationship assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for that Institutional Sweep Fund.

## Check Writing

Many UBS accounts incorporate a check writing feature. If you choose this feature for your account, you authorize us and our Check Provider to honor checks that bear your signature(s) and unsigned drafts that are presented on the basis of separate written authorization from you to the payee. These checks may be used only in conjunction with your accounts and only up to the account's "Withdrawal Limit" as defined in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. We will deduct funds from your Accounts and reimburse the Check Provider in federal funds when checks or drafts are presented to the Check Provider. We may delay or deny payment if there are insufficient available assets in your Account to cover payment on the day you write the check or authorize the draft through the day on which we deduct funds from your accounts to pay the check or draft.

## Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Services

Many UBS accounts incorporate the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer services. If you enroll in these services, you authorize UBS and its processing bank to effect the types of transactions described in the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Service Agreement. This service agreement also applies to other electronic transfers to or from your Accounts, including transfers made with UBS CashConnect feature and certain payments made through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") system, even if you do not enroll in this service.

"Check Provider" is the provider and processor we have appointed to handle payment of your checks and drafts. We reserve the right to change check providers from time to time.

The Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Service Agreement is located in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

Bill payments are only available to payees located in the U.S.

Transfers through the ACH system are only available to and from accounts at financial institutions and banks within the U.S.

Once each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account the amount of purchases made with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer but not yet deducted from your Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if there are insufficient assets to cover transactions.

When you request a Credit Card, the Card Issuer will obtain a credit report as part of your application and after it establishes your Credit Card account to administer your Credit Card account and report its credit experience with you to others. At your request, the Card Issuer will provide the name and address of each consumer reporting agency from which it obtained a report about you. After your Credit Card account is open, you will have the opportunity to select how the Card Issuer can use or share information about you for marketing or Credit Card account maintenance purposes.

# International Deposit Account Sweep Program

The Sweep Option for International Accounts is generally the UBS International Deposit Account Sweep Program (IDA). The IDA is an interest-bearing account maintained by UBS AG at the Cayman Islands Branch where funds are invested into short-term deposits. If you are eligible and choose to participate in the IDA sweep program, free cash balances in your Accounts are automatically deposited into a demand deposit account at the New York Branch of UBS AG, from which funds are then swept and re-deposited each business day into an overnight deposit account at the Cayman Islands branch of UBS AG. As your agent, UBS Financial Services Inc. will make the necessary withdrawals from the New York deposit account to satisfy debits or charges in your Account in accordance with the General Terms and Conditions. You may choose to withdraw from the IDA Program at any time, however, your free cash balances in your Account at UBS Financial Services Inc. will not earn interest or dividends. Funds on deposit in the accounts at the New York and the Cayman Islands branches of UBS AG are not eligible for federal deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

# Insurance Accounts

As a service to clients, we also offer accounts to maintain or permit the purchase of insurance products and services. By signing the Signature Page for your non-brokerage insurance account, you accept the Client Relationship Agreement and the other documents referred to here, and as a result, you may be able to open brokerage accounts with us in the future without having to sign additional agreements.

# Joint Accounts

For joint accounts, each person or entity named on the Account has full power and authority over the Account, and the account holders are jointly and severally liable for all obligations with respect to the Account. Please refer to the "Joint Accounts" section of the General Terms and Conditions for more information about the terms and conditions that apply to joint accounts.

When we open additional joint accounts for the same account holders, we establish them with the same legal ownership as the most recently-opened joint account, unless we are instructed otherwise. If you request a different form of ownership, we will request your signature acknowledging that election. For example, if you open an account as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, your next account with the same parties will also be established as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless you tell us you want a different type of ownership for that account.

# Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements

All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By signing the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan or for an Estate, you agree that the Margin Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current Accounts and any Accounts that you may open in the future.

Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, if you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your margin agreement with us will remain in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we will confirm your request.

When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin-eligible Accounts are subject to applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree to maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we deem necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account to satisfy any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account.

As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we carry for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to ourselves or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for such Property.

When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If you are engaged in short selling a security, you may incur a charge due to certain borrowing costs for that particular security.

Subject to applicable rules and regulations, we may amend, the requirements applicable to your margin account at any time in our sole discretion, including changing the level of credit available to you and applicable maintenance requirements without notice to you. A prior demand or call, or prior notice of the time and place of such sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of our right to sell or buy without demand or notice as described here. For additional terms, please refer to the section "Liquidation of Collateral or Account" below.

If you do not want to establish margin for your current accounts or any accounts you open in the future, please contact your Financial Advisor.

Please note: UBS does not extend margin for the following accounts:

- Individual Retirement Accounts
- ERISA Plans
- Coverdell Education Savings Account
- 403(b)(7) Accounts
- UGMA
- UTMA
- Estate
- 529 Plan Accounts

Hypothecation is the pledging of securities or other assets to secure a loan such as debit balance in a margin account.

"Property" includes, but is not limited to, securities, securities entitlements, investment property and financial assets, including without limitation, money, stocks, options, bonds, notes, futures contracts, commodities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and other obligations, contracts, all other property usually and customarily dealt in by brokerage firms and any other property that can be recorded in any of your Accounts, as well as the Accounts themselves.

SDNY_GM_00274223
EFTA00016574

We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of a margin loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to all rights provided by law, we have the right to:

1. require additional collateral,
2. sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or jointly with others,
3. buy any Property which may be held short in your Account,
4. cancel any open orders and close any or all outstanding contracts, or
5. liquidate any of your Accounts with us.

We may also exercise these rights if in our discretion we consider it necessary for your or our protection; if a bankruptcy petition, or petition for the appointment of a receiver, is filed by or against you; if an attachment is levied against any Account; or in the event of your death or dissolution.

You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, or otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the Loan Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet carefully for a detailed discussion of these risks.

## Security Interest

As security for the payment of all liabilities or indebtedness presently outstanding or to be incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not limited to any loans or promissory notes, you hereby grant to each UBS Entity a security interest in and lien on any and all Property held or carried by any UBS Entity for you or on your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in which you may have any legal, equitable or other interest.

All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of your obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to whether or not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security interest, we have the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the Property will be sold and have all the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in addition to all other rights provided in this Agreement or by law.

You will not cause or allow any of the Property held in any of your UBS Accounts, whether owned now or acquired later, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, mortgages or encumbrances of any nature other than our security interest, without our prior written consent. Each UBS Entity shall act as agent for and on behalf of each UBS Entity for purposes of perfecting, maintaining and enforcing the security interests granted hereunder or by operation of law. Each UBS Entity acting in the capacity of a deposit bank, securities intermediary or commodities intermediary, agrees to follow the instructions and entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity with respect to the Property as a secured party without further consent by you. You hereby authorize and direct each UBS Entity to follow the instructions and entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity.

Please refer to the UBS Statement of Credit Practices for additional information.

"UBS," "we," "us," "our" and "ours" refer to UBS Financial Services Inc. and, unless we indicate otherwise, its successor firms, subsidiaries, correspondents and Affiliates, including without limitation, its parent company, UBS AG.

# Liquidation of Collateral or Account

We may satisfy any and all amounts you owe us in connection with any of your Accounts or agreements with us, or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not limited to any loans or promissory notes, from Property we hold or carry in any of your Accounts with us (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation). Additionally, we may sell any or all Property held in any of your Accounts with us and cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any Property without notice in the event of your death or dissolution, or whenever in our discretion it is necessary for our protection. In these instances, we may also borrow or buy-in all Property held in any of your Accounts required to make delivery against any sale initiated for you. These sales or purchases may be public or private and may be made without advertising or notice to you and in the manner we determine in our sole discretion. You waive diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of nonpayment and further waive all other notices and formalities to which you may be entitled under applicable law or otherwise, to the extent the waiver of such notices and other formalities is permissible under applicable law. Your waiver will not be invalidated by any demands, calls, tenders or notices that we may make. At any sale, we may purchase the Property or any portion thereof free of any right of redemption and you will remain liable for any deficiency in any of your Accounts, plus any accrued interest on the deficiency at our then customary rate, if applicable, or at the maximum rate allowable by law. We will not be liable to you in any way for any losses or adverse tax consequences resulting from a liquidation of your Property.

# USA Patriot Act

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information and documentation identifying each account holder. Therefore, when you open an Account, we ask for your name, address, date of birth and other identifying information about you. We may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. We may also screen your name against various databases to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may take any of the actions described under "Termination of your Account" in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

# Credit Report

When you open an account with us, we may obtain your credit report or other credit references and verify or update the credit information you may have given to us previously. We may make verbal and written inquiries concerning your credit history. Likewise, we may request your credit report or other credit information and provide it to our Card Issuers and Check Provider or to our affiliates, as necessary or advisable to service and maintain your Accounts. We also use this information to offer you additional products that may be of interest to you.

# Your Privacy

At UBS, we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. Please refer to the UBS Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, which describes the personal information we collect about you and how we handle and protect it.

## Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership

The issuers of securities held in your Accounts may request your name, address and security position so that they may contact you directly for proxy voting and other shareholder communications. You may instruct us not to supply this information, in which case, you will receive information regarding those securities from UBS instead of the issuers. Your current instructions are reflected on the Account Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package. If you would like to change your instructions, please call your Financial Advisor.

As described in the section "Foreign Securities" in the General Terms and Conditions, we may share information about the beneficial ownership of foreign securities in your Accounts with the issuers of those securities, foreign government authorities of their agent, to obtain reduced tax withholding rates, to comply with local law or to respond to other lawful requests.

## Householding of Statements and Other Communications

As a convenience to you, we may consolidate periodic communications for certain accounts with the same address. This practice, called "householding," applies to account statements, trade confirmations, personal and financial information required to be sent by regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts statements, which provide consolidated information for all of the accounts in your household. Households are determined as follows:

- Accounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID Number are automatically placed in the same household.
- Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household only with the express consent of all the Account holders.

We mail household communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, if you receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or other electronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS Online Services can have access to view all Accounts in the household.

The composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household mailing address, and the addressee for household mailings may also change over time. Where owners of joint accounts live at different addresses, household mailings will be sent to at least one account owner's address and may be included with mailings for other accounts at that address under the conditions described above.

## Periodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain personal and financial information to our clients

Because we deliver these records with your account statements, other members of your household may have access to these records unless you instruct us to send them to you separately.

If you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual mailings in separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means.

## E-mail Communications

We discourage clients from transmitting personal or confidential information through e-mail. If you choose to send personal and confidential information to us via e-mail, we cannot be responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result, such as losses or damages arising from mistaken identity or unauthorized access and the use of the information (for any purpose) by others who may intercept or otherwise access the communications during and after transmission.

Please see the UBS Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet for further information, including how to opt-out of certain information sharing.

Please refer to the Client Privacy Notice for more information about Statement Householding.

If you do not want your statements to be bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual account statements mailed in separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means.

# Representations and Agreement for Trustee Certification

## Representation of a Trust Agreement in Effect

For trust accounts, each Trustee, certifies, represents and warrants that the trust to which this certification applies is in full force and effect and that the information you have supplied to UBS is true and accurate, as we rely on that information to service your accounts.

Unless we are updated subsequently by the trustees, UBS will rely on this certification, which includes the information you provide on the Signature Page, to service accounts you may open in the future for the same trust. By signing a UBS Trustee Certification and Agreement, you agree that:

- Each trustee (or a corporate officer if the account is a corporate trust) executed the certification.
- You have full power under the trust agreement and applicable law to submit valid orders and other instructions relative to the trust Account(s).
- The trust agreement authorizes you to make distributions and transfers from the trust.
- You have received and read the “UBS Client Relationship Agreement” and the documents it references and agree to those terms and conditions for all accounts you open on behalf of the trust.
- As Trustee(s), you have broad investment powers under the Trust and applicable law. You have noted any restrictions on your power as trustee(s) on the Signature Page for the first trust account you open, and agree that the powers and restrictions listed here and on the Signature Page are accurate and complete.

## Trustee’s Ability to Bind the Trust

Unless you indicate otherwise on the Signature Page, you agree that any individual trustee may independently exercise any of the trust’s powers. This means that UBS is authorized to take instructions from and accept any document on behalf of the trust (including but not limited to agreements to arbitrate all disputes involving the trust account) signed by any one of the trustees. In some instances, however, we may require the joint action of all trustees for certain activities.

- We agree to resolve any controversy, claim or issue in any controversy that may arise by arbitration, whether it happen before or after, or at the time this Agreement was executed, including but not limited to controversies, claims or issues in any controversy concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, performance or breach of this Agreement or any other agreement.
- Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange's arbitration forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with you, including, where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
- Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the panel.

- No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until:
- the class certification is denied; or
- the class is decertified; or
- the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.
- You expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served by certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS.
- You expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above.
