Counsel,

The Government's first discovery production in this case has been loaded onto the drive you provided this afternoon and is ready for pickup at our office. If you are sending a runner to pick up the production, he or she should just ask for the envelope with Michael Miller's name on it. I've also attached a copy of the accompanying discovery and disclosure letter to this email.

Please let me know if you have any difficulty accessing the discovery on the drive.

Best,
