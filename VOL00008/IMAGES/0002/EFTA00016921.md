Chris and Mark just called me a few minutes ago, wanting to generally check in and see if we wanted or needed anything from them. I said that as a general matter, in terms of status, the investigation is ongoing, and that I didn't have any additional information beyond that. On whether we needed anything, I said I would circle up with the team and get them an answer on that. Initially my thought was to say no, nothing needed from them right now, but now I wonder, do we want to issue any document subpoenas to GM? Photos, communications, journals, memo pads, financial records associated with Epstein, or anything else . . . thoughts??
