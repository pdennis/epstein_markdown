Hi [REDACTED] and [REDACTED],

I hope you're both well! I just wanted to follow up with you both, as I hadn't received an answer from [REDACTED] yet and wanted to make sure the drives (below) were dealt with today if they're time-sensitive. I received both drives today in the mail from PAE, and both appear to contain the same materials. Do they need to be copied or sent out?

Thank you!

Hi [REDACTED]!

Just received these two hard drives from PAE. Would you like me to handle next steps? And is this time-sensitive? Thanks!

Happy to chat about this over email or phone 😊

Hello,

All of the productions (production 15 &amp; 16) has been copied to both hard drives. Please let me know who should receive the hard drives?

Thank you.

Good Morning,

I wanted to let you know that the vendor has finished the stamping of part 5 of the production. Parts 1 – 3 have been exported from Relativity. The vendor will start the stamping of part 6 of the production shortly.

The vendor has also been able to load the data for the USAO-SDFL files into the other Epstein database:

Please review and let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.

Thank you very much, [REDACTED]. Looking on Relativity, it appears that part 4 is at least stamped now, which puts us more than halfway through the stamping. We are planning to ask Judge Nathan for an extension, but given how quickly the stamping and export appeared to go today, I am hopeful that this may be ready sooner than the November 19th date we’ve been discussing.

Hello,

The vendor had to break up the production into seven parts. As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1 – 3 and is about to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is currently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and the export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches:

If there are any questions please let me know.

Thank you.
