I have some thoughts and edits on the draft remarks for your consideration in the attached version. As you'll see, they're principally geared toward simplifying some of the language and shortening sentences. Thanks.

Audrey – We’ve put together some draft remarks and a Q&amp;A for a potential press conference next week. The team is also working with the press office to put together a visual. Happy to discuss further after you’ve had a chance to review.

Thanks,
