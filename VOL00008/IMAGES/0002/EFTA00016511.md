Subject: URGENT--Update Maxwell Victim Notice
Importance: High

See Ed Friedland’s request below. Can you come up with a current update that explains whatever victims should know about attending the trial? (And makes clear that the dial-in info for previous proceedings is no longer applicable?) [redacted] can add it to our Maxwell victim page.

This info on your web page is outdated and is causing the public to try and access the Maxwell matter by phone. Can you pull down the access number info and update with the latest order which says in-person?
