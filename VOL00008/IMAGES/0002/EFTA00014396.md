Re: the below, I just got a bounce-back from [REDACTED] that she's out tomorrow. Is this something one of you might be able to check and/or assist with? Or should I just do it myself tomorrow?

thanks,

Wanted to see if you had reserved a conference room for us, per the below from Thursday? I got a confirmation for the hotel (attached) but it doesn't seem to say anything about a conference room. Could you please let us know either way? And if not yet, could you please reserve that for us tomorrow (Tuesday) and let us know when it's finalized?

thank you!

Apologies for the slight delay yesterday on this travel, we had a witness scheduling issue so the travel will be a day later than originally anticipated. The city is Pensacola, Florida, and it will be me and [REDACTED] (rather than [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]).

[REDACTED] if you could please book me on the following flights:

Feb. 19: Delta, LGA to PNS, 9:00 a.m. (arriving 12:49 p.m.)
Feb. 20: Delta, PNS to LGA, 4:06 p.m. (arriving 9:41 p.m.)

And the following hotel, for the night of Feb. 19:
- Hilton Garden Inn (listed in E2 as "HGI PENSACOLA AIRPORT MEDICAL")

We will also need a conference room at the Hilton Garden Inn for February 19, starting at 5:00 p.m. for three hours (or for the entire day, if that's the only way they'll do it).

Please let us know if any questions or issues, and thanks as always.

Hi,

Which specific city will the hotel be in?

If [redacted] could push the travel authorizations thru to [redacted] &amp; I today, that would be great... As well as sending the conference room payment request to [redacted].

Remember to take the FL tax exempt form along with you.

Thanks

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), [redacted] and I would like to please request permission for the two of us to travel next week for an interview of a witness in Pensacola, Florida on 2/19. We'd plan to fly down on 2/18 and fly back on 2/19. Also, similar to prior requests, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room on 2/19.

Thank you,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th (overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on our formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days at a hotel for the interview itself.

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on that.

thank you,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
