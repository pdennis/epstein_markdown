Hi _______________________________________________________________ " &gt;

Yes, I relayed our last conversations to the AUSAs after we spoke. Defense counsel continues to press (with us as well) for delivery requirements that are inconsistent with the way we understand other defendants' mail to be treated and the way we typically treat mail bound for in-custody defendants. Happy to discuss by phone.

Thanks,

Did you discuss with the AUSAs about tempering expectations on the delivery of the hard drives?

Good morning-
The government has sent a hard drive to the MDC via Federal Express for Ms. Maxwell.
Upon arrival, it must IMMEDIATELY be given to Ms. Maxwell.
Time is of the essence.
Please inform me when it arrives.
Thank you-
Bobbi
