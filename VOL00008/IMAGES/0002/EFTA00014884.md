Counsel,

We’re required to propose and docket any redactions to the filings related to ___________ and the other experts today. (See Dkt. No. 495). We’ve attached our proposed redactions, and we propose to seal Exhibit B to the Government’s motion in full.

Please let us know if you have any proposed redactions. Per our previous process, we’ll file a cover letter and send the redactions to the Court, file redacted versions of our motion, wait for you to file a redacted opposition, and then file our redacted reply.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
