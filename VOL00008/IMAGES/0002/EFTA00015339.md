See below from attorney. Is it fair to say that, at this time, the government is not interested in further interviewing him on the Epstein matter?

The jury went overnight again so unfortunately I will not be available tomorrow. We have to reschedule the proffer.

My sincere apologies.

We summed up on Monday and I was expecting a verdict yesterday but the jury is still deliberating. I hope and expect you to get a verdict today, but I will let you know for sure at the end of the day.

Thanks
