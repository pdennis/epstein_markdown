Good evening,

Attached for Judge Nathan’s review please find a letter from MDC legal counsel regarding the above-referenced case. Because the MDC is not a party to this case, this letter has not been filed on ECF, but the Government has no objection to the public docketing of this letter.

Respectfully submitted,

Assistant United States Attorney
