Not sure if this went through last night. Prepare to be disgusted.

Yes, got 'em, but unfortunately most of the files are too big to send via email – I'll send an email to Lou asking for share drive access for you both, and when you get access the defense letters we currently have are here (the smallest one is attached):

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\#Florida Scans\Jeffrey Epstein\Letters from Epstein's attorneys

and the indictment materials we currently have, including draft indictments, are here:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\#Florida Scans\Jeffrey Epstein\GJ

thanks,
Alex.

Any progress in getting the scanned docs from the trip? Particularly interested in seeing the draft indictment and defense submissions.
