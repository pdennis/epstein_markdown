Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for a witness who is needed for grand jury prep on February 7th in the Epstein case. The witness will need to fly up from Florida the day before (February 6th). His cellphone number is included in the request form, and he should be expecting a call from you or someone in your department to work out the logistics.

Let me know if you need any other information, and thank you so much for your help.
