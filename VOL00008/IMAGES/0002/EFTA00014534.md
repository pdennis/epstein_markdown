All,

Our first discovery production will include approximately 12 GB of data. As a result, we need to request that you please provide us with a drive (or drives if you would like multiple copies) on which to load the discovery for you. You can either bring the drive(s) to tomorrow's conference, or you can send them to our office at the below address to my attention. Once we receive a drive (or drives) from you, we will get it loaded and sent back out to you as quickly as possible.

Additionally, if you would like Mr. Epstein to receive his own electronic copy of the discovery to review at the MCC, please provide us with a hard drive (not a thumb drive—the MCC will only accept external hard drives) for us to load and send to the MCC for his review.

Best,
