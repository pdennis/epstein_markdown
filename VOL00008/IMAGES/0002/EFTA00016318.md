Yep I got it. It's downloading now but will take a little while. It's about 11 GB.

PBSA is giving us their entire Epstein file.

Will, when I get the email with the info about how to download the file, I'll forward it to you. Would you please download everything and save it on the share? You can put it here: USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\PBSA Epstein File
