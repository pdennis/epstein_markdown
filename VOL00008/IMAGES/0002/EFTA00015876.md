Dear

Thank you for your interest in the case of U.S. v. Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Barr’s chief of staff has forwarded your questions and insights to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, as the investigation that resulted in Jeffrey Epstein’s July arrest was conducted by our office and the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Your questions and concerns have been forwarded to the appropriate people here in our office. As I’m sure you can appreciate, we will be extremely limited in what we can tell you about the ongoing investigation. You may nevertheless feel free to email me with any additional information or questions, and I will forward them to the appropriate people here.
