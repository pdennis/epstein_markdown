Hi

I've been working to get all of the subpoena returns organized for this case. In going through the tracker of bank subpoenas and returns that you sent over on June 2nd, I was unable to find any corresponding returns on our shared drive. I understand that in the past you have been sending them over on discs but given the circumstances would you be able to also have them uploaded to USAfx?

Thanks,
