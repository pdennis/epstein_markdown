- Intake Line

this caller got directed to call the 1-2500 intake line (wrongly, as that is just for law enforcement and we are trying to stop whomever is doing that). He should have called the FBI number in your press release. Could you please forward this to your FBI agents and let them deal with it? If they get back to you and say they know him and he is a crazy, let me know that, and we will figure out his mailing address and send him out the usual form letter from the Civilian Crime Reports Unit, with a form to fill out. And we will deal with him if he continues to be a problem. But before we do that, just in case this is useful, let the FBI hear it and let us know whether to process it in the CCR system. Thanks.
