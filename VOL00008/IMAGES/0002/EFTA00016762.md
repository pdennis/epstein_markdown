Hello, this is Mihir Zaveri, reporter at The New York Times.

We are seeing reports that Jeffrey Epstein was found injured in his jail cell after a possible suicide attempt or some sort of assault: https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Jeffrey-Epstein-Found-Injured-in-NYC-Jail-Cell-After-Possible-Suicide-Attempt-or-Assault-Sources-513174311.html

Hoping tonight to confirm this or get any insight into what might have actually happened and where he is right now.

I can be reached at [redacted].
