Hi Nick—just passing this on, I haven't responded, but for what it's worth this reporter contacted me at the email address for the law school where I teach a small class, which I didn't appreciate.

Subject: Epstein[redacted] and US/French international justice (journalist question)

Hi[redacted], I'm the US correspondent for 20 Minutes, a French newspaper.

I'm working on a Epstein[redacted] piece, and I had some questions (it can be 100% of the record or purely for background) about how such a case work between US/French judicial authorities when key events and players are linked to several countries.

Could I call you to talk about it?
Thank you so much,
Philippe
