As I mentioned last night, attached is a SAR that filed today in connection with persons associated with Jeffrey Epstein. The bank would like to close all of the accounts of the entities named in the SAR as soon as possible. (The current balance on those accounts is approximately $30 million.) Before doing so, the bank wanted to make your office aware of these accounts in case the government intends to take any action.

Please advise once you've had a chance to consider.

Many thanks.
