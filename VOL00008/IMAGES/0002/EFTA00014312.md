My former partner, Alan Ross, represented , prior to his passing in 2018. Agent served with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan's former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

Joe
