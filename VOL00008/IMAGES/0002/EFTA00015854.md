SDNY is fine with allowing the cell to go back into normal use. Thank you.

Good evening everyone,

I was contacted by BOP MCC NY Warden [redacted] this afternoon and he asked whether it was ok for the MCC to return to the normal usage of the cell in the Special Housing Unit where Jeffrey Epstein was housed and the incident occurred. He mentioned that he recalled being told by someone at some point it was ok to begin using the cell again to house inmates but wants to confirm it is ok to do so before reopening the cell for normal use. I told Warden [redacted] that I would check with the Investigative Team and get back to him next week. Please let me know if he should continue to keep the cell secured and unoccupied or if he can begin using the cell to house inmates. Thank you all and have a nice weekend.
