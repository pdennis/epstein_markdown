Thanks, and sounds good. And [redacted] and I chatted a bit about his conversation with Kaplan – [redacted], let me know if/when you get back to her, and happy to circle up to talk further thereafter.

It was good, for the most part. Making progress. [redacted] and I interviewed two witnesses on Friday at the BSF office in Fort Lauderdale. The third witness we were supposed to interview decided not to come at the last minute, because she decided she didn’t want to be involved in the case after all this time has passed. She was not someone we were focused on at this stage, so while we may circle back at another time to see if she comes in, right now it’s fine.

We had a call with an attorney who represented FL victims a decade ago, and we’re coordinating with him to schedule follow up interviews with two of the witnesses who were approached and said they weren’t sure how the civil case their lawyer handled affected if they could talk to us.

[redacted] had a call with Robbie Kaplan right before the trip, and the upshot is we are making baby steps towards an interview with [redacted]. They are concerned about her exposure, so we are discussing ways of addressing that, and the next step will likely be an attorney proffer.
