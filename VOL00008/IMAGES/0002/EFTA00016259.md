Further my earlier email today, as of 10:30 a.m., USPO tracking lists the following 4 items of legal mail "Available for Pickup" and does not indicate that MDC has retrieved or received them.

Ms. Maxwell has not received legal mail in more than a week.

Please confirm IMMEDIATELY the status of these items on your end.

Failure to response today will result in the filing of an order to show cause requiring your presence in Court.
