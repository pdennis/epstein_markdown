Re: Request for asset forfeiture of property acquired by Jeffrey Epstein to commit human trafficking in New Mexico at Zorro Ranch

Acting United States Attorney

Our office has provided investigative evidence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s use of the Zorro Ranch, located in Stanley, New Mexico, to assist federal prosecutors. In furtherance of achieving some measure of justice for victims of Epstein and his acolytes, I ask that any interests belonging to Epstein’s estate or co-conspirators be seized by federal authorities. We believe that this ranch was used by Epstein and others to facilitate the commission and prolonged concealment of his trafficking of children, such that seizure may be pursued in conjunction with the pending criminal prosecution of Epstein’s associates and co-conspirators.

My priority is to assist federal prosecution efforts in identifying any and all assets used by Epstein and others in New Mexico to facilitate the commission and concealment of his crimes. To this end, we call upon your office to include the improvements of this property and any substitute assets as part of the civil forfeiture of property associated with any pending cases against Epstein’s estate or involved with the criminal prosecution of his co-conspirators.

In the event you need assistance investigating or eventually pursuing this avenue, I will gladly offer the resources my office has available to ensure that all survivors of crimes committed in New Mexico receive some measure of justice, closure, and eventual restitution.
