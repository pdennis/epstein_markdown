Subject: RE: letter to Epstein estate trustees' counsel

Team, we understand you've asked us to draft a letter to the executors of Epstein's estate (who are also the co-trustees of the 1953 Trust Agreement) on a couple issues – a draft is attached for your review. We've also included a question about any waiver of attorney-client privilege, which will be helpful to have their position on in connection with our discovery review and production process.

thanks,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
