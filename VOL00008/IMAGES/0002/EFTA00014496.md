[REDACTED]

With apologies for the bother, and understanding that we've been in the midst of holidays, do you have a sense of when we might be able to receive the list of clients represented [REDACTED] / you / BSF currently represent? We're in the process of planning a possible trip to Florida potentially as early as the beginning of next week and we think a meeting would be most productive if we can do some groundwork on relevant individuals in advance, ideally today or tomorrow if at all possible. Similarly, if we're able to get the confidentiality / protective order this week, we can consider what steps we can take in the coming days regarding those issues as well.

If it would be helpful for us to do a call with [REDACTED] to make the requests directly, or to talk through any issues, we are also very happy to do that, that's no problem at all. And if we are able to get that information this week, and we can get permission and funding to travel next week, we can set up a meeting with him as well. We're on the starters blocks here and very ready to start running (again, fully recognizing that the past couple weeks have been holidays and vacation time for most folks).

thanks again,

[REDACTED]

Thanks very much, this is helpful, and in terms of follow up, the absolute most helpful thing for us at this stage – and this may be forthcoming, but just wanted to reiterate – would be to have a list of the names of the victims currently represented by you / BSF / [Redacted]. If that needs to wait until [Redacted] is back from vacation, that’s no problem at all, but it would just be, I think, the names of the plaintiffs in the VRA lawsuit (unless there are other civil suit clients separate from that case and in addition to the two SDNY cases we’ve already discussed).

thanks again,

In further reply to your asks, here is some information that may be of help:

1. [Redacted] has a list of all known victims of JE who were victims during the period of his trafficking in Florida. [Redacted] also knows the names of the lawyers who represent the girls. You have a number of lawyers’ names from yesterday, but [Redacted] can match them up to specific clients, by names. He said that the USA also has that information—that is, attorney names and their client names—so that may be how you prefer to proceed. He said there are 40 names attached to the NPA, which I assume you have—or have access to. But [Redacted] also has the names of additional girls, beyond the 40, and will provide them to you. (He may be the only person who has these additional names. Not sure that the USA or the Bureau has them.)
2. I will be receiving a copy of Judge Sweet’s confidentiality order in [Redacted] v. Maxwell and will forward it to you when I get it. (Vacations this week are slowing things a bit.)
3. With regard to lawyers who represent, or did at one time, various victims and actors, here are their names as recalled by [Redacted] from his hammock on a beach with his wife and kids in Costa Rica, mojito (I am guessing) in hand:

LAWYERS FOR EPSTEIN: ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ROY BLACK. GUY LEWIS. MICHAEL TIEN. MARTY WEINBERG. BOB CRITTON. MIKE PIKE. SCOTT LINK. REID WEINGARTEN. GERRY LEFCOURT. JAY LEFKOWITZ. KEN STARR. CHET BREWER. JACK GOLDBERGER. FRED HADDAD. TONJA HADDAD. LIKLY SANCHEZ. JOE ACKERMAN. CHRIS KNIGHT. MICHAEL MILLER. JUSTIN CHU. THERE WERE A COUPLE MORE INSIGNIFICANT ONES.

LAWYERS FOR PILOTS, JE HOUSE STAFF, AND [Redacted] - All represented by BRUCE REINHART (now a federal magistrate judge); ERICA DUBNO. JOHN STEPHENSON. (Make a note to discuss Erica Dubno, NYC attorney, when we talk. I wonder if she might not be of some help.)

LAWYERS FOR GHISLAINE MAXWELL: REPRESENTED BY COHEN GRESSER FIRM FIRST, THEN LAURA MENNINGER, DENVER, COLO.

OTHER ATTORNEYS PAID BY EPSTEIN WHO TO REPRESENT VARIOUS WITNESSES: MIKE DUTKO. “THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS THAT SLIP MY MIND BUT ILL REMEMBER AND SEND THEM.”
