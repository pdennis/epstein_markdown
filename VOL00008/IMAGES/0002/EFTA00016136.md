Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, No. 19-cr-00490
Defendant’s Request for Particulars, Discovery and Brady Material

Dear :

We are writing on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein regarding discovery in this case. In order to preserve Mr. Epstein’s rights, and to request additional information, we respectfully submit this formal request for discovery in this case pursuant to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Rules 12, 16, and 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the additional authority set forth below.

This request encompasses not only documents and information in your possession, custody, or control, but also documents that the government has the legal right or practical ability to obtain. Such information includes but is not limited to information in the possession, custody, or control of any agency of the United States involved in any way in regulating or investigating the activities alleged in the Indictment or related transactions, including but not limited to the Department of Justice (including but not limited to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and all United States Attorney’s Offices), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, such information includes information in

the possession, custody, and control of any local, state, or foreign law enforcement entities involved in any way in regulating or investigating the activities alleged in the Indictment or related transactions.¹ Finally, such information includes information gathered and/or produced from private entities aiding in the government’s investigation.²

The defendant, through counsel, requests that the government comply with all of its discovery obligations under federal law, including but not limited to the following:³

## I. Statements of the Defendant

Pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Mr. Epstein requests any written or recorded statements made by Mr. Epstein, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the government.

## IV. Brady Material

A. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, including Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976), United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), and Kyles v. Whitney, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), and Judge Berman’s Individual Practices, Mr. Epstein requests immediate identification and disclosure of all materials that are exculpatory, would tend to negate the guilt of Mr. Epstein or mitigate the offenses, would tend to impeach any potential witnesses, or are relevant to issues of punishment or sentencing, which are in the government’s possession, custody, or control, or otherwise known to the government, including but not limited to:

1. Any documents or information indicating or tending to establish that any of the allegations in the Indictment are not true;

5. Any documents or information indicating or tending to establish that:

a. Some or all of the conduct in the Indictment is subject to the NPA; and
b. Some or all of the conduct was known to the government prior to June 30, 2008.

EFTA00016143

STEPTOE &amp; JOHNSON LLP

6. Any documents or information that may serve to impeach any government witness, including but not limited to:

a. Any documents or information that show any conviction or arrest of any government witness;

b. Any documents or information relating to promises made or any consideration or inducements made to any prospective government witness, whether directly to the witness or indirectly to the witness's attorney, friends, family, or business associates. "Consideration" means anything of value or use, including immunity grants, whether formal or informal, witness fees, transportation assistance, money, or assurance of favorable treatment with respect to any criminal, civil, or administrative matter;

c. Any documents or information relating to material inconsistencies between statements given or transmitted by any person to the government or to any private person or entity, and any statements or other information which would tend to impeach the credibility of any intended witness;

d. Any information bearing adversely on the character or reputation of any intended government witness, including any evidence of community reputation for lack of truthfulness;

e. Each specific instance of conduct from which it could be inferred that any intended government witness is untruthful;

f. Any documents or information tending to show the bias of a potential government witness, including animosity toward Mr. Epstein, animosity toward a group of which Mr. Epstein is a member or with which Mr. Epstein is affiliated, a relationship with an alleged victim, or known but uncharged criminal conduct that may provide an incentive to curry favor with a prosecutor;

g. Any documents or information affecting the reliability of a potential government witness's testimony, including known alcohol or substance abuse, mental health issues, or other issues that could affect the witness's ability to perceive and recall events;

h. Any documents or information relating to a witness or potential witness's interest in bringing a civil lawsuit against Mr. Epstein or

EFTA00016144

August 1, 2019
Page 10
Steptoe
STEPTOE &amp; JOHNSON LLP

seeking restitution or any other form of monetary benefit as a potential result of his conviction.

B. The date of and participants in each and every interview (including not only interviews conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, but also interviews conducted by other law enforcement entities and any third parties), debriefing, “queen for a day” session, proffer, deposition, or other statement or description of the alleged facts made by each potential government witness (whether directly or indirectly, such as a proffer made by counsel). In addition, please specify, as to each such witness, the first date on which the witness made any allegation that Mr. Epstein engaged in any allegedly unlawful conduct or any conduct alleged in the Indictment.

C. As you are aware, New York has adopted Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8, entitled “Special Responsibilities of Prosecutors and Other Government Lawyers,” which provides that a prosecutor shall “make timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant . . . of the existence of evidence or information known the prosecutor or other government lawyer that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the sentence. . . .” Rule 3.8(d). The Supreme Court has recognized that Rule 3.8 imposes a higher standard on prosecutors than the standards mandating disclosure of exculpatory evidence under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (“[Brady] requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures of any evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate”); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-3.11(a) (3d ed. 1993) (“A prosecutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure to the defense, at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the existence of all evidence or information which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged or which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused”); ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) (“The prosecutor in a criminal case shall . . . make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense”).

Mr. Epstein contends that the foregoing categories of information constitute Brady and Rule 3.8(d) material, and that disclosure should take place immediately. Mr. Epstein further requests that the government identify with particularity and provide copies of all materials that qualify as Brady and Rule 3.8 material, as described above. Please advise us promptly whether the government will be producing Brady material immediately even if it is contained in what might otherwise be considered as Jencks material, or whether you take the position that you are not obligated to produce such material at this time.

EFTA00016145

August 1, 2019
Page 11
Steptoe
STEPTOE &amp; JOHNSON LLP

D. Mr. Epstein also requests the underlying source material for any Brady and Rule 3.8(d) information, as opposed to any summary letter or paraphrased description of the information. Please advise us promptly whether the government will be producing underlying source material.

E. For purposes of the Brady doctrine, “the format of the information does not determine whether it is discoverable.” Department Memorandum for Department Prosecutors Providing Guidance for Prosecutors Regarding Criminal Discovery, at 6 (Jan. 4, 2010). For example, material exculpatory information that is provided “during a conversation with an agent or a witness is no less discoverable than if that same information were contained in an email.” *Id.* Similarly, the Second Circuit has recognized that attorney proffers are equally subject to Brady obligations as witness proffers. *States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc.*, 544 F.3d 149, 157, 165 (2d Cir. 2008) (recognizing that “[a]n attorney proffer apprises the government of what the client would be able to provide by way of testimony” and finding a Brady violation where the government failed to turn over notes from an attorney proffer). Mr. Epstein therefore expects that all such information will be memorialized and produced to Mr. Epstein.

F. Finally, Mr. Epstein notes Rule 4.C.3 of Judge Berman’s Individual Practices, which, *inter alia*, (1) requires disclosure of Brady materials within two weeks of its discovery; (2) re-affirms that the government’s obligation applies “regardless of whether the Government ‘credits’ the Brady Material”; and (3) re-affirms that the government’s obligations extend to “law enforcement and regulatory agencies that are or have been involved in the prosecution of the defendant or in parallel proceedings or investigations involving the defendant.”

## V. Jencks Material

Pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Mr. Epstein requests that the government provide a list of the names and addresses of all witnesses (and their counsel) that the government intends to call in its case-in-chief and all statements of those witnesses in the possession, custody, or control of the government or any other governmental entity, including but not limited to notes of interviews, FBI 302s, or other summaries prepared by government attorneys or agents, and grand jury transcripts and any other witness statements. Mr. Epstein requests that the government begin providing this material as soon as possible, or in any event no later than February 8, 2020 or, if there is a setting of the trial date after June 8, 2020, one hundred and twenty days before that trial date.

This includes but is not limited to:

2. All handwriting exemplars, handwriting samples, handwriting or document analyses, and all documents examined or used in or related to such analyses;

4. All polygraph examinations, psychological stress examinations, hypnotic procedures, or any other scientific procedures devised to determine whether a subject is telling the truth, or to refresh a witness's memory, and all documents that refer or relate to such examinations.

## VIII. Rule 404(b) Evidence

Pursuant to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Rules 403 and 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Mr. Epstein requests that the government disclose all evidence of similar crimes, wrongs, or acts, allegedly committed by Mr. Epstein (or any person alleged to have been acting pursuant to his instructions), upon which the government

intends to rely to prove motive, scheme, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, in its case-in-chief.

This request includes but is not limited to:

A. Any statement as to which Mr. Epstein allegedly manifested his adoption or belief in its truth. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B).

B. Any statement made by another which was purportedly authorized by Mr. Epstein. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C).

C. Any statement made by an agent or employee of Mr. Epstein concerning a matter within the scope of his agency or employment made during the existence of such a relationship. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).

D. Any statement made by an alleged co-conspirator of Mr. Epstein during the course and in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).

## XI. Rule 1006 Evidence

Pursuant to Rule 1006 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Mr. Epstein requests that he be advised whether the government will seek to offer any chart, summary, or calculation in evidence, and requests that all writings, recordings, or other information on which such charts, summaries, or calculations are based be made available sufficiently in advance of trial for inspection and copying.

## XII. Suppression Issues

A. As a predicate to potential motions pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 12, Mr. Epstein requests that he be informed:

EFTA00016148

August 1, 2019
Page 14
Steptoe
STEPTOE &amp; JOHNSON LLP

1. Whether the government intends to offer into evidence any statement made by Mr. Epstein or any family member, and the substance of any such statement;
2. Whether any evidence in the government’s possession, custody, or control was obtained by a search and seizure conducted by the government, and a description of such evidence;
3. Whether any evidence in the government’s possession, custody, or control was obtained through electronic or mechanical surveillance, including without limitation wiretaps, body wires, pen registers, and/or surveillance of telephone calls, and a description of such evidence;
4. Whether any evidence in the government’s possession, custody, or control was obtained through the use of a beeper or other tracking device, or subpoenas or warrants for GPS or cell tower information that would disclose Mr. Epstein’s whereabouts at any particular time, and a description of such evidence;
5. In connection with any tape recording, wiretaps, or other surveillance of Mr. Epstein during the investigation of the allegations of the Indictment or any related allegations, Mr. Epstein seeks:
a. the names and addresses of all such persons whose personal or business telephones the government tapped or monitored, or whose conversations or actions the government monitored by other means without the person’s knowledge;
b. transcripts or other records of the statements or conversations monitored;
c. the original recorded tapes created during such surveillance;
d. the procedures used to conduct such surveillance; and
e. the authority under which such surveillance was conducted.
6. Whether any evidence in the government’s possession, custody, or control was obtained through a mail cover and/or trash cover and a description of such evidence; and
7. The identities of any informant or undercover agent employed by the government during its investigation of the charges of the Indictment.

EFTA00016149

August 1, 2019

Steptoe
STEPTOS &amp; JOHNSON LLP

B. Mr. Epstein requests that the government disclose whether it intends to introduce any evidence obtained in the manner described in Section XIII.A.1-6. If the government intends to do so, Mr. Epstein requests that the government: (1) identify such evidence; (2) identify the source of the evidence; and (3) disclose any warrant and supporting affidavits related to the collection of the evidence.

## XIII. Seized Information that is Unresponsive or Subject to the Attorney-Client Privilege

It is our understanding that the government has seized materials – including computers and other portable electronics – that are likely to contain documents and information that are: (1) outside the scope of the search warrant which purportedly authorized the search (“Unresponsive Data”) and/or (2) subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and other privileges (“Privileged Data”) (collectively, “Seized Data”). As an initial matter, Mr. Epstein requests that the government produce these materials to defense counsel in their entirety. Mr. Epstein further requests that the government maintain and preserve audit logs that record what files were searched, when and by whom, and whether additional copies were made.

With respect to Unresponsive Data, Mr. Epstein requests that the Government: (1) employ search terms or other protocols to ensure that any review of irrelevant documents was limited and that irrelevant documents are promptly segregated; (2) disclose such protocols to the defense; and (3) return any non-seized documents (and the media from which they were collected) as soon as possible to Mr. Epstein. See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g).

With respect to Privileged Data, Mr. Epstein further requests that the government establish sound procedures to ensure any Privileged Data is appropriately protected, including but not limited to use of a privilege (or “taint”) team to review the documents. We are pleased to provide the privilege team a list of counsel to Mr. Epstein to aid in this review.

***

Please advise us whether the government will provide the requested information so that Mr. Epstein can determine whether it will be necessary to move for a bill of particulars or file other discovery-related motions. For any request for which there is a dispute, Mr. Epstein requests that you take all necessary steps to ensure the documents and information are preserved by their custodian.
