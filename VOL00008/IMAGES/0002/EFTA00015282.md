Nothing really to report for my cases. They're pretty hands on when it comes to [redacted], but nothing like you're describing (or [redacted]) has seemingly experienced with AMI).

To the extent anybody in this small group is willing to share, are any of you folks' teams / cases getting significant pressure from the chiefs on memos or other written product this week, whether for the brass or otherwise? I'm just curious whether it's just the Epstein case (where we're getting near-daily prodding about imminent deadlines for memos that are both extremely time-intensive and also couldn't possibly be acted upon for weeks, given the circumstances of the world) or if it's something broader in the unit. I just sent the chiefs a pretty crabby email about being bugged daily about lengthy, detailed work product and it made me wonder whether this is a trend or an isolated incident.

More importantly, hope y'all and families are all staying healthy . . .
