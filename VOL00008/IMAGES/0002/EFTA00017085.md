Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

This letter provides discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ("Fed. R. Crim. P."), and seeks reciprocal discovery.¹

Disclosure by the Government

Based on your request for discovery in this case, enclosed please find copies of the materials listed in the attached index, which materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_00000001 through SDNY_GM_00012841. If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to do so.

The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information constitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. Specifically, the Government discloses the following:

- The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule set by the Court.

¹ In addition to information provided herein, please note that this Office periodically posts content on social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Members of the public may post comments in response to the Office’s postings. We do not control these user-generated comments, nor do we monitor or regularly review such comments. You may directly access these social media platforms in the event you believe someone may have posted information relevant to this case.

# Disclosure by the Defendant

In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial.

The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

# Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility

This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court six weeks in advance of the trial.

Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S.Ct. 1376 (2012); Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012).
