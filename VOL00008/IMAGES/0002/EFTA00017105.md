Thanks for checking in on this – we expect to continue to bring in victims and witnesses in connection with the active grand jury proceedings, under the same USAO number as before ( ). Some individuals will be subject to grand jury subpoenas, and others may be meeting with us in lieu of testifying before the grand jury. We can advise if we believe we need to use USAO funds, or if other issues arise, but we can confirm we do still have an active grand jury investigation (including prospective grand jury testimony).

thanks very much,

What case am I using to bring witnesses into SDNY. I can only bring people in for GJ, pretrial, trial and sometimes pre GJ. For the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment.

If you are interviewing more people in an investigation you are going to have to travel to them.

I am not giving anyone a hard time I just need to follow the rules.

Please let me know.

Dear [Redacted],

I spoke to [Redacted] yesterday and she confirmed that she is still interested in speaking with our clients.

[Redacted] is still available to meet with prosecutors on August 26, 2019 at 12:00 p.m. in New York.

Please let me know what information you need from me to arrange flights/hotel stay for [Redacted].

Additionally, you previously mentioned that there may be counseling resources available for our clients. Could you send me that information as well?

Thank you, [Redacted].
Best,
Colleen
