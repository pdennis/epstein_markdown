Do you have a copy of the second 6(e) order from February that allowed Civil to review the additional trust agreements beyond those referenced in the order attached to Ted's email? I don't have a copy.

Thanks,

Yes. We need to apply for a new order with an application that would discuss why we need to disclose; privacy concerns; potential protective orders; should we give notice to the people we got the trust agreements from (and if not why not), etc.

This is the original order, which does seem to suggest we need "further order of the court" to further disclose.
