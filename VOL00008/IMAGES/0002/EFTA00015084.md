## Key guys,

Can you provide us with a little more information on the following witnesses. DOB's would be great or approximate age but if not maybe who they are, why they are testifying, city or state they are from? [REDACTED] is attached to this email, and she is assisting us with doing all the checks for the witnesses.

Thanks!
