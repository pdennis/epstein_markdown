Subject: Note to file - Call with Mike Monico
Date: Wed, 17 Jul 2019 20:18:47 +0000

Mike Monico and Barry Spevack called on behalf of Cohen. They asked whether we would file a Rule 35, and requested a meeting to discuss it. I asked what had changed since we told them, on April 17, that we did not intend to file such a motion. They said that Cohen “has heard Trump say things about Epstein,” but would not get into detail at this time about what those were. They then attempted to rehash our April 17 conversation about Rule 35, and asked for specifics about what Cohen had done to undermine his credibility. I said I would consider whether we were willing to provide more specifics.
