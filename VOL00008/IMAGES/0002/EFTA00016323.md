Subject: Maxwell - CapitalOne/SAKS Credit Card

Date: Mon, 22 Jun 2020 13:14:55 +0000

Attachments: Experian_8-28-19_Prod_-_G_Maxwell.pdf

Per the Maxwell's Experian report (August 2019), Maxwell has an open CapitalOne/SAKS credit card (account number [redacted]). Per the Experian report, as of the 8/15/19 the card had a zero balance and the last payment made on the card was in May of 2019. I have attached the Experian report for your reference.

I am preparing a summary of Maxwell's credit cards. I anticipate sending out that summary either today or tomorrow.
