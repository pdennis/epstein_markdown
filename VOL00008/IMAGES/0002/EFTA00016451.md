Last month, the 11th Circuit, in a case arising from the failure to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, decided that rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (the "CVRA") "do not attach until criminal proceedings have been initiated against a defendant, either by complaint, information, or indictment." In re Wild, 955 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir. 2020). Accordingly, "[b]ecause the government never filed charges or otherwise commenced criminal proceedings against Epstein," but simply entered into a non-prosecution agreement with him, "the CVRA was never triggered."
