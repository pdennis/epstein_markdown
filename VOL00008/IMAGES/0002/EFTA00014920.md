Attached is the corrected SW binder, which FBI informs me they are comfortable with. The only difference from the last binder I sent you is to change the date and time that the cell site simulator revealed that the phone is located at the subject premises from last night at 10:15pm to this morning at 7:36am. This should be ready to swear out as soon as the Judge is available.

Thanks,
