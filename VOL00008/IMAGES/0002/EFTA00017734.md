Just a heads up that we are unsealing an indictment this morning against Ghislane Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, charging her with facilitating his abuse of minors. She was arrested in New Hampshire this morning, so the presentment will not be in SDNY. She will not appear in SDNY today. Let me know if you have any issues.
