Enclosed with this letter is an encrypted file labeled DB-SDNY-PROD011 containing documents responsive to items 1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 19, 20, and 27 of the Subpoena.

- List of Payees of LSJE, LLC Account: Supplemental Exhibit B provides background information on the recipients of payments from an Epstein-controlled account, LSJE, LLC. KYC records indicate that Epstein planned to use the LSJE account as a “[c]hecking account for the daily expenses associated with running one of Jeffrey Epstein’s private homes.” KYC records do not specify which private home. The transactions reflected in Exhibit B suggest that LSJE was used, at least in part, to manage Epstein’s Palm Beach estate.
- Butterfly Trust Account Transactions: Supplemental Exhibit C identifies all incoming and outgoing transactions involving the Butterfly Trust money market account.
- Timeline of Active/Capitalized Accounts: Supplemental Exhibit D provides a timeline of the openings and closings of Epstein’s capitalized Wealth Management accounts.
- Payments to Certain Beneficiaries of the 2013 Butterfly Trust: Supplemental Exhibit E identifies payments to or on behalf of certain beneficiaries of the 2013 Butterfly Trust, as well as their family members. The Bank did not open an account for this entity, but received trust documents in the course of its due diligence on a separate Epstein-settled trust, “The 2017 Caterpillar Trust.” The Bank previously briefed the SDNY on payments to the majority of the beneficiaries of the 2013 Butterfly Trust, with the exceptions being [redacted], and Supplemental Exhibit E contains this additional information.

The decryption password for the production will be provided by separate email. As we have discussed, we continue to collect relevant information related to the Subpoena, and expect to make additional productions shortly.
