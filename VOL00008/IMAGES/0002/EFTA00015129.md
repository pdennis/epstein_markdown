Good morning-

If by 9:30 this morning (10/7) Ms. Maxwell does not receive the legal mail deposited in the MDC legal mailbox on Saturday (10/2), an order to show cause will be filed with the Court.

I urge you to respond and comply immediately.

Good evening-
As of this writing, Ms. Maxwell has not received legal mail which I personally placed in the
East Building legal mailbox on Saturday, October 2. On that same day, in that same mailbox,
I deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building. That client confirmed that he received his legal mail.
Ms. Maxwell has not.

Please explain why delivery of Ms. Maxwell’s mail has been delayed.
Time is of the essence. Her trial begins on November 29th.
Every delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare for trial.

Your prompt response is requested.
Thank you-
Bobbi
