No worries. Believe me, I sympathize. For what it's worth, I turned on "Wi-Fi Calling" in my Settings and it made a huge difference.

Ok. Sorry to miss the calls. Have been working in basement for last couple hours where I get no cell service.

I would have reached out to them directly if I didn't share the concern. With your confirmation as reinforcement, I called her back and she completely agrees that and have got it covered.

I didn't ask because I thought it was honestly heavy handed. You really think we should?

just called (she'd tried you first since it was Maxwell). She'd like us (you and me) to have eyes on the draft if possible before it's filed. Think you can swing that with and ?

FYI, BOP is not moving her to general population as requested in the motion, and our response will argue that the court should defer to the BOP and its determination as to what is necessary, but the team has been working

with the BOP to increase her computer/discovery access, which was the principal way she argued she was being impacted by her restrictive conditions.

I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)
