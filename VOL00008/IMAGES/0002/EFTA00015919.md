I am generating the load files for such stuff as we speak. Apologies for the delays, this is a long and complex process that I had to come up with a procedure for. I anticipate the files being ready by the Thursday COB. If you could forward a drive to me to copy the files onto, I would appreciate it.

Wanted to follow up on our phone conversation from about six weeks ago – I think we had anticipated that the electronic evidence that was being processed by CART from the New York residence search (which I believe was whittled down to approximately 5-6 iMacs and 5 laptop computers) would be completed for upload with load files for Relativity sometime in late October. We're concerned about timing particularly because I think that's just the tip of the iceberg – I don't think FBI has even started on the island materials, for example – so wanted to check on timing. Could you please let us know what the status is of those materials, and also what the materials are from the island that need to be processed, and whether there's an estimated time of completion for those as well?

thanks very much,
