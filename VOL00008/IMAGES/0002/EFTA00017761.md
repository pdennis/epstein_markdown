Hi

Not a problem. I will add them to the list. Do you have everyone's titles?

Thank you.

If it is not too much of an imposition, we ask that all visitors come to our front lobby for screening before admission. Thanks!

Hi

It should not be a problem. Does 10 am work for Mr. Berman and the rest of his staff?

The list of visitors from our office is below:

As discussed, we would like to see the 2nd floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9th floor SHU, and Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3rd floor bridge.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
