Hi _______________________________________________________________,

Thanks very much for speaking today. We have incorporated our discussion into the attached letter to Judge Nathan. Would you please review the draft and let us know if there are any inaccuracies in it? I highlighted one sentence in particular for your attention, but please review the entire letter closely. As we mentioned earlier, our letter is due today as soon as possible, no later than 5 pm.

Thanks,
☐

Hi _______________________________________________________________ and _______________________________________________________________.

Maxwell's counsel filed the attached letter last night, and we've been ordered to respond as soon as possible, and by no later than 5 pm. Is one of you free soon for a call about this?

Thanks,
