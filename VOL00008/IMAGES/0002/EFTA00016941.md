No problem -- just sent an application off to court. It should come back by the end of the week.

Subject: Maxwell ______________ account

Hey all,

We received statements from USAA and Maxwell has an ______________ account. Can we get a subpoena and NDO for ______________? Looks like she has made quite a few transactions from there and we'd like to see where her packages are going right now. The credit card she was using for purchases is under the name Ghislaine Borgerson.

Identifiers:
Ghislaine Maxwell and/or Ghislaine Borgerson

Thanks,
