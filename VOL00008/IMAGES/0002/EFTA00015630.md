Hi Ray,

There are no changes to the plea agreement I sent on Wednesday, 7/3 -- attached again here. And the Magistrate Court sent an email yesterday scheduling the plea for tomorrow (Wednesday, July 10) at 11:30 a.m. (their email was sent at 10:18 a.m. yesterday). So we're on for tomorrow, 11:30 a.m. at the Magistrate's Court in 5A, and should be all set.

thanks,

---
