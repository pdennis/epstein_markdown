Subject: [EXTERNAL] US v Maxwell - press query

Date: Wed, 20 Oct 2021 13:49:49 +0000

Hello all,

I am a journalist with the Press Association in London.

Is there anyone who might be able to outline whether the trial of US v Ghislaine Maxwell is due to open, as planned, on November 29 please?

Also looking to try and find out whether the defendant is due to give evidence, and how long the trial is listed for.

Have had no joy getting hold of anyone at the court (212 637 2600).

Apologies – I am sure you have had several of these requests. Please let me know if there is a better person to contact.

Best

Ryan Hooper
