Thanks very much, that's great news. I'll let the team know and ask them to hold off until next week to touch base.

Have a great weekend.

Just following up from our last conversation. [redacted] will be assigned on a full time basis to the Epstein case until further notice and [redacted] will be helping out on a part time basis. Please hold off on having anyone from SDNY reach out to them until next week so [redacted] has time to get them briefed. Their contact information is below. Any questions let me know. Have a good weekend.

Thanks
