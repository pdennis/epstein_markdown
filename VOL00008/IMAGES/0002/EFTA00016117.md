Hi [REDACTED] – the severed half of Carl Andrews’s case is scheduled for trial in mid-February, and lawyers for one of the defendants in that coming trial have just filed a letter (attached) arguing their client, Justin Rivera, is receiving insufficient access to discovery at MCC when compared to the access to discovery Maxwell is getting at MDC (see page 4).

Do you have a few minutes to chat before tomorrow at 10:30am (when we next appear before PAE) regarding Maxwell’s access? I’m aware of the obvious differences in institutions (MDC is larger and has more space than MCC) and particular units (the women’s unit at MDC being viewed as particularly spacious with its own library, I think) -- and how these differences probably allow for Maxwell to have substantially more access than a male inmate at MCC.
