Following up on this, in connection with the L.A. trip, could you please book me on the following flights:

Feb. 25, Delta, JFK to LAX, 11:40 a.m. (arriving 3:12 p.m.)

Feb. 28, Delta, LAX to JFK, 11:55 p.m. (arriving Feb. 29, 8:25 a.m.)

And as referenced below, I made a hotel reservation at a Hilton, for the same trip. And we'll need a conference room there for Wednesday, February 26, from approximately 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. (or all day if that's the way they do it).

thanks,

, just FYI, in connection with this trip to Los Angeles, I just made a reservation for a hotel on E2 (see attached) – if I did anything wrong, it can be changed, but it's a hotel that is almost never available for us so I wanted to make the reservation tonight just in case. And will follow up with flights in the coming days. Happy to chat if that's useful, and thanks very much.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for three interviews in Los Angeles on February 26, 27, and 28 (we have at least one interview on each of those days). We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 25th to the 29th. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those dates (the 26th).

thank you,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th (overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on our formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days at a hotel for the interview itself.

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on that.

thank you,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
