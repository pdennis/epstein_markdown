Here's the final version of the briefing book for tomorrow. The only addition is the other attachment here, reflecting our charging stats from last year and this year to illustrate the COVID impact (and our productivity despite it). These are all in the hard copy binder. Good luck tomorrow—please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help you prepare.
