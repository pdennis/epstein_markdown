Hi Joe,

Hope the storm missed you this week, and that you and your client are doing okay.

Our team is working out some scheduling issues today, and we should know more by this afternoon. I’ll plan to reach out then to discuss scheduling, if that’s okay.

Thanks,

Good morning,

Just wanted to check in to see if you still planned to travel south given the storm. Current estimates show a landing (somewhere) Tuesday with very bad weather on Wednesday. Airports might close (which will answer my question), but that’s a guess.

Following up on scheduling, we were wondering if your client is available for a proffer on September 4th. We're flexible on timing that day, but we would propose meeting at 12:30 p.m., if that works.

Hi,

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will work around it.

Thanks,

I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does . September is a busy month with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I will do everything to be as flexible as possible.

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion.
