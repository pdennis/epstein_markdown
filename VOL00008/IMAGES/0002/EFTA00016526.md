Hi

I've reviewed the search and confirmed that those documents should all be marked Non-Responsive and locked off from being accessed.

I am fine with the Non-Responsive data being placed in subfolders as you suggest, as long as all of the Non-Responsive documents are locked off from review.

Thanks very much,

From: (USANYS) [Contractor] &lt;

Hello

Can you please confirm that the below search is the correct data to secure:

US v. Epstein (SW Returns) - Potentially Non-Responsive - https://d1pe.nss.pae.com/Relativity/go?id=2370462-4350955

Can you also please confirm that the Potentially Non-Responsive data will be placed in two subfolders under the following parent folders:

Now that we have completed our responsiveness review in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database, we need to lock off access to any non-responsive materials in that database. Would it be possible to please lock off access to the 397,365 documents in that database that are NOT currently tagged "Identified Responsive"? That should leave just the 1,218,719 documents that are tagged "Identified Responsive" accessible to the team for use in our case.

Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be useful.

Thanks very much,
