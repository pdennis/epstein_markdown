FBI Florida wants us to obtain the consent of SDLF for FBI to turn over to us all the grand jury materials they have from the original Epstein case (we already obtained some files without them raising this issue, but now they have). Sharing grand jury material between different federal grand juries is specifically approved in Rule 6(e), and we have done this before with a letter acknowledgement, so this shouldn't be an issue.

The question is whether we should have [redacted] contact their crim chief on this issue (since the last contact was Lisa to the crim chief), or have ODAG coordinate. Let us know what you think?
