Well this is all baffling but I really appreciate knowing it's not just Epstein. Thanks guys.

I got a deadline of next week for a memo the timing of which has no possible significance and for which, I told them, some additional things we are working on that cannot be completed by next week could be important.

Yeah suddenly an AMI pros memo became very urgent last week.

To the extent anybody in this small group is willing to share, are any of you folks' teams / cases getting significant pressure from the chiefs on memos or other written product this week, whether for the brass or otherwise? I'm just curious whether it's just the Epstein case (where we're getting near-daily prodding about imminent deadlines for memos that are both extremely time-intensive and also couldn't possibly be acted upon for weeks, given the circumstances of the world) or if it's something broader in the unit. I just sent the chiefs a pretty crabby email about being bugged daily about lengthy, detailed work product and it made me wonder whether this is a trend or an isolated incident.

More importantly, hope y'all and families are all staying healthy . . .
