Yeah, that's what all this week's fighting with Boies has been about. The Circuit has now given them until the 20th to brief it, I think, so we can ask Boies about this in advance, but the documents have victim names redacted, for example --

https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=7011492 Deposition-May-2016

That redacts name, for example.

Though it wouldn't be new information that was approached by Epstein and Maxwell and interacted with them, given comments to the press previously.

I didn't realize Maxwell's deposition is being unsealed in the litigation before Judge Preska. Is that right? I saw an article suggesting that will be released in the batch of documents, but wasn't sure. is named in it, obviously, so that raises concerns about victim confidentiality.
