## Hatescape: An In-Depth Analysis of Extremism and Hate Speech on TikTok

Institute for Strategic Dialogue (24 August 2021) TikTok is now one of the world’s leading social media platforms, used by millions daily to create videos that are stylish, eye-catching and technically impressive and that inspire others to join in. The platform’s videos give rise to countless viral trends across online platforms, with content spread across other social media sites. But TikTok is also popular with those intent on using online spaces to produce, post and promote hate and extremism. Academic research and news investigations have reported on the problematic side of TikTok, but there is still a significant knowledge gap on how unique aspects of the platform are used at scale to direct hatred at others. ISD set out to examine the state of hate on TikTok in two ways. The first objective involved analysing how individuals or groups promote hateful ideologies and target people on the platform based on numerous protected attributes such as ethnicity, religion, gender or others. The second objective involved using the same framework but investigating how features on TikTok like profiles, hashtags, share functions, video effects and music are used to spread hate.

Extremist groups 'actively recruiting' military and police, Canadian intelligence report warns

## U.S. officials provided Taliban with names of Americans, Afghan allies to evacuate

"Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list," said one defense official.

U.S. officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies to grant entry into the militant-controlled outer perimeter of the city's airport, a choice that's prompted outrage behind the scenes from lawmakers and military officials. The move, detailed to POLITICO by three U.S. and congressional officials, was designed to expedite the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan as chaos erupted in Afghanistan's capital city last week after the Taliban seized control of the country. It also came as the Biden administration has been relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport... But the decision to provide specific names to the Taliban, which has a history of brutally murdering Afghans who collaborated with the U.S. and other coalition forces during the conflict, has angered lawmakers and military officials...

Islamic State pours scorn on Taliban victory in Afghanistan while experts warn of 'new phase of jihad'
David Rose, Beirut, The Times (London), Friday August 20 2021, 12.00pm BST,
https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/islamic-state-pours-scorn-on-taliban-victory-in-afghanistan-while-experts-warn-of-new-phase-of-jihad-3v72qg3dq

Islamic State has poured scorn on the Taliban's victory in Afghanistan, claiming that its Islamist rival had merely been handed the country by the withdrawal of American troops. In its first comment since the Taliban's takeover in Kabul, the terrorist group declared that the Afghan movement had not fought a true "jihad" — or holy war — and expressed doubt that it could implement true sharia law in Afghanistan. It also mocked "the new Taliban" as a tool "in the guise of Islam", which would be used by the US to mislead Muslims and to fight Islamic State's own presence in the region. The comments came in an editorial in the group's al-Naba newspaper, which is disseminated online via encrypted messaging apps, despite efforts to suppress it, and is considered a mouthpiece for the group's leaders. "It is a victory for peace, not for Islam; [a victory] for negotiations, not jihad," the editorial published yesterday said, referring to the Taliban's takeover. Analysts said that Isis militants were "jealous" of their ideological rivals' success, but also noted the group's warning that it could stage a "new phase of jihad" in response, including in Afghanistan...

## What We Know About The Kabul Airport Attack That Killed US Troops [ABC News]

- An explosion that killed at least 13 U.S. service members in Afghanistan Thursday [Aug. 26] was part of a "complex" attack near the Kabul airport, the Pentagon said.
- Two ISIS suicide bombers detonated in the vicinity of both the Kabul airport's Abbey Gate and the adjacent Baron Hotel, according to Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command.
- The U.S. service members killed included 10 Marines, one Army, one to be determined and one Navy hospital corpsman, or medic. A 13th service member injured in the attack later died.

## After Decades Of War, ISIS And Al Qaeda Can Still Wreak Havoc [New York Times]

- The twin suicide bombings near the Kabul airport on Thursday [Aug. 26] underscored the devastating power these groups still have to inflict mass casualties in spite of the American effort.
- And they raised haunting questions about whether the Taliban can live up to the central promise they made when the Trump administration agreed in early 2020 to withdraw American forces from the country — that Afghanistan would no longer be a staging ground for attacks against the United States and its allies.
- The Taliban's lightning takeover of the country hardly assures that all militants in Afghanistan are under their control. To the contrary, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan — known as Islamic State Khorasan or ISIS-K — is a bitter, albeit much smaller, rival that has carried out dozens of attacks in Afghanistan this year [2021] against civilians, officials and the Taliban themselves.

## The Taliban Are Far Closer to the Islamic State Than They Claim – Foreign Policy (26 August 2021)

In an early sign of Afghanistan's dystopian future as well as a reminder of its dark past, a coordinated suicide attack hit several locations in Kabul, including a hotel and the airport. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds injured, including Afghan civilians attempting to leave the country and the U.S. soldiers overseeing the evacuation. Islamic State-Khorasan has taken responsibility, but the Taliban faction partially in control of security in Kabul over the past several days, the Haqqani network, must also be scrutinized. Ultimately, the attack strategically benefits the Haqqani as it will likely speed up foreign departures and prevent the prospect of further evacuations. There have been repeated warnings of a potential airport attack over the last week. When

EFTA00015650

it came, it was not spontaneous or random but a well-planned assault, using multiple bombs and targets calculated to achieve several objectives. The first and most obvious goal was to kill fleeing Afghans and discourage others from attempting to leave via the airport—or to close the airport itself. But another goal was the death of coalition troops, thus using the specter of terror to ensure the West stuck to the agreed on Aug. 31 deadline to leave the country. The timing of the attack, on the cusp of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, sends out a powerful signal to other jihadists.

## In Taliban-Ruled Afghanistan, Al Qaeda-Linked Haqqani Network Rises to Power

Haqqani network's new prominence undermines Taliban's claims of severing terrorist ties

By Sune Engel Rasmussen and Nancy A. Youssef, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 26, 2021 11:00 am ET

https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-taliban-ruled-afghanistan-al-qaeda-linked-haqqani-network-rises-to-power-11629990056?st=501q0ng6qhosyy9&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink

After taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban has pledged to be a responsible member of the international community that doesn't pose a threat to any country's security. However, the Islamist movement's victory in Afghanistan has elevated its most radical and violent branch, the Haqqani network. Having perpetrated some of the deadliest attacks of the 20-year war, the network—unlike the broader Taliban—has been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. since 2012. Closely linked to al Qaeda, the network also has for decades been involved in the hostage-taking of Westerners, and currently holds at least one American citizen captive, according to U.S. officials. "I do not believe that anyone in the West fully understands the reach of the Haqqani network," said retired Lt. Gen. Michael K. Nagata, a former director of strategy for the National Counterterrorism Center. "It is the single most impressive nonstate militant group I have ever seen, with the exception of ISIS in the first two years of the caliphate."

## Who are Isis-K, the new threat on Afghan horizon?

Military planners are warning that the chaos in Afghanistan could give rise to a separate and more extreme threat than even the Taliban, as the regional arm of Islamic State seeks to strengthen its position. Isis-K, or the Islamic State of Khorasan, is an affiliate of the group that overran large parts of Syria and Iraq to establish a so-called "caliphate". Isis-K, established in eastern Afghanistan in 2015, is a sworn enemy of the Taliban and the two groups have clashed repeatedly. It was initially drawn largely from fighters of the Pakistani Taliban, not the Afghan group, but has raided the Afghan Taliban's ranks too. Khorasan is a traditional name for the Central Asian and South Asian area that Afghanistan is part of, similar to the name al-Sham that the group used to refer to the Levant. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, whose focus remains on Afghanistan, Isis-K has repeatedly articulated its desire to attack the United Nations and western powers. While its strength is focused in the provinces bordering Pakistan, the source of present concern about the group is its ability to strike the capital, Kabul, as it has before with suicide bombings...

EFTA00015651

WASHINGTON—The Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. military are conducting extraction operations to evacuate Americans using helicopters and ground troops as the window begins to close for rescuing all people at risk in Afghanistan. The CIA has launched clandestine operations to rescue Americans in and outside Kabul in recent days, according to U.S. and other officials. The missions are using American military helicopters but under the control of the CIA, a typical arrangement in such operations. A congressional source knowledgeable about the evacuation effort said U.S. troops had gone into Kabul on joint missions with other foreign allies, including Britain and France, to designated locations where they had picked up citizens from all those nations, U.S. green-card holders, and Afghans who hold special visas for helping the U.S. military...

## Nigerian Government Says "Safe to Assume" Boko Haram Leader is Dead

On August 23, Nigeria's government said that it no longer has any doubts that Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, is dead.

- Reports of Shekau's death first emerged three months ago following a confrontation between Boko Haram and its rival, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the Sambisa Forest.
- Nigerian officials initially expressed skepticism about the reports.
- On August 23, Information Minister Lai Mohammed said in an interview that "our position is that he has been reported dead and he is dead."
- Mohammed cited the "instability ... and the struggle for succession," thousands of Boko Haram adherents surrendering, and "reports from the camp of Boko Haram itself" as evidence.
- A U.S. military official agreed, stating, "We think he was probably killed."

## Significant Dates in History
### August 27, 1979
## Northwest coast of Ireland
### Mountbatten Killed by IRA

**Brief Description:** On August 27, 1979, Lord Louis Mountbatten is killed when Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorists detonate a 50-pound bomb hidden on his fishing vessel Shadow V. Mountbatten, a war hero, elder statesman, and second cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was spending the day with his family in Donegal Bay off Ireland's northwest coast when the bomb exploded. Three others were killed in the attack, including Mountbatten's 14-year-old grandson, Nicholas. Later that day, an IRA bombing attack on land killed 18 British paratroopers in County Down, Northern Ireland.

The assassination of Mountbatten was the first blow struck against the British royal family by the IRA during its long terrorist campaign to drive the British out of Northern Ireland and unite it with the Republic of Ireland to the south. The attack hardened the hearts of many Brits against the IRA and convinced Margaret Thatcher's government to take a hard-line stance against the terrorist organization.

The IRA immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it detonated the bomb by remote control from the coast. It also took responsibility for the same-day bombing attack against British troops in County Down, which claimed 18 lives.

IRA member Thomas McMahon was later arrested and convicted of preparing and planting the bomb that destroyed Mountbatten's boat. A near-legend in the IRA, he was a leader of the IRA's notorious South Armagh Brigade, which killed more than 100 British soldiers. He was one of the first IRA members to be sent to Libya to train with detonators and timing devices and was an expert in explosives. Authorities believe the Mountbatten assassination was the work of many people, but McMahon was the only individual convicted. Sentenced to life in prison, he was released in 1998 along with other IRA and Unionist terrorists under a controversial provision of the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland's peace deal. McMahon claimed he had turned his back on the IRA and was becoming a carpenter.
