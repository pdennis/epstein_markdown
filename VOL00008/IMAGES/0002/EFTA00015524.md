No problem, and of course if she wants us instead we’ll reach out.

I think it’s possible she may be reaching out in connection with the death investigation—do you have a sense of what she wants? Happy to call her back in the first instance, just wanted to flag it in case you’d rather have the other team respond initially—whatever you prefer.
