Following-up on our conversation today, is the revised stipulation acceptable to the government?

Hey Chris,

Following up on our conversation today regarding the stip, would you agree to have the sentence say that the document is a "true and accurate copy of the transcript of one witness's trial testimony, but not the full trial transcript, given on February 26 . . .?"? If so, we are fine with the stip – and, of course, happy to consider other language that makes the same point.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney Southern District of New York
