Good afternoon!

I have been advised to forward you the attached correspondence from Arlan Ettinger, President of Guernsey's Auctioneers &amp; Brokers. The letter is regarding the property of the late Jeffrey Epstein. As advised by Nathaniel Gamble II from ODAG (see email attached), this has been assigned to USAO-SDNY for handling. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best,
