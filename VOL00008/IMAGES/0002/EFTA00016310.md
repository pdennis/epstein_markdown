Driving to go pick _______________. Attached is as far as I got with the MTD. If you're able to turn to this now, that would be great. I should be back online in a couple hours and can take it back from you then. Thanks!

No problem—I’ve gone ahead and started on the MTD. Will work on it for the next hour or so, then send to you to pick up.

Hi! I ended up just blocking off today to do this (____ is gone for the day), so I haven’t gotten anywhere yet (sorry about that) but am hopeful to knock this out today. Do you want to split topics, as we discussed, and merge later? Happy to do this any way that works.

Hey—have you started a draft of either document? I’m diving in now, so happy to pickup wherever you left off, or get them started if you haven’t had the chance.
