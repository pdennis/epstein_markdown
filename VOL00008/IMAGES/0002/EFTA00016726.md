Counsel:

The Court is currently in the process of planning logistics for the October 21 teleconference and the in-person November 1 pretrial conference.

The Court requests that each party provide their best and current estimate of the number of case related participants who will attend each proceeding (including attorneys, paralegals, victims, and family members). Please provide this information via email no later than Friday, October 15 at 10:30 a.m.

The Court also requires additional information specific to each conference.

For the October 21 teleconference, the Court will docket a public access dial-in number. There will be a separate dial-in line for party participants to ensure access. Please provide the telephone numbers of the attorneys, and any victims and Defendant family members who will attend. Also please specify the name and number of those who plan to speak during the conference so that they can be unmuted. Bear in mind that Judge Nathan will enforce a one attorney speaking per issue rule.

EFTA00016727

For the November 1 in-person conference, the District Executive's Office requires counsel to provide the number of people who plan to attend for their party (including attorneys, paralegals, victims, and family members) and the vaccination status of each person. This will help the Court plan in accordance with the District's COVID-19 protocols.

Please provide the conference-specific information via email as soon as possible but no later than Monday, October 18 for the information regarding the October 21 teleconference, and no later than Friday, October 22 for the information regarding the November 1 conference.

Sincerely,
Chambers of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan
