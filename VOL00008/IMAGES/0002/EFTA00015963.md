Looking forward to being in touch tomorrow morning, and thanks again.

Jack, Mike,

Thanks very much again for being in touch, and for your assistance with this progress. We will send information to log in via WebEx, our video conference program, which is secure and has worked well for us so far. The only thing we need is the email address or any other attendees, so I'm going to include the following email addresses (realizing that you likely will not log on using all of them), but please let us know if you need us to include any other email addresses for logging on:

[REDACTED]

And please let us know if either of you would like to chat tomorrow in advance of the discussion, otherwise we'll look forward to seeing you electronically on Friday at 9:30.

thanks,

[REDACTED]

I am confirming Friday 7/17/20 at 9:30AM for [REDACTED] to be at your office.
I will pick her up and bring her.
I assume you have video conference abilities in your office, and we of course will bring masks and social distance.
Please advise if any problems.
