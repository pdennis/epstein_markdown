Re: United States vs. Jeffrey Epstein [19 Cr. 490 (RMB)]

Dear Ms.

Enclosed, please find a photograph I believe may be of Jeffrey Epstein with an underage female.

I took the photo across from St. Patrick's Cathedral, on the same corner as the couple. I took the photo because the woman seemed to be underage and seemed romantically linked to the older man.

The pair were walking closely together - he was holding a small Victoria's Secret boutique bag in his hand. I was concerned for the well-being of the girl. To me, she seemed to be between fourteen and sixteen years of age.

At the time I took the photo, I had not heard of Jeffrey Epstein. On the following Monday, I read about Mr. Epstein's arrest. I am submitting it for your own analysis and review.

The photo was taken on the corner of E51st St and 5th Ave at Olympic Tower on 7 June 2019 at 6:46PM.

I hope it may be of help - also in ending trafficking and abuse, especially as pertains to minors. I apologise for the delay in submitting it - I was unsure of where to send it.

Sincerely,

M. Rachel Zabala
