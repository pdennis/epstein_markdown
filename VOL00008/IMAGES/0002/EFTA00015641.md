Subject: Attempted MAXWELL Visit

On April 22, 2021, the USMS received a notification from the MDC informing us that an individual identified as Enver Ruci attempted to visit Ghislaine Maxwell. According to the officer, Ruci stated that he wanted a legal visit with MAXWELL and filled out a visitor form that is normally reserved for official legal visitors. The officer did not allow Ruci to visit and informed him that she had no information on the individual that he was looking to visit with. The following information was obtained from Enver's New York State driver's license:

Ruci Enver, Address: , Staten Island, New York,
