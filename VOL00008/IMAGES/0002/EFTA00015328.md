If it touches on that case, it needs to go through them.

Thank you for being in touch, and for your assistance to Ms. —and also thank you to for assisting and facilitating. I’ve spoken with the human trafficking coordinator in our office, who is our point person for these types of circumstances and I’m copying her so she can reach out to you directly. My general understanding is that we are very limited in our ability to affect immigration processes in particular, and that ordinarily it would go through law enforcement and/or the normal visa process, and it sounds like those are perhaps in progress, but will know much better than I whether there are applicable exceptions to the normal prohibitions on our direct involvement.

Thank you again for contacting us, and I certainly hope for a positive outcome for Ms.

Respectfully,

Dear Mr. __________ -

We reach out to you at the suggestion of __________ who we understand has been in touch with you about our client, __________ sex trafficking in __________ the United States, and Canada, and who appears to have information relevant to the Epstein investigation and other sex trafficking crimes in the U.S. and elsewhere.

We need immediate assistance obtaining entry into the U.S. for __________, and others. As part of this trafficking, there is pictorial and other evidence that __________ at approximately age five in a NYC location that may have been 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan, Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion.

__________

similar perpetrators, stories and wounds to a large group of very young children, some of whom are American, studied by Dr. __________ for many years. They all appear to be part of a powerful, violent child sex trafficking ring in __________ the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere.

For the last several months, Dr. __________ and attorneys with the Marsh Law Firm PLLC have sought assistance from law enforcement without success. Dr. __________ repeatedly left tips on the FBI hotline, and briefly spoke with NYPD Detective __________ from the Epstein SDNY Taskforce. Dr. __________ talked with several FBI agents as well as agents from Homeland Security, making images available to them. She was advised that they had enough information, did not want further information, and would be back to her.

enforcement.

One of the photos depicts the __________ a child in or about 1997, __________ in a room with a blue couch and a window facing the street. While the image outside the window is blurry, it appears to be consistent with the view from an upper floor room at the front of Epstein’s mansion, which overlooks the Frick Museum across 71st Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues. __________ provided other information evidencing that she was __________ Epstein’s mansion -- she has said that the house was "big", was owned by a "rich" man, was located at "9 71", had a large, arched front door topped by a scary man's face and flanked on either side by women's faces, had a large, adult doll on a chandelier inside the house, had photos of what looked like important people around the house, and contained many bedrooms. The "bigger girls" were placed in other bedrooms. __________ hearing the

names "Jeffrey", "____", "______", "____", and others during her time at the house. Presumably law enforcement would be able to sharpen the image to determine whether the room overlooked the Frick Museum, and compare the information she has provided with the information known about the features and contents of Epstein's mansion and the perpetrators, to help determine whether she was

with law enforcement, Dr. has received substantial evidence, including the photograph described above, written communications from names of other traffickers at Epstein's mansion, photographs of the names of perpetrators pictured in some of the photographs, current phone numbers of perpetrators who communicated and conversations with perpetrators.

We beseech you to do whatever you can to help in order to enable us to deliver such information to law enforcement.

Sincerely,

Marsh Law Firm PLLC
