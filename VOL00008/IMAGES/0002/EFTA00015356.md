It's tough to be more precise until we pin down a venue, but what do you think about a little more specificity regarding protocols as a placeholder, e.g.: MANDATORY COVID-19 SAFETY PROTOCOLS WILL BE IN PLACE. INCLUDING MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. We can add some more language once we know if it'll be here or to reflect any other relevant particulars.

As an update on arrest timing, the latest thinking is that tomorrow remains possible but that we may well be pushing to Thursday. We'll of course keep you posted.

Thanks very much, Looping in and Please do keep exploring the option. If it's doable it might beat out our lobby—definitely seems like a stronger visual. On that note, if it was possible for one of you to take Audrey on a walk-through of as we figure it out, she'd appreciate it.

Wait, I thought we were now targeting the lobby of . I just got off the phone with from the FBI press office, inquiring about the logistics of that. I think they can get chairs for press, check with GSA on their Covid protocols (capacity, etc.), provide a "step-and-repeat" (a portable background with "FBI" and their seal) to reduce glare from the windows on the Duane Street side. The concerns are the acoustics (as you know, that space is cavernous, with all hard surfaces and a high ceiling) and their lack of a podium (so we'd have to lug ours over there). Is our lobby preferable? I can call back and call off the dogs.

The International Court of Trade has said no, so it looks like we're likely at Plan B (Plan Z?) option of using our whole lobby space in an effort to create some social distance.

With apologies for adding to your full plate, Audrey asked if you could please come up with a paragraph to put at the top of tomorrow's press advisory, notifying the press of safety protocols—masks, social distancing, etc.—and asking them to please leave extra time to get into the building (which may mean we should also send out the advisory earlier than usual). I've attached our safety protocols and am cc'ing [REDACTED] (and [REDACTED]), though he's out), since I know you'll want to coordinate with them on how press screening will work. Happy of course to talk or help in any way.

Thanks!
