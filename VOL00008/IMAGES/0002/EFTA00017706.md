I cannot put this language into the letter. I can include the web page.

[ ] the way she is V/W legal adviser in EOUSA and a really nice person. I would like to see if she has added text that we can use in the letter. Is it okay that I ask her.

Good Morning,

I hope each of you had a good weekend. Please find language below that has been approved by FBI NY, VSD executive management and our OGC rep. I'm more than happy to have a call if you would like to discuss.

The FBI's Victim Services Division (VSD) is committed to providing services and support to victims of crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein. Though this particular indictment is focused on specific individuals, you are still entitled to your rights, resources, and referrals as a federal victim independent of this indictment. An overview of these services is available at www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services. If you would like to speak with a Victim Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights to victim services and referrals, please email victimservices@fbi.gov.

Thank you,

[REDACTED]

Program Manager

FBI Victim Services Division
