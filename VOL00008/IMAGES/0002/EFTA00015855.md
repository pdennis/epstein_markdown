Yes, we went with the conservative approach of pulling all the emails in the folder.

is traveling. I took a look in the folder - it looks like you pulled all of the emails for the second production, right? That seems right to me, thanks again.

Hey

Should all of the emails in the folder be pulled or just the ones found in the "Emails Epstein Investigation" folder?

Thanks,

Hi

For this folder, could you please pull the emails that are in the folder and put them in a second production folder? We'll review them later for a second wave. Thanks!
