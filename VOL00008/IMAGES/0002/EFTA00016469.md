Hi

The photo sourcing project is completed and attached.

I added 3 columns: Evidence Item #, Name of CD and Location of Item.

Thanks,

Hi

Just checking in on the photo sourcing project. Do you think you'll be able to send us that spreadsheet in the next few days?

Thanks so much for helping with this.
