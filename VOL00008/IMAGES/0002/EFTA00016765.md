Thanks you so much for catching that, letting us know, and fixing it so quickly, [REDACTED]. Really appreciate that. Please just let me know when the reproductions are ready to go, and I'll email defense counsel and the MDC.

Hi all,

I was updating the discovery index for Maxwell and unfortunately realized that seven items (two items from the 7th Production, located here; and all five PDFs from the 8th Production, located here) will have to be reproduced, as their Bates numbers were slightly incorrect (missing a digit in the middle of the bates number). I can re-stamp and update them in the shared momentarily – but my apologies that we're just now catching this!

The seven reproduced items will consist of one Excel file and six PDFs, so they'll be small enough to email to defense counsel and small enough to put on a disc to send to Maxwell at MDC. I can draft a cover letter detailing the reproduced items and their updated Bates ranges, and since I'm in the office today I can send the disc out to MDC this afternoon.

Thanks so much for your understanding!
