Complete draft attached and saved on the share. Once you have a draft of the letter, want to swap and do a final read of each other’s drafts before sending to _______________?

Updated copy is the appeals folder— it’s not great, so let me know your thoughts and how else I can help with this. I’m around all evening and have also carved out time tomorrow to make sure we are covered on this. Do you want me to draft the (short) amicus letter?

No problem—I’ve gone ahead and started on the MTD. Will work on it for the next hour or so, then send to you to pick up.

Hi! I ended up just blocking off today to do this (______ is gone for the day), so I haven’t gotten anywhere yet (sorry about that) but am hopeful to knock this out today. Do you want to split topics, as we discussed, and merge later? Happy to do this any way that works.

Hey—have you started a draft of either document? I’m diving in now, so happy to pickup wherever you left off, or get them started if you haven’t had the chance.
