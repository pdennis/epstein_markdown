has car - his driver actually took us - to Phantom. I didn't know any play could be so moving. I had seen it before but still couldn't believe it. I pulled - it was fantastic. After the play we walked around the Plaza and went home. It was so much fun.

I met by 100th and he was different than I expected - pretty cute, nice, but they didn't get along very well for at the big, which made me annoyed with him. He turned out to be pretty cool once he chilled out. His brother was 25 and we hung out with him a lot. At 1st I didn't think he was as cute as she had said but quickly found him really cute. We hung out for the 1st couple days than the 4 of us went to their cabin. We had a lot of fun - x- country skid, watched South (??????) &amp; hung out. We had to sleep in the same bed &amp; ended up talking for a really long time. I kind of wanted something to happen - but didn't know I just thought he was cute &amp; fun. I didn't see him again until Friday. We went to a club to watch some bands, to a bar &amp; then announced she was staying at Jeffreys &amp; asked to stay where I was. Secretary happy but didn't want him to think I had wanted her to do this so asked kind of upset. They left us at W. I wondered if he wanted.
