☐ -- I have previously-scheduled travel to San Francisco next Thursday for a wedding, and the way our victims have asked to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to end on Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just book the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 a.m. flight but that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any inconvenience but wanted to check – thank you!

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
