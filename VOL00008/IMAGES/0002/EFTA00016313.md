and

Are you available for a call at 10 a.m. on Monday morning? We wanted to follow up on some of the information we've been emailing about. Below are the topics we'd like to discuss—if you're able to address these topics on the call, we'd very much appreciate it.

- What current/active financial accounts are we are of for Maxwell, including credit card accounts?
- What is the connection between Maxwell and UMB bank, and what did we expect to find when we issued the subpoena?
- We issued a subpoena to  on 9/25/19 (attached). SDNY does not have returns – have you received them?
- When was the last time we ran a SAR/CTR check on Maxwell? Have there been any filings in the past year for her accounts?

Thanks,
