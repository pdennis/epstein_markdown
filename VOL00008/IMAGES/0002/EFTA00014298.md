Hi [redacted]

Are you free for a few minutes this afternoon to discuss a forfeiture question relating to a property we are hoping to forfeit in the Jeffrey Epstein case? Ted and I are available from 1 to 2, or from 2:30 to 4, if there is a window in that timeframe that works for either of you.

Thanks!
