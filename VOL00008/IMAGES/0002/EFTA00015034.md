Subject: [REDACTED] Trip to NYC

To: &lt;REDACTED&gt;

Dear [REDACTED],

It was lovely to meet you outside Kinnerton St the other day, although I think we may have met before sometime.

I am booked to come to NYC on the 15th through the 21st of October and would be delighted if there might be a place for me to stay.

Please let me know asap.

I may also be coming to Paris this weekend and wondered if team Epstein will still be there?

I can be reached by return email or on my cell

Best
