Hi - I am going to work on my presentation outline here at home. When I have it put together I will give you a call and we can go over it by phone, if that is okay with you.

P.S. Goldberger accepted the proposed change to the plea agreement, so it looks like the plea is probably going forward tomorrow unless Mr. Epstein changes his mind.
