Yeah we're one step ahead -- the Marius Fortelni who lives in Southampton says on his website that he lived for a time in Saudi Arabia, so given his nationality, the fact that the "residence" on the passport is Saudi Arabia, and the fact that the age roughly appears to match up, we asked the agents to try to confirm the DOB but also to just reach out to Mr. Fortelni and see if he has any knowledge of why a passport from his country, with his name and former residence country, might be in Jeffrey Epstein's safe and with Jeffrey Epstein's face on it.

Have an agent run the real Marius's DOB and compare to passport?
