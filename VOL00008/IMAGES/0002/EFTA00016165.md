Dear Ms. Strauss,

I applaud your arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell.

She no doubt has powerful friends, but if certain people don't have to obey the law or face its consequences because of money, power or connections, I fear we are lost.

Allowing certain people to not face the law's consequences is but a short step from targeting certain people or groups for legal harassment or trumped up imprisonment.

Without uniform enforcement of the law, laws are meaningless, our constitution is meaningless, and the freedoms we value so highly in this country would evaporate.

I wanted to thank you for your fight and sacrifice to maintain the integrity of the Southern District of New York and for your work to uphold the rule of law in the US.

Thank you for fighting for us,
Craig Hunter
