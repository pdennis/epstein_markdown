Following up on our conversation earlier this week, I wanted to write to confirm that we are requesting records in the custody and control of [redacted] relating to flights on Mr. Epstein jet(s), including but not limited to [redacted] log book(s). I expect that we will formally issue a subpoena but wanted to let you know in the first instance. We also discussed following up on the topics of how [redacted] came to work for Mr. Epstein, both in 2005 and 2015. Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

[redacted]
