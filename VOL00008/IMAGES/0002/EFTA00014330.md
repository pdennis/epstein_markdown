Reid,

No problem. Don't hesitate to be in touch prior to the hearing if that would be useful, otherwise we'll plan to see you at 10:00 and go from there.

thanks,

No problem – didn’t take it as a slight, we all just have various travel and other case obligations in the near-term and want to make sure somebody can be responsive at all times. And that also sounds helpful re: an agenda, we’ll look out for that tomorrow evening and be ready to chat on Monday at 8:00.

thanks,

Reid,

In our experience it's rarely a waste of time to talk, and we would be available on Monday morning. And we'll be in the best position to be able to talk productively if you could give us a general sense of what you'd like to address?

Also, if you could please include [redacted] and [redacted] on any communications—I know it's often convenient to just hit reply but we want to make sure we're all in the loop since parts of the team will be more and less available at various times if and when you reach out.

thanks,

To the Chambers of Judge Berman:

With apologies for the delay, attached please find a courtesy copy of the Government's reply in support of its detention memo and in opposition to the defendant's motion for bail, including exhibits, filed this afternoon in the above-captioned case. Defense counsel is copied.

I hope everyone has a good weekend.

Thank you,
