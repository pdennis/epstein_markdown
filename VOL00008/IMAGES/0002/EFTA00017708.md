An perfect, thanks – and sorry to have not run it by you two before sending, I just figured it would go through so many rounds that I figured I could incorporate any edits from you guys further down the road (once we're all done with actual important stuff). And copying in case she wants to look after the GJ stuff is finished tomorrow! I'll put these in along with whatever comes from the chiefs – and thanks in particular for catching that I accidentally swapped the maxes :)

In case it's helpful, I put a few edits to this in the attached. Thanks so much for taking the lead on it.

I imagine this will go through many rounds of edits, but just to put something down on paper with plenty of time in advance – see attached. I'll be out of pocket tonight (unless there's anything time-sensitive), but can turn edits tomorrow no problem if that's useful.

thanks,
