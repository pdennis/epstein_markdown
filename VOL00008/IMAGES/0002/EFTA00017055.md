Jeff,

As discussed, attached please find a subpoena addressed to Interlochen seeking information regarding Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Per our conversation, we understand that Interlochen will keep this request confidential.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best,
Maurene
