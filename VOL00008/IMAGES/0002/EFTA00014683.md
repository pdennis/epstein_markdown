Attached is a clean version of the stip. The only thing I changed from the version you last saw is that we now label the stip Defendant’s Trial Exhibit A.

You can email me the signed version and hand deliver it to me at the conference on Tuesday, whichever works best for you.

Thanks,

Chris

Hey Chris,

This works for us. If you send me a clean version, I’ll sign and return it to you, or I can just sign it at the conference Tuesday.

Thanks,

Following-up on our conversation today, is the revised stipulation acceptable to the government?

Hey Chris,

Following up on our conversation today regarding the stip, would you agree to have the sentence say that the document is a "true and accurate copy of the transcript of one witness's trial testimony, but not the full trial transcript, given on February 26 . . .?" If so, we are fine with the stip – and, of course, happy to consider other language that makes the same point.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
