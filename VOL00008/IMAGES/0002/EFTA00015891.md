Please let me know if there are any edits you'd like me to make, or additional information you need. hasn't reviewed this, because he's in transit, but we spoke briefly this morning to discuss what should go in the update.

&gt;&gt; is going to meet with on Monday - can you guys put together an update memo this afternoon on where we are, what we've done since the last update memo, and next steps? This just for for now, not for sending down to DC.
