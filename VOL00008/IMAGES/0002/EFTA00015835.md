Hi

Attached for review please find a draft letter responding to Maxwell's most recent complaints about the MDC. I've attached the defense letter for reference as well. Our letter is due by EOD tomorrow, so I'm simultaneously sending this draft to MDC legal counsel for her to review for accuracy.

Thanks,
