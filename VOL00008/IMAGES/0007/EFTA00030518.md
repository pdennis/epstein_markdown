Hey Maurene, not sure if you've connect with Andy or whether he has a projection on when the materials will be ready. I think we're aiming to have this produced before the conference, right?

I intend to sign the Protective Order on behalf of the Epstein defense team. You will have a scanned version by noon. Let me know when we can expect the first wave of discovery and if you can in what format it will be produced. Thanks, Marty
