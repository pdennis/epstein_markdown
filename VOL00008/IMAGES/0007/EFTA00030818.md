Attached is a quick (rough!) draft. I didn't really edit the rider, except to add a few bullet points as reminders, because I am not sure what the scope of the search we are seeking is. Can you guys review and take a crack at it? FBI has asked us to do this quickly, so if we could all focus on this for the moment, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
