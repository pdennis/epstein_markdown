Hello ______ – I am sure you are getting inundated with information but I ran across this document this morning and I thought I should provide it to you. It is similar to what ______ says she was told when she witnessed young girls coming to the NY mansion – that they were there for “modeling interviews” with Victoria Secret. It is redacted so you can’t tell who recruited her but it appears to be a female.

Good luck with everything,
Sigrid
