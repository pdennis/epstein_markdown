Subject: Report on QAnon

FYI, from the April DOJ Libraries Newsletter, "Countering QAnon: Understanding the Role of Human Trafficking in the Disinformation-Extremist Nexus."

https://polarisproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Polaris-Report-Countering-QAnon.pdf Epstein gets mentioned, starting at page nine.

This also mentions in passing that radicalized people search for QAnon merchandise to buy on the internet. Seems to me that if that is so, that is a path to follow to people doing this to make money. Not for you all, but perhaps for another Unit. Be well.
