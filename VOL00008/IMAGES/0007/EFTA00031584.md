Up to you. Seriously, Monday is wide open, so if that is preferable, we can wait. But I am here if you'd rather get it over with.

&gt; Let me know, I'm generally around. Monday is also definitely fine if that's easier. My day is wide open. Just didn't want to forget about it.

&gt; I should have a few minutes later today -- it's just a packed day. Definitely will have time on Monday.

&gt; Let me know if you have two minutes to talk about the Epstein Fund. Also around Monday if that's better.

&gt; The team has been working to set up a meeting with the EPA representative to drill down on those issues - because of the holidays, it looks like that will take place on either January 3 or 6.
