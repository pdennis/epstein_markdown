I think this is good but would delete the highlighted sentences. I agree with not engaging on footnote.

[redacted],

Attached is a draft response due today at 5 pm. We still need to send this letter to [redacted] and [redacted] at the MDC to review for accuracy. Do you think you will be able to review shortly or should I send them this draft simultaneously? We highlighted some language for your consideration about Judge Nathan's deadlines, happy to discuss. We haven't engaged with the defense's footnote 1 about the volume of the materials delivered because that is a little more complicated and we want to make sure any representations are fully accurate, but happy to discuss.

Thanks,

Thanks. (We've really got to talk to Nathan about these deadlines!)

Hi [REDACTED].

Judge Nathan just ordered us to respond to this letter as soon as possible but no later than 5 pm today. We've reached out to BOP to set up a call.

Thanks,
