Combined edits to this.

What number did we put in the release for Epstein?

Happy to discuss any. If these look okay, next version should go to [REDACTED].

I imagine this will go through many rounds of edits, but just to put something down on paper with plenty of time in advance – see attached. I’ll be out of pocket tonight (unless there’s anything time-sensitive), but can turn edits tomorrow no problem if that’s useful.

thanks,
