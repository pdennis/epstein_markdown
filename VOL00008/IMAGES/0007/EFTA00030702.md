To update you on the wire collection, we anticipate making a production next week. We are trying to confirm now, but we believe that there are only five JPMC accounts – two for Epstein and three for Maxwell – for which there is wire data. Separately, we also anticipate producing wire data for transactions related to Epstein, Maxwell, and [REDACTED] where JPMC acted as a correspondent bank.

We are also making progress on collecting other information, including account opening documents, KYC documents, and account statements. Per our earlier conversations, we are compiling this information to make a single production rather than providing it on a rolling basis.

Finally, we also understand that JPM National Subpoena Processing heard from [REDACTED] at the FBI. We called him just to say that to the extent he has questions, he can direct them to us.

Thanks,
Allison

## EXTERNAL SENDER

Anjan,

Thank you for checking in, and we look forward to receiving the update later this week. Regarding the subpoenas, I think there was one subpoena served by the FBI just a day or two before we were first in touch, dated September 3, 2019, relating to [REDACTED], and then it appears we did inadvertently let the FBI serve one after we were in touch with you, dated October 8, 2019, relating to [REDACTED]. If you’ve received any subpoenas addition to those (other than the ones we’ve already previously discussed), please let us know, and otherwise we certainly will send any additional process directly to you—apologies for any inconvenience or confusion caused by the separate service.

Thanks again, and talk soon.

Hope all is well. We expect to have an update for you later this week on the timing of the wire production and our other ongoing collection efforts. On a related note, we learned from JPMorgan's National Subpoena Processing that they received a couple subpoenas directly from the FBI, which I assume are related to the same investigation we've been discussing. For any additional subpoenas in this investigation directed to JPMorgan, could you please direct them to us? That will help us get them to the appropriate team more quickly.

Thanks,
Anjan
