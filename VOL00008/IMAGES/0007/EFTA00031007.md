As you may know IG was a prosecutor in the SDNY and I believe he wants to know if the BOP disregarded requests, directives or court orders from the prosecutors or Judge in the SDNY on the underlying case as it related to phone use.

I believe HQ wants to know if the SDNY prosecutors office or Judge had any additional requirements, requests, directives or court orders that the BOP needed to comply with that are above standard BOP policy for his phone use. Such as specific recording of phone calls made, reporting to the SDNY of when phone calls were made, to whom, discussion topics, observing or monitoring phone calls, writing memorandums of what they BOP staff may of heard.

Does "memorialize Epstein's phone calls" mean was SDNY required to keep its own log of Epstein's calls at MCC?

I just received clarification on the question that OIG HQ has regarding the underlying case. The question and clarification are below.

- In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein’s phone calls related to the underlying case? If so, were they followed?
- Did BOP need to take notes on the conversation (since it’s not recorded) or were they just required to keep a phone number log?
