We did. The difference is that the courthouse was closed. I think we would do that if it were after business hours. The question is whether the same thing applies if she is arrested at 2 p.m. today.

I just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a day or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday morning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter.

That said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early tomorrow morning.

Even 1 pm is sort of late to do a conference today. What are your thoughts about unsealing if she is arrested during business hours while our clerk's office is open, but isn't presented until tomorrow?

FYI, the presentment cut off in DNH is 1pm, and if we miss it, she'll get held in a local jail until tomorrow morning. Consistent with your views this morning, I might propose that we suggest to Audrey and the press office that if we don't have her by 1, we plan to put off the press conference until tomorrow morning, since at that point she won't be presented until tomorrow in any event.
