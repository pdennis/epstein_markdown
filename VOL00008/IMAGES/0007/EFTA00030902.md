Draft letter response attached. Let me know if you have any revisions before I send to the chiefs.

Thanks for sending, [REDACTED]. I agree with this approach, though defer to [REDACTED] if she's handling, and thanks in advance. On the last point: I do think we have a firm view that they should not be filing our discovery materials in civil cases. I don't care about the substance of these particular documents, but I think we agree that is an important aspect of the protective order to assert, both in this instance and in general, so this issue doesn't continue to crop up.

[REDACTED],

I think [REDACTED] is particularly swamped this week – can you please take the lead on whatever we're going to do with this (i.e., presumably whatever the chiefs decide)? My personal vote would be to tell them that the protective order explicitly precludes the use of criminal grand jury materials in Maxwell's civil cases, and the materials are sealed because they relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation and they should feel free to raise the issue with Nathan and we'll respond. (And I would think our response could basically be a copy-paste of the letter I wrote to Netburn.) We could also note in our response to Jeff and Laura, if we wanted to, that given their awareness of the materials, we assume they will retract the obviously false claims about government malfeasance.

All that said, I also wouldn't object if they just want to allow them to file these materials under seal; I don't think it matters hugely. If we could have resolved [REDACTED] (et al) by now, none of this would be an issue.

thanks,
