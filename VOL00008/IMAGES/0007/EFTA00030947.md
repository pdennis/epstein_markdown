Subject: Request re Ghisliane Maxwell

Date: Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:35:28 +0000

Good afternoon,

At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be ready tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming weekend, but no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that Maxwell would not receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to pick the drive up from our office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. Would that be permissible?

Thank you,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
