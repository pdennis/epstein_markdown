Talk to [REDACTED], who was checking JM policy on this. In the horse case, we did put photos in the indictment in order to use them in the press conference.

I suppose we could, but is it really necessary? Didn't we use a photo of Epstein at his press conference without having it in the indictment? The photo of them is, as you note, widely publicly available, so I don't think we could be accused of publicizing something not already out there (or any more sensational than the indictment itself).

We are thinking that photos of GM/JE (the iconic one of them together) and the locations where the abuse happened would be a good visual. To that end, can we put the photos into the indictment so there is no issue with using them at the press conference?
