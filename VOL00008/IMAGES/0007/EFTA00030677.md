Michael,

Thanks for checking in, and we hope you're doing well these days. Given the lack of significant change in terms of health and safety issues over the past few months since we last were in touch, we are fine to continue to hold in abeyance our discussion with . We continue to appreciate her willingness to speak with us, and the delay will not prejudice her at all. Should it still be impracticable to meet in person in another month or two, we may circle back on the possibility of a videoconference or phone discussion, but in the interim we have no issue with remaining on hold.

Please don't hesitate to be in touch if there are any questions or issues, or if another substantial period of time has gone by and we haven't connected, and thanks again for being in touch.

Michael,

The world has obviously changed substantially even since late last week – I know we had conveyed that we wanted to meet with [redacted] sooner rather than later, but if you and/or she has any preference at all to postpone tomorrow’s meeting, that would be fine. If she has a strong inclination to do the meeting and would *prefer* to do it tomorrow, please let us know and we should be able to make that work at your office, but otherwise we’re happy to touch base in the coming weeks and see what makes sense. The last thing we want to do is endanger anyone’s health or safety. Please let us know what you prefer, and we’ll go from there.

Sure, and given that timing I actually think it would be helpful to schedule two meetings, so we can be on track to get all the information we need efficiently, unless you have any objection to that. Can we put meetings on the calendar for Tuesday the 31st and Thursday the 2nd, say at 10:30 a.m. each day? Or let us know if she or you prefer different timing.

And I would just add that because we do think she may have useful information for the ongoing investigation, which continues to proceed, if her personal issues resolve – or allow for a meeting – sooner than those dates three weeks out, we would prefer to meet earlier if that becomes possible. Understand if not, but wanted to note it.

thanks,

Michael,

Wanted to get back to you, as promised – as we indicated previously, the attorney proffers we’ve received from you haven’t caused us to change our view of Ms. [REDACTED] status, and I think you’ve generally addressed the initial and follow-up questions we’ve had. I think from our perspective the next step would be to have a conversation with Ms. [REDACTED] directly, and to cover with her the same topics that we’ve addressed with you. Ordinarily we would approach a discussion like that simply by going chronologically, and asking follow-up questions as appropriate along the way, but as I’ve mentioned to you previously, if it would be useful to proceed in a different format, or to focus (or avoid) specific topics in a first meeting, I think we would generally be amenable to that. And of course as we’ve also discussed, any discussion would be completely voluntary—not just the interview overall, but any specific topic or question that she wanted to pass on, or discuss with you in the moment, etc., would be totally up to her. Please let us know what you think? We’re also happy to chat via phone if that would be helpful as well.

thanks,

Michael,

Received, thank you. This information is helpful, and as with the prior attorney proffer, does not cause us to change our view of Ms. [REDACTED] status.

We will be traveling most of this upcoming week, but I hope that we will be able to follow up with you the following week to discuss possible next steps.

Got it -- I had that down as London, rather than Paris, so that's helpful. And I should say, these questions aren't immediately time-sensitive, I just didn't want to forget to ask, since I'm reviewing the notes now.

Hi [Redacted], is away for the weekend. In our meeting I indicated that she stayed in the Paris apartment with her husband on one occasion. I will get back to you on Monday or Tuesday regarding the other questions you've asked today as well as at the meeting. Have a nice weekend

Michael,

Following up on our meeting, one additional question / clarification we have from reviewing our notes is about whether Ms. [Redacted] ever visited certain Epstein properties other than his New York mansion and the brief visit to the Palm Beach residence. I apologize if you addressed that and I missed it, but we wanted to add it to the list of

EFTA00030683</image001.jpg>

additional questions – in particular, whether she ever visited the New Mexico ranch, the Little St. James Island, the Great St. James island, and/or the Paris residence. Also, is it correct that she just visited the Palm Beach residence the one time you referenced? It's not a problem or issue if she visited any of those other locations, we just wanted to clarify one way or the other. And happy to discuss via phone if that's useful.

thank you,

Michael,

We do understand that your attorney proffer today will be preliminary, and to the best of your client's current recollection and to the best of your current understanding, and without, e.g., having been provided documents or other materials by the Government.

We also confirm that your statements will be considered to be made pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 410 and Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f), and therefore under those protections. Regarding Rule 408, we'll just note what we have for other counsel in this case and others who have made similar statements or submissions, which is that we don't take any position on the effect or application of Rule 408 in a prospective or hypothetical dispute in civil litigation, because it doesn't implicate any rights the Government would or would not have, but you can consider us advised that your position is that your statements are also covered under 408. (While our Office itself can't guarantee the protections of Rule 408 because any dispute on that issue would be beyond our purview, we are also not taking the position that we believe it does not apply.)

thank you,

From: Michael Bachner

Hi

Prior to our meeting today, I am writing to confirm that statements I make to you today are preliminary and subject to further refinement once Ms.  and I have the benefit of additional document review and refreshed recollection if necessary based upon input we may receive from your office. My statements to you are intended in hypothetical form only and in any event, we understand that the provisions of FRE 408 and 410 apply.

Please advise if my understanding is correct.

Thanks.
