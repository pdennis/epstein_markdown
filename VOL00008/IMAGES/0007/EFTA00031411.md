This is a draft letter.

Unfortunately, I do not think the DVDs will work. McAfee is problematic and skips ~300 PDFs when I try to burn it.

Thanks — would you mind sending me a zipped version please? I’ll get this out to defense counsel after — emails about the other issue. Thanks all.

&gt;&gt; , thanks very much for jumping on this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; , per my email a moment ago. It may be easiest to zip these and send that way, or otherwise to send in two emails since the total file size is large.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please anyone let me know if any issues? And thanks again to all for the quick fix.
