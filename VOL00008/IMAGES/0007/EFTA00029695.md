One of Maxwell's attorneys sent the below email. I've attached the Friday ruling that he is referring to which is not a bail order and instead relates to the conditions of confinement. As you know, he already appealed Judge Nathan's prior bail orders. (After he filed the bail appeal in the Circuit, Judge Nathan subsequently denied the defense's request for a renewed bail hearing). Does he need to file a new appeal? It's not clear to us what he is doing here. Happy to give you a call to discuss.

Thanks!

Hi

I hope this note finds you well.

Based on the court's ruling on Friday, I will be filing a renewed motion for bond in the Second Circuit. I will note the government's opposition unless you inform me that I am mistaken.

Thanks,

David
