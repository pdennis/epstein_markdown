If helpful, the attached email from our counterparts at Main and BOP lays out the BOP's understanding of and media strategy for today's production of Epstein materials to the Times. As discussed previously, we've agreed to have them to refer inquiries to us. They've also asked for guidance on timing. Thanks!

All,

FYI, [redacted] just called from Main (I believe she's still at Fed Programs). She said there was interest from the AG's Office in the release and had some questions. We talked through things, and she said she'd carry the info back. She said she or someone else from DC might follow up.

Thanks,
Steven

Morning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. She asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process questions, [redacted] and I anticipate declining to comment anyway.

Do we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a hard time hearing during the call, but my impression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks.
