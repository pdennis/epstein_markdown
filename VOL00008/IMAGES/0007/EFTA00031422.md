Hi

Just wanted to say thanks again for speaking with me about the Nader case. After extensive briefing, we received a favorable opinion in our case yesterday, which I'm attaching in case you're curious.

Thanks very much—

Hi

I'm an AUSA in the Southern District of New York, and I'm currently briefing a retroactivity issue that I believe you litigated in United States v. Nader, 19 Cr. 201 (LMB). I've read your brief in that case, and it was very helpful. Do you happen to have a few minutes this week for a brief call? It would be helpful to get your perspective on the issue, after having litigated it successfully.

Thanks very much,
