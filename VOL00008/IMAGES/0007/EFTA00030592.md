We will need to export the data from the database, but we will need to send a hard drive to the vendor as the file size of the production will be too large to place on a FTP site for download. I would also suggest getting a hard drive from counsel so you can copy the data on the hard drive. I can have the vendor start the export on Monday. Can you please see if you can get a 1 TB drive to send to PAE so they can copy the production on the drive.

Thank you.

Thanks everyone. I would like to produce all the native files—are they all bates stamped and ready to go?

Hey _________________________________________________________________________,

I leave it up to the AUSAs on your question regarding native files. The productions look good to me but I do have one question. The drive that we sent to be uploaded contained about 41,000 files. In these two productions I only see a total of about 22,000. Is that because there are some natives that couldn't be imaged and are thus not viewable on the database?

Thanks,

Hey ,

Is there a timeframe for when these materials will be uploaded? And in turn, stamped and downloaded? Maurene is looking for an update.

Thanks,

Hi

I hope you had a wonderful weekend! I was wondering if you had a chance to look over the hard drive that Brian made on Friday. Do you have any ideas for how we should best proceed for producing? Is Relativity still our best bet?

Thanks so much!

1. Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential
2. We are working on that.
3. I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can.
4. That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp them.

Thanks!

I know you want to produce these documents can you please tell me the following:

1. Will you placing a Confidential stamp on these documents?
2. What bates number do you wish to use on the documents?
3. How do you want to produce the documents (single page tiff images, database load files or PDF production).
4. Also please note that once the documents have been loaded to Relativity there is no way to run any searches for these images since they are mostly images and video.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.

Hey

We have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent to Relativity and should be ready by tomorrow. Do you want to see them first or can they go directly to PAE?

Folder/Subfolder in Relativity: US v. Epstein → FBI Case File → Images Seized During Search
