Here are the talking points documents, numbered to correspond to the sequence in which they appear in the briefing book.

A lot, when you include all the memos. Happy to combine them for you, but it strikes me that what might be most efficient is for me to forward you just the talking points documents (there are only 7), either in one word document or as individual word files--since that's what you're likely to be editing.

Of course. What's most helpful to you. Individual word documents for each part of the briefing book or everything in one word document?
