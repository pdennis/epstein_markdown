\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY

and put the disc in an envelope addressed to:

Special Agent: _____________________________________________________________
Detective: _____________________________________________________________

If it’s possible to get the disc by 11:30, we’ll give the disc to _____________________________________________________________ at the conference, or if not, if you could put the envelope with security and reply all that it’s ready, they can pick up when convenient.
