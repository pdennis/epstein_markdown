Chris,

Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload those materials right away.

Best,

Chris,

We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial responses:

1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan.

2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive if you would like to provide one for us.

3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them.

4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production.

5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them.

6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the

EFTA00029945

SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers.

7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to them.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney

Subject: Discovery Issues
, and -

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a call to discuss.

1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive?
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please advise which way you would like to proceed.
3. A number of the emails in the discovery – over 109,000 – were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the missing attachments, if they exist.
4. A number of electronic documents – over 110,000 – that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files.

EFTA00029946

5. A number of photographs – over 6500 – were produced in native format, but **do not** have a CART number and have “date created” and/or “date last modified” dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files.

6. A number of the audio/visual files – over 460 – have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). These fall into the following buckets:

a. **SDNY_GM_SUPP**: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have “date created” and “date last modified” dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files.
b. **SDNY005 (October 20, 2020 production)**: these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files.
c. **SDNY011 (November 9, 2020 production)**: these were produced in native form with load files, but do not reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files.

7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that intentional or are we missing those documents?

Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Chris
