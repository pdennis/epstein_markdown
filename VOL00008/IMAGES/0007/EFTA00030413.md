If you guys want to make any edits you like and then send to the chiefs, that's fine with me. I'm not sure when I'll be done here

Hi

Thanks so much for drafting - I think my only suggestion would be to tweak the language a little bit to make it more obvious that the language from Bobbi is a direct quote from them/ that they wrote it (and that we aren't just characterizing their view).

Thanks!

Hi - I didn't have as much time to work on this as I had hoped before I have to leave the office, but wanted to get the draft circulating. Sorry about that. Please feel free to edit as much as you like. Saved in the correspondence folder, and attached.
