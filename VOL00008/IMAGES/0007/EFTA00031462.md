Sorry I missed this. I am super annoyed. Just got out of mag court. Running home to feed the baby. But I am around later tonight or tomorrow afternoon when I come back from white plains.

&gt; I'm in the proffer and do not have the disc with me. If I'm not mistaken, may still be in NJ. If I finish up over here earlier then expected I'll ran back and grab it.

&gt; Hi all—looking forward to meeting this afternoon. If you're able to bring over a copy of the files on this case (we'll take as much stuff as possible!), we'd really appreciate it. CD or drive are both fine.

&gt; I unfortunately have calls at 4:00 and 4:30. Could we do earlier before 11:00? I'm also concerned that if the proffer ends up going late we'll be out of luck. Or I can move the 4:30 if that's preferable for everybody. Sorry about that.

&gt; 11:00 will not work for me. Me and are good for 4:00 on Thursday though. The proffer should be done by then.

&gt; Let's do Thursday, particularly since schedules seem to be tough next week. , would it make sense to meet before your proffer, so we can have a specified time? We could meet at 11:00.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thursday I have a proffer at SNDY with SA at 12:00. I can meet after that if you guys want depending on how long this proffer goes. That may be the best option for us because Monday-Wednesday of next week we may be tied up with a take down in the office.
