Yeah, we saw this on Friday and were a little frustrated not to have gotten the advance notice we had anticipated prior to them filing. We contacted counsel on Friday and he apologized and said they've been particularly busy. So, yeah. But he did send the complaint, which also has been filed on the docket, which presumably is where the Daily News found it (her attorney was surprised there was media about it, so I think they didn't cause the story). Complaint is fairly bare-bones, though it includes the Trump interaction she had with Epstein, and is attached here. No judge assigned yet.
