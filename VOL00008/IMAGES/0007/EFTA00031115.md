Sorry for the delay! Attached is our MIL briefing, which include sections seeking to preclude the defense from attacking the investigation. AJN's ruling on the issue is on pages 15 through 30 of the attached transcript.

We've been dealing with this in Maxwell. We have some briefing and a decent oral ruling from Judge Nathan on this. Will send when I'm at my desk.

Good morning all,

Anyone have briefing in response to defense counsel's efforts to call at trial numerous (here, 7) agents involved in the investigation, to varying degrees, in an effort to impeach the investigation? Something maybe akin to – you can't put the investigation on trial.

(They've provided a Touhy letter, so not looking for that).

Thank you!
