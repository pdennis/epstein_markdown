FYI, FBI’s press office got a call from NBC, saying they were hearing there was “movement” on the Epstein investigation (the reporter mentioned GM, Prince Andrew and some other things, seeming to lean toward GM but not specific). He said they weren’t running anything soon but were looking at it. FBI did not comment, and is letting their national press office know that if they get any inquiries they should refer to NY.
