Dear Judge Cott,

Attached for the Court's consideration, please find two applications for search warrants and the corresponding proposed warrants. The agent will be available tomorrow to swear out both warrants, and I am available to answer any questions that may arise. I can be reached at my desk [redacted], on my cellphone [redacted], or by email at this address.

Respectfully submitted,
