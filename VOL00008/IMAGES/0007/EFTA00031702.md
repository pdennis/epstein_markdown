If you look at the Quitclaim Deed dated 12/23/2011, see the below paragraph. The "Grantor" in 2011 is L.S.J LLC (Epstein).

I could not pull the 1998 Deed on line, but clearly, L.S.J LLC (Grantor) first received the title on 04/27/1998.

Being the same premises conveyed to Grantor by Warranty Deed dated April 27, 1998 and recorded May 15, 1998 in Book 49-T, Page 494 Doc. No. 1988 and entered in Aux 52, Page 141 in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds for St. Thomas and St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands.
