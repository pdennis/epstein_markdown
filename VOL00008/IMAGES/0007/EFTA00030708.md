Attachments: USVI_Devices_SW_v3.docx; SW_for_6_binders_v3.docx

Attached are the final versions of the two warrants we need to swear out. One is for the six binders that were incorrectly described in our prior warrant for the contents of the suitcases recovered from the New York residence. The second is for the electronic devices seized in the Virgin Islands.

Please read both of these very closely and give me a call if you see any inaccuracies or errors. Once you're signed off, let me know, and I'll send these to the Judge.

Thanks,
