These are great. Keeping in mind that we may have sensitivities about this exact wording, here’s a humbly suggested pull quote:

“Ghislaine Maxwell wasn’t a bystander. And she wasn’t just an enabler. She was a participant.”

I think with the right inflection this could be powerful. Just a thought...
