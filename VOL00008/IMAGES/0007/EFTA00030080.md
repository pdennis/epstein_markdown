You're welcome to join, and I'm adding you to the calendar invitation, but certainly no need, I can deal with this one.

Hi [Redacted]

Thanks for your guidance on this. Are you available for a follow-up call on Monday? I'm free before 10:30, if you have time in the morning.

Thanks,

I've had several dealings with [Redacted] who is pretty responsive. I don't recall having had many dealings with the other EOUSA FOIA attorneys [Redacted]ists.

Oh, sorry: our FOIA Tracking Database is designed to cover FOIA requests that are directed to our Office; it does not track FOIA requests to, e.g., the FBI, that end up in litigation in the SDNY and that our Civ Div defends.

Thanks, [redacted] could you please check your records and let us know if there are any other cases? From [redacted]'s list, it seems like at least one case is missing (there is a civil case involving a FOIA request from Radar Online).

As we just discussed:

Here is what we have in our FOIA tracking database regarding Epstein FOIAs.

And also attached is the letter in PPI about discovery vs FOIA (see p. 8)

Hi [redacted].

Hope you're doing well. [redacted] and [redacted] and I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. [redacted] suggested that you'd be the best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information:

- A list of all FOIA requests our office has received;
- For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and
- Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is.

That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.
