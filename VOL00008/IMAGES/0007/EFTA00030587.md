Hi

I have finally got through to the sergeant at Wilton Manors and he does not have any records on me ever or Ron Eppinger or the guy that I was picked up with supposedly named Charlie. It could be that they have destroyed the records being a minor or some other legality that I am not aware of but I am in dire need of that information and have hit a road block. I know this is a long shot but is there any way that you would know this information?

I can not express how sincerely apologetic I am to keep bothering you!! I am just hoping to finish what I have started and if I do... Trust me it will be well worth it in the end for so many other victims and future victims.

Thank you so much for everything you have thus far helped me!!

Kindest Regards,
