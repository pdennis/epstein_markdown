Hi

Sorry to bother you again. I just received response from CACI that no boxes were ever sent to them to be process. I just wanted to confirm that part. If so, then we assume there is no billable expense and can go ahead and close the contract?

Thanks!

Good morning

Is this document scanning service for the Maxwell/Epstein case still needed?

We haven't received any invoices from CACI, so I will also check with them.

Thanks,
