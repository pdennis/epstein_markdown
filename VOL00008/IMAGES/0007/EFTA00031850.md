Subject: RE: detention memo

Thanks very much, . This is persuasive – I read this, and I think we might have a real shot at detention. My comments and suggestions in track. Can you take a look, and unless there's stuff to discuss, can you send the next draft to the Brass, and feel free to note if you want that it is still rough/in the works, but that in the interests of giving everyone a chance to weigh in on the substance, in particular, we wanted to circulate sooner rather than later.

Hi

Attached is a draft of the memo – there may be more edits from the team, so I'll incorporate their edits along with yours later on. Thanks!
