This is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even were punitive damages to be excluded, a claim “for millions upon millions of dollars.”

Separately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: “They [the estate and/or the trustees?] have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein’s brother.” I’m wondering if you might have a recollection of what the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was in connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that information, of course—no obligation at all. And if it’s more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an email, please don’t hesitate to give a call. No emergency or rush, but did want to ask.

thanks,

From: Alex Conlon &lt;___________________________&gt;
