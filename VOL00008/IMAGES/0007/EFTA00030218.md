Hi

Hope you're doing well. In connection with the Epstein investigation, we were wondering if you could possibly send us the search warrant affidavit and order for the Epstein residence. We understand that it was executed by local authorities before the case was brought to the FBI, but we understand you have a copy in the files, and we can't seem to locate it in the materials we've reviewed. If you could please email it to us, that would be a big help.

Thanks in advance for your help, we really appreciate it.
