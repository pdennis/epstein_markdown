Thanks! I'm waiting on a few more items from that I asked her to copy for me during the physical evidence review. Once I've gotten those into the discovery folder, then I'll ask the paralegals to finalize and send out this next production.

I do not see them with the other CBP records we previously produced in August 2020, so my view is we should go ahead and produce these now.
