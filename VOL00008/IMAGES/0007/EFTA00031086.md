As a result of this new law, victims of childhood sexual abuse whose voices were never heard and whose stories were never told have now been given a new chance to come forward, to share their experiences, and to vindicate their rights, all goals wholeheartedly shared by my Office, which is committed to using the federal criminal law to the maximum extent possible to investigate and prosecute those who sexually abuse and traffic minors.

As many of you know, last year, my Office brought criminal sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, a serial predator who, over a period of years, abused dozens and potentially hundreds of young girls. To do so, we relied on the courage of many young women who were victimized as minors and who were willing -- years after their abuse -- to share their stories. And while Epstein committed suicide before he could face trial, our investigation into his co-conspirators continues.

As I have said publicly before, we can only do the work we do with the assistance of victims willing to come forward. By providing victims of childhood sexual abuse with a new opportunity to be heard, this law marks not only an important step for victims' rights but will help facilitate the work of law enforcement in identifying and prosecuting those who prey on and seek to do harm to our most vulnerable.
