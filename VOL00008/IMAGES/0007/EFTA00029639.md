Subject: Jeffrey Epstein Victim; Ms , 17 years old

I am a very close friend of Ms. and her guardian, Ms. of Calderitas, Mexico. Ms. was abused by Jeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New York and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They both have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim as a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she believes she may have a claim.

She does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to retain and attorney soon.

Regards,
