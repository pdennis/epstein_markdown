Hi

I have spoken to Mark's business support and he is available at 4.15pm (UK time) today (ie in just under an hour's time). It is quite urgent so if we could speak then it would be greatly appreciated. If that does work please let us know what number to call you on?

Many thanks

Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks, Ted
