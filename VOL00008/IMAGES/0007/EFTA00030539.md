I know this is like literally the worst night to circulate this, but if either of you happens to have an opportunity to take a glance tomorrow, I'm very happy to incorporate any thoughts / suggestions / corrections before sending up the chain – and if not, no worries at all, I'll send it up and I'm sure there will be time to weigh in after, too.

thanks,
