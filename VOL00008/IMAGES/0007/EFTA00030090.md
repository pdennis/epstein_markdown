Counsel,

Pursuant to the Court's Order dated November 18, 2020, today we are producing materials regarding victims who are not referenced in Indictment number 51 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production is small enough to produce via an FTP site. Would you please send us a link to use for this production?

We will send a CD containing a copy of this production to the MDC for your client to review as well.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
