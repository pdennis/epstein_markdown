Subject: MCC NY Epstein Investigation

I work at MCC NY. I was working the rear gate area when the gate pass inmate named _________________________ brought back to the gate bays of shredded papers to throw out into the dumpster on Thursday and one bag on Friday. He stated that members of the BOP after action team that were investigating what happened with the Epstein suicide were shredding boxes of paperwork. He stated, "they are shredding everything". He stated that he even was told to help them shred paperwork too. I believe that this conduct maybe inappropriate for a investigative team to be shredding paperwork related to the investigation and you may want to investigate why BOP employees were destroying records.
