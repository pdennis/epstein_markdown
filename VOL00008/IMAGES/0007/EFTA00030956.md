This is a super rough pros memo.

Basically, what can he tell us about the 7/23 attempt, and what can he tell us about Officer Thomas, Noel, and Lt. (Af. Am. Female overnight lt). Photos of officers attached.

Thanks. Can you also send your interview outline and/or draft pros memo so that I can make sure I ask everything you need?
