Would you like this labeled?

Hey [REDACTED], could I please ask for your help with printing some documents? If I could please get the five docs in the following folder:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\ [REDACTED]

printed single-sided, black and white, in a binder, that would be great. It's roughly 550 pages total, I think. And if I could please get tabs with the following labels for each respective doc:

[REDACTED]
FBAR

No rush on this, if I could please get the binder by the end of the day Tuesday that's totally fine—and feel free to farm out, too, if you're swamped. Thank you!
