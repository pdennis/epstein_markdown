Good morning all—

asked me to pass along two quick updates. First, Judge Moses signed the search warrant this morning. Second, our case agent told us that FBI received a flight manifest from CBP last night. The passengers listed are Epstein and two pilots. Of course, that is subject to change, and I'm told that FBI will try to get confirmation of the passengers after the flight takes off.
