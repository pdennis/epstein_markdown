Counsel,

Attached please find a supplemental discovery production in the above-referenced case, as well as a corresponding cover letter.

Our paralegals have included a copy of this production on the replacement drive you provided last week to be loaded for your client. The drive was sent to the MDC by FedEx today.

Best,
