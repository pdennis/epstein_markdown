I will be picking up the drives today. Are you available to run out to me around 11:30?

☐ or ☐ ideally I’d be bringing the drives directly to you after pick up. Are you available around 12-1230?

Feel free to call me at ___________________________

&gt; Would you please let us know what time the FBI should plan to make the
&gt; delivery and who will be available to receive the drives on Monday?
