Marc,

Apologies for the delay on this, and thanks for following up. The best way to coordinate this is to contact the case agent directly – I just spoke to her so she’ll be expecting your call. They’re running around, so if you reach out and aren’t able to connect today please let me know, but hopefully we can get it coordinated. The contact is Special Agent [redacted], and she can be reached at [redacted].

thanks,

One of your agents told Marty the case agent would return Epstein’s phone, the cash and other items taken from his person upon arrest. Marty’s returning to Boston shortly. Can you arrange for me to take possession of those items?

Thanks,

Marc

Marc,

Wanted to send this to you as well in case your co-counsel can’t receive it in the Court. Please let me know if it would be helpful to get a hard copy – I’m copying two of our paralegals who can bring you (or co-counsel) a copy; I’ll be unreachable for the next hour or so.

thank you,
