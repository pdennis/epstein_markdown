Hi

We officially received the green light from the powers that be to add you as the "law guy" to the Maxwell team. We're thrilled to have you and are very excited to work with you!

To start getting you up to speed, we'd like to schedule a call for this Thursday. I'm generally available from 12pm to 2pm and after 3:30pm on Thursday. Are there times in there that would work for you?

In the meantime, I'll get you added to the share, and I've attached some of the key memos that you should read when you have time as an introduction to the case.

Thanks very much for jumping on board!
