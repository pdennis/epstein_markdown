Wanted to quickly check the status of the below – it’s only been a couple weeks, so totally understand it may not be complete, but hopefully we’re getting close? If you could please check with the vendor and let us know, we’d be grateful – and we’ll plan to get it to [Redacted] asap once we have access.

thanks,

[Redacted]

[Redacted],

We’ve received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they’ve processed from devices seized and searched in connection with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by [Redacted] (copied here)? I’ve left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming shortly.)

And then [Redacted], these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein search warrant returns.

Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

[Redacted]
