I hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone (see screenshot from Cellebrite, attached). I discussed with Sunny and we wanted to flag this for you, in case it was of any importance to you, since you are on both cases.

Please let me know if you'd like anything further done with this. Thanks so much!
