Subject: FW: Voicemails from Civilian _________________________________________________________________________ in Australia, possibly about Epstein

FYI, these voicemails came into _________________________________________________________________________ direct line. They are from someone named _________________________________________________________________________ in Australia. She knows to call _________________________________________________________________________ by name. She is talking about crimes committed against her. She claims to be a prisoner. She references Lisa Marie Presley, the British Royal Family, President Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein. We are passing these along to you for review and follow up if appropriate or nothing if not. We will be blocking the number from calling again and otherwise doing nothing further on our end because the caller is from a foreign country and because of international comity, we can't respond. Let me know if you have any questions. _________________________________________________________________________
