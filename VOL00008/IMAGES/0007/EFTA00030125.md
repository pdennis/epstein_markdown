As discussed, attached are the title transfer documents we have for Epstein’s New York, Palm Beach, and Virgin Islands residences. I’ve also included the articles of incorporation for four of the relevant entities referenced in the transfer documents. It appears that we obtained at least some of these documents pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Let me know if you need us to distinguish between the documents that we found through without a subpoena and those we obtained via subpoena.

We do not have documents for the New Mexico property, as far as I can tell, but I’ll chat with the team about tracking those down. Please let us know if there are any other materials you need us to find as well.

Thanks,
