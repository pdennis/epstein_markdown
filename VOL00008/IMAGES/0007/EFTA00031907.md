They didn't. Sarah Koch called to ask if we could meet at some point this month and didn't ask about anything specific. That was about it from CBS.

FWIW – we’ve heard that 60 Minutes might run a feature on Epstein this Sunday night. The info came from a different outlet, so no details as of yet, but will let you know if we get anything further.
