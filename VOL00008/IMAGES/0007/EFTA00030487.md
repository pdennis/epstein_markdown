Subject: Questions re Maxwell

Hi

I just got a call from , and we discussed a number of issues regarding Maxwell. The two issues I wanted to follow up with you about are below:

- Maxwell is reporting that a staff member named or was part of the group that included a COVID positive individual but is still working at the MDC. Would you please check on that for me?
- Maxwell reported that a staff member entered her cell while she was inside it and took photographs of her cell today. Anything you can share with me about the purpose of that?

More generally indicated that she believes Maxwell's mental health is deteriorating significantly because of the constant surveillance she is experiencing. She reports being awoken in the night by a light shining into her eyes multiple times a night, being searched more frequently than other inmates, and having a camera constantly pointed at her in a way that other inmates do not experience. Our office of course defers to BOP on decisions regarding what is necessary for safety and security, but I wanted to pass along the concern.

Thanks,
