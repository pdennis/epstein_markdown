Hey man I'm really sorry to ask this, but it turns out I have to fly to California for the Epstein case from Sept. 17-19, which also happens to be when we have three (!) check-ins with Berman:

- 18th, 11:00,
- 19th, 10:00,
- 19th, 11:30,

Could I ask you to please cover those? Or if any issues I can also try to move one or more of them, too. And I should be able to do in October, if that's any consolation. Either way I'll owe you one (or three). Let me know?

thanks.
