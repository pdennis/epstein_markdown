Hi Joe,

Hope the storm missed you this week, and that you and your client are doing okay.

Our team is working out some scheduling issues today, and we should know more by this afternoon. I'll plan to reach out then to discuss scheduling, if that's okay.

Thanks,

Good morning,

Just wanted to check in to see if you still planned to travel south given the storm. Current estimates show a landing (somewhere) Tuesday with very bad weather on Wednesday. Airports might close (which will answer my question), but that's a guess.

Hi [Blacked out],

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will work around it.

Thanks,
