Hey [redacted],

Fedex only retains records for 1 to 5 years depending on which method they use (ground...freight etc.).

We are still waiting on an answer from Victoria Secret. Will let you know as soon as I know.

Hi [redacted], [redacted].

I hope you both are well. We wanted to follow up on a few additional items:

- Contact Victoria Secret and FedEx regarding retention of documents/how far back they keep materials
- Review of images for photos of [redacted]
- Follow up with ALAT regarding UK travel records for Maxwell and Epstein

Happy to discuss if you have any questions.

Thanks very much,
