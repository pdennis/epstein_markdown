Hi ,

Hope you're doing well. Could you please help us create some review batches for this database? In particular, if you could please create batches of all materials designated responsive in the search warrant database that hit on the following terms, that would be very helpful:

-gmax

-gmax1

If the batches could be approximately 500 documents each, that would be great. Thanks!
