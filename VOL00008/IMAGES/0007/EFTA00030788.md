Thanks. I did do a quick scan for the obvious ones but I guess I missed this one. 😊

It's that time again...

If you are in the "to" line of this email, you have a Project Safe Childhood case for which we need an update. Because of the sensitive nature of these cases, it's critical that we don't let cases linger, and, in consultation with your supervisors, we close cases when necessary.

Please review the attached list, noting the most recent entry for any case under your name. Then...

- If the case is uncharged, please advise me of the status of any expected charges and/or come by to discuss next steps.
- If the case has been charged, please send me a quick email with any updates to the case status (e.g., pled, sentenced, on appeal) or, if the status is up to date, please confirm that no changes need to be made.

Thanks in advance for your prompt reply to this email. (Read: Please don't make me hunt you down for updates – this will take approximately 5 minutes.)

Thanks,
