Thank you for reaching out to contact us. [REDACTED] is OPR’s lead attorney assigned to this matter: [REDACTED] is also working on the investigation. [REDACTED] is out of the country for the remainder of the week, but when she returns next week, she can set up a convenient time for the three of you (and anyone else on your end, if needed) to discuss things.

We look forward to speaking with you.

I am one of the AUSAs working on the current investigation of Jeffrey Epstein in the Southern District of New York, and I was given your contact information by [REDACTED] and so wanted to be in touch for any deconfliction or discussion that might be useful with respect to our respective matters. Is there a good time to be in touch sometime this week? I should

generally be able to make myself available at your convenience, and please let me know if any information would be helpful in advance.

thank you,
