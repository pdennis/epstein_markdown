None of the 911 calls were relevant. But here are some additional reports I pulled from that DAS search.

One contains information for an employee of [REDACTED] and the second is the property manager of the location.

1) I am working through these 911 calls but all of them so far come from his alarm company.
2) DAS search from that 212 number was negative results other than is SOMU report popped up.

Thanks, [REDACTED]. Much appreciated. Two quick questions:

1) Are you able to pull the supporting sprint reports for the 911 calls reported in the DAS report, or do we need to subpoena NYPD communications?
2) Are you able to run a DAS search with Epstein's phone number ([REDACTED]) as well? Thanks.

Thanks!

Any chance you're free for a brief call this afternoon? We wanted to touch base about a few items. I'm sure you're both very busy in preparation for Wednesday, so we promise to keep it short.

Thanks,
