First, I wanted to send along the defense’s expert disclosure for your review. We can discuss tomorrow.

On travel arrangements, I have consulted with others internally and can approve the purchase of a business class ticket if nothing else is available. You should attach this email to your Amtrak tickets when you submit for reimbursement.

Thanks,

Hello ________________________________________________________________

Thank you - these rates are fine for the hotel, but in order to stay within the rate limit, I need to book a non-refundable rate. Please confirm the dates you would like me to be in NY next week as well as what dates you anticipate working together for trial prep after the hearing (Thurs/Fri vs Fri/Sat). I need to move patients and would like to know when to schedule them (either Thursday or Saturday). Finally, I will book myself on Amtrak, but for many of the times, the only available options are business class seats - the coach seats are already sold out.

I was informed of the following: You can schedule your own travel but only at the coach/economy rate. For Lodging and M&amp;IE:

Hello ☐,

I have reviewed the materials you sent - I could speak with you tomorrow evening after 7:30 - would that work for you?

Hi ☐

Thanks for your time earlier today. I'm attaching Daubert-related briefing in the case. After you have had a chance to review, let's find a time to speak on the phone. Please let us know some times that work for you. We will let you know about scheduling as soon as we know more.

Also, as I mentioned, you should book your own travel and then send the invoice for travel expenses to

Thank you for getting back to me.

That plan sounds good. Are you anticipating meetings on both the 12th and the 13th? When would you like to start on the 12th and how long do you think we will go on the 13th? I am happy to be flexible, but would like a sense of time so that I can plan for other commitments. In addition, I would still like to speak briefly before this Sunday so that I can adequately prepare for our meeting. My information for traveling is as follows:

Hi

Thanks so much for the quick reply. How about this Sunday, October 31, by Webex? I was thinking we could start in the morning, like 10 am, but please let me know what works for you. As for meeting in-person, let's plan on November 12 and 13. For travel logistics, I need the following information, please:

- Your full name as it appears on your government-issued ID
- Your date of birth
- Your home address, cellphone number, and email address

Once I have that information, I will have [redacted] from our office reach out to you to coordinate travel.

Thanks!

Hello [redacted].

I am leaving for NY on Wednesday 11/17, and returning to NYC on Saturday 11/27. I am totally booked for all of next week, but I could arrange a 3-4 hour conference call for this Friday after 1:30pm or during this coming weekend. With regard to an in-person meeting, I could arrange

to be in New York by early evening on Thursday November 11, and we could plan to meet that night and/or on Friday the 12th. Please let me know if that works for you - Alternatively, I could also be in NY on the Friday/Saturday the 12th and 13th. How much time in-person are you anticipating?

Prior to our video conference, I would like to chat briefly ahead of time so that I can adequately prepare for our meeting.

Thank you,

Hi

I wanted to reach out to set up a time to meet by Webex. I expect the meeting will take 3 hours. Can you please let me know some days and times that work for you? If a weekend is better, we can do that as well. I also want to find a time for us to meet in person in New York before your trip to Italy. Please let me know some dates that work for you for an in-person meeting in New York.
