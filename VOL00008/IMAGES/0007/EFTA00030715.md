MCC's position below is exactly what we told him. He doesn't just get social visits for the sake of it but only for mitigation preparation. He's making it difficult for us to do anything by phone anymore because he "misunderstands" too often.

This is not the position I expected from my first request for Nick to see his parents. Apparently, I misunderstood our conversation from a few weeks ago.

We did not ask the court to intervene because of my understanding. We will be filing a request for intervention ahead of our next appearance.

Hi Bruce,

MCC New York has permitted social visits despite disciplinary sanctions when the visit is specifically for mitigation purposes. Disciplinary sanctions notwithstanding, all pretrial inmates have the same access to family communications: monitored social visiting, monitored social phone calls, and monitored social mail. While I understand your client is a death penalty case, there are many inmates at MCC with very complex cases who have legal decisions they need to discuss with their families, and the methods available to them are the three methods I just mentioned. If a social phone call is insufficient, then we will raise the issue again with administrators to see if they will allow a social visit during your client's regular social visiting hours. However, please be advised that once your client returns to general population with regular phone access, I do not anticipate administrators will be amenable to social visit requests unless they are being used as mitigation evidence.

I am out of the office starting tomorrow, but Adam will let you know once he discusses it with Exec staff.

Thanks,

Staff Attorney

I am sorry, but that won't be sufficient. We had a conversation with [redacted] and [redacted] a few weeks back and they told us that, in light of the particular needs for preparation for a capital case, MCC would permit periodic social visits as needed. I did not raise this issue with the court because of what we were told. Perhaps I misunderstood.

Hi Bruce,

After some discussion, MCC's administrators are prepared to offer your client a social phone call with his parents, which would be outside the normal phone schedule provided to inmates in Special Housing. If you fell that would be inadequate, please advise and Adam and I will take the issue back to our administrators.

Thank you,

Hi Bruce,

Our Exec staff are still discussing it. I should hopefully have an answer for you by tomorrow. In the meantime, can you give me any information about the "critical stage" in the case? I don't want to know anything that would violate privilege, but something very general (e.g. a plea is on the table, a cooperation agreement is on the table, etc.) might help our Exec staff evaluate the request.

Thanks,
