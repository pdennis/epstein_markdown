Hi _______________________________

Here's the final version we plan to file in the morning. It's in brief format, at the District of New Hampshire's request. The plan is to file it in SDNY and email a copy to the DNH magistrate judge, but let us know if you think we should proceed otherwise (the AUSA in DNH didn't seem to have a view on how we should file). We didn't want to file it with New Hampshire captions and signature blocks, as much as I would have gotten a kick out of signing as a SAUSA. But let us know if you think we should be going about this a different way.

Thanks!
