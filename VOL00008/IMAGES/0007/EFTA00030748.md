Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview in Los Angeles on November 14. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 13th to the 15th (and no conference room necessary for this trip).

thanks,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and , and we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on that Monday for the interview, please.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, , and/or , as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and or and , but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
