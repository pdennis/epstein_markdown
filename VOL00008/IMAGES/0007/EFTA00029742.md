I just realized that I may have pick-up responsibilities tonight. Could we do 2:30 instead?

Thanks. Rough 24 hours, but good to be back. What works for you guys today? Aside from something at 2, I think [REDACTED] and I are pretty flexible.

Yes, just start drafting. I think the lawyer will then review what they have. If any holes are identified that require further interviews or other fact-finding, they will be in touch with us before doing so. But it may make sense to have a conversation with [REDACTED] to get his understanding as well.

On the report, we can chat when [REDACTED] is back tomorrow – but when you say start the report, do you just mean start drafting? Is it contemplated that they will do further interviews beyond what have been done for the criminal case? Any sense of timing?

[REDACTED] and I discussed the BOP Board of Inquiry with [REDACTED] and are going to follow up with [REDACTED] – happy to discuss.

By way of further update, I spoke with [redacted] from OIG today. They had a conference call with Inspector General [redacted] this morning, who dictated that they start the report on the case. The report will include everything from the time of Epstein’s admission to the MCC up to the time of his death. [redacted] in DC is the attorney assigned to the report. The first issue under examination is why Epstein was not given a new cellmate following Reyes’s departure—a draft of this section of the report is expected to be completed by the end of this week. They will be starting with the materials from the criminal investigation. If they need to do additional fact finding, they will be in touch with us before doing so. There is no deadline yet for the completion of the report, which will likely become public.

It likely makes sense to have a brief discussion. In the email below, OIG requested our position on the investigation, but I [redacted] know if we have provided one yet. We may also want to have a call with [redacted].

Hello Everyone,

Our HQ staff was contacted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in association with the matters concerning the Epstein/MCC case, and informed that they would like to convene a Board of Inquiry that would review the operations at the MCC NY. I have been asked to share this with the investigative and prosecution team for opinion and consideration. I requested that the BOP provide us with some specific information and details about what this would include and we were provided with the below information and attached Program Statement. Can you all please review

EFTA00029744

this information and then can one representative from the FBI and one representative from the U.S. Attorney's Office, SDNY, let us know your office's position regarding this matter? I have included SA [redacted] and ASAC [redacted] of our Operations Branch I (OPS I) in this email as they deal directly with the BOP HQ. Thank you all.

Hi [redacted].

The BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations generally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, review camera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a misconduct investigation. Should the Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent with normal misconduct reporting requirements.

We are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise connected to the criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if you have additional questions or would like to discuss. Thanks in advance.
