Attached is a draft response due today at 5 pm. We still need to send this letter to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] at the MDC to review for accuracy. Do you think you will be able to review shortly or should I send them this draft simultaneously? We highlighted some language for your consideration about Judge Nathan's deadlines, happy to discuss. We haven't engaged with the defense's footnote 1 about the volume of the materials delivered because that is a little more complicated and we want to make sure any representations are fully accurate, but happy to discuss.

Thanks,

From: [REDACTED] (USANYS) &lt;;&gt;

Hi [REDACTED].

Judge Nathan just ordered us to respond to this letter as soon as possible but no later than 5 pm today. We've reached out to BOP to set up a call.

Thanks,
