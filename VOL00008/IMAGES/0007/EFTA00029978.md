Hi

This morning, I dropped off the laptop with a power cord and cover memo for Maxwell to use when reviewing her discovery. Attached please find a copy of the cover memo.

I also dropped off a hard drive and CD containing a new discovery production for Maxwell. Attached please find the two cover letters.

Last week, we sent out via FedEx a hard drive containing a separate production, which included replacements of numerous files that Maxwell has been unable to review from prior productions. The accompanying cover letters are attached. Would you please confirm that the drive has been provided to Maxwell?

Thanks very much, as always, for your help.
