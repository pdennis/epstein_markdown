Okay ☐. I know the issue. The TDY needs to be changed to Santa Monica, CA instead of Los Angeles, CA since you're actually staying in a hotel that's in Santa Monica, CA, which has a per diem of $248. Los Angeles, CA has a per diem of $181 only. I'll make the amendments and resend your Travel Authorization to Budget ASAP.

I've booked my travel in E2 – once again it's saying the hotel is over the per diem, but that's not correct (it's a dollar under) but let me know if you need any more info. Otherwise should be good to go, thanks!

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview (or possibly interviews) in Los Angeles on December 16

and/or 17. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 15th to the 18th. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days.

thank you,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and , and we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me,

EFTA00030449

and/or [redacted], as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
