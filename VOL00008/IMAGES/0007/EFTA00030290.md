With apologies for the belated response, that works for me if it’s still okay for you – I’ll try you in a couple minutes

[REDACTED],

Been a little while since we’ve been in touch—I hope you’re well. I was wondering if it would be possible to speak briefly tomorrow? I’m available anytime until 4:00 p.m., and would be happy to chat in the morning if that’s convenient, though I understand it’s short notice. Please let me know what might work? And thank you very much as always.

Many thanks

Unfortunately I’m in the grand jury and meetings most of the afternoon, but I’ll be free (and in the office) anytime this evening starting at 5:00, or could talk anytime tomorrow before 2:00. What works best for you?

thanks,

I am one of the AUSAs working on the current investigation of Jeffrey Epstein in the Southern District of New York, and I was given your contact information by [redacted] and so wanted to be in touch for any deconfliction or discussion that might be useful with respect to our respective matters. Is there a good time to be in touch sometime this week? I should generally be able to make myself available at your convenience, and please let me know if any information would be helpful in advance.

thank you,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
