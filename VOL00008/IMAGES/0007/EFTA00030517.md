Attachments: 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, docx; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, docx; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, Ghislane Maxwell.docx; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, docx; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, docx; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, x; 2019-08-02, JE, individual_subpoena, docx

I threw together the attached as a first attempt to put together some document subpoenas. Please let me know if there's anything you think I should add/remove/rephrase. Also not sure whether we actually want to serve all of these people, or if there are others that we will also want to subpoena, but let me know.
