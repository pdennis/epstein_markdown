[redacted] thanks very much for these. To confirm, we've received three emails, with nine photos total -- let us know if that's everything or if we should have received (or should be expecting) more? And thanks again.

Please let me know if there are issues opening and I can resend. Due to size, had to send multiple emails.

Thanks,
