Thanks, [redacted]. What day did the facilities manager talk to him / test run the shower?

Hi [redacted].

Just a couple updates:

I caught one of the officers who normally does SHU rec. He confirmed that [redacted] can go to the roof for recreation. SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said [redacted] is usually sleeping, and once he eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when [redacted] and Epstein were housed together, Epstein asked about rec. The officer told Epstein he would take him at 6:00 AM before his attorneys showed up. [redacted] was in the cell during this conversation, and the officer told me made a comment like "I can take you up together" to both of them.

The Facilities Manager told me they talked to [redacted]. He had no complaints about his cell. He only complained that water leaked in his cell when people "took long showers." Facilities ran the shower for awhile and didn't see the water leaking down to [redacted] cell, but if I give [redacted] the benefit of the doubt, he may be correct that the water makes its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time.

Evening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave [redacted] the three newspapers that arrived in the mail yesterday morning.

I think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks!
