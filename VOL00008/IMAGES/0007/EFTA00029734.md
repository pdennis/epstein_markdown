Marty,

Our expected timeline was extended slightly by the follow-up letter received on August 1, but my hope is that we will be sending a comprehensive response tomorrow, or if not, no later than Monday. We will let you know Monday if for some reason that estimate has changed.

thank you,

From: Martin G. Weinberg &lt;_________________________&gt;
