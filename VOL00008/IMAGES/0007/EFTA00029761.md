On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53.

Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the suspect.

Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt, and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's information which was

I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. Epstein told me he would call when he had more information.

Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side of the house but not the west side of house because he had personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee Blvd. to obtain the information.

Crime Scene Manager processed the crime scene and collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.

At 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, I was notified at home by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a burglary had been reported at 358 El Brillo. I responded to the scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process the crime scene.

I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way leading to a three car garage.

The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The western most gate was in the closed position. The front was locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been touched or tampered with.

On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass windows present. The eastern most and western most are identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of 14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central window.

Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det. Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a supplement to that effect that will follow.

On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. [REDACTED] and I went to 358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal assistant [REDACTED] in regards to obtaining the video footage of the suspect burglar.

Det. [REDACTED] obtained a video of the footage starting at 0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a property receipt.

At 1400 hours, Det. [REDACTED] and I went to the [REDACTED] in West Palm Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed several video cameras on the outside of the building and a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the building.

At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager [REDACTED] that he had located fingerprints for the suspect [REDACTED] from a Town of Palm Beach identification card application.

Epstein stated that he presented [redacted] with a photograph obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby [redacted] admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. [redacted] told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the gun so he took the money. [redacted] are having problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun because he was contemplating suicide.

Epstein stated that [redacted] has already returned $2,000. of the stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with [redacted] to pay off the remaining funds.

I placed the Miranda Rights card along with the VCR tape of [redacted] admission, into evidence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please add the following names and their information into the system.

Reported By: 11/12/03
Entered By: 11/12/03

On 10/08/03, Officer [redacted] advised me that he had located [redacted] the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the [redacted] Condominium. Officer [redacted] further advised that [redacted] vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag [redacted].

On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. [redacted] that Epstein had met with [redacted] and had reached an agreement to pay back the money taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time. I was also advised that Det. [redacted] had interviewed [redacted] and had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had denied taking the Glock hand gun.

In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show [redacted] taking the hand gun and [redacted] denies taking the gun.

On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with mailing the original back to me for my case file.

At 1500 hours, Det. [redacted] removed the video surveillance equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.

Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met with no response from his staff. It should be noted that Epstein had personally met with Capt. [redacted] and at that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute [redacted] for the burglary and theft from his residence.

ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S. Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.
