&gt; Sorry I missed this. I am super annoyed. Just got out of mag court. Running home to feed the baby. But I am around later tonight or tomorrow afternoon when I come back from white plains.

&gt; I am still in NJ. I have everything we have downloaded to CD. It's at the office. I can bring it when we meet.

&gt;&gt; Hi all—looking forward to meeting this afternoon. If you’re able to bring over a copy of the files on this case (we’ll take as much stuff as possible!), we’d really appreciate it. CD or drive are both fine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks!

I have child care issues in the mornings typically, and getting in by 11:00 is often difficult as I live in Suffolk County. 4:30 works better for me. Sorry about that!

&gt;&gt; I unfortunately have calls at 4:00 and 4:30. Could we do earlier before 11:00? I'm also concerned that if the proffer ends up going late we'll be out of luck. Or I can move the 4:30 if that's preferable for everybody. Sorry about that.

&gt;&gt; 11:00 will not work for me. Me and  are good for 4:00 on Thursday though. The proffer should be done by then.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let's do Thursday, particularly since schedules seem to be tough next week. , would it make sense to meet before your proffer, so we can have a specified time? We could meet at 11:00.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks,

&gt;&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thursday I have a proffer at SNDY with SA &lt; at 12:00. I can meet after that if you guys want depending on how long this proffer goes. That may be the best option for us because Monday-Wednesday of next week we may be tied up with a take down in the office.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The only day I'd be free this week would be Thursday. Next Wednesday is not good, but any other day next week I should be ok right now.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm also working on putting everything we currently have onto a disk for you, so I should have that for you when we meet.
