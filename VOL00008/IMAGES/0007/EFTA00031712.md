He " " - yeah, I was in Florida on Wednesday and Thursday, thanks for checking in on this. It hasn't been resolved (and I didn't hear back from all week), so I'm going to send an email suggesting we all get together to talk it through. Just yesterday we got access to the latest document dump, and it's over a million files, and we have no idea where they came from, so we definitely want to nail it down. We're all in L.A. most of this week, but the week after should be around (which will also provide time for people to figure out schedules).

thanks as always,

I reached out to your office line, let me know if we need to discuss. Has this issue been resolved?

" " see below – just wanted to loop you into this too, since we've previously talked about the search warrant returns. We are now finally starting to get a significant amount into the system, but the problem is we have no idea what it is, where it's from, etc. We're just getting huge amounts of documents, but don't know what device they came from, room, any identifying info, etc etc. So working on getting that.

Currently, both " " have access on Relativity to a little over 20,000 documents from the Manhattan residence, and I expect that will go up substantially in the next week or so once we get this next set of materials reviewed for privilege.

Happy to chat if that'd be useful, and thanks as always.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it – I have the hard drive that dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old

materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new.

Just generally, and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded.

So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received – but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items.

I don't want to give anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to what we already have. are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info – which device, and what materials from it – are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us.

We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful – and thanks everybody for the assistance.
