Subject: Call re Epstein responsiveness review

Hi

Hope you're having a nice weekend. Is there a time on Tuesday when you would be available for a call to discuss the responsiveness review of the Epstein SW returns on Relativity, please?

I'm available the entire morning if there's a time that would work for you.

Thanks,
