Hey, I can't tell from the email threads whether this UBS subpoena covers the Angara trust. Do you know? It isn't listed by name but I don't know what the account numbers are. Thanks!

Mr. Wills,

I'm reaching out in connection with the attached subpoena, which was served on UBS last week. If possible, we would like to speak with someone in your compliance department to discuss expediting these materials. This matter is time sensitive, and if possible, we would very much appreciate being able to speak with someone this afternoon. I'm also copying Mr. Ryan, who I understand has assisted with prior productions to our office in connection with this same investigation.

I can be reached at [redacted] at any time, and I'm copying my colleagues, [redacted] and [redacted], who can be reached at [redacted] and [redacted], respectively.

Thank you,

Assistant United States Attorney
