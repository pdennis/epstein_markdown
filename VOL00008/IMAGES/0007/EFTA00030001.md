Dear Mr. Berman

Further to my email of yesterday, I have come across some notes that someone sent me in February regarding North Yorkshire Police and child procurer for the elite, Jimmy Savile. The informant mentions ex Surrey Police officer, Mark Williams-Thomas, who is now a well-respected and reputable investigative journalist who has written several books.

As a police officer, he specialized in major crime and child abuse. I am told that Surrey police DID investigate allegations against Jimmy Savile but they could not pin anything on him, partly due to North Yorkshire Police not disclosing the information that they had on him. Mr. Williams-Thomas might be a helpful contact, particularly with regard to North Yorkshire Police obstruction in child abuse investigations.

Also, if you managed to listen to the YOUTUBE interview with ex MI5 operative and now barrister, Michael Shrimpton, he alleges that Thames Valley Police, whom I believe also obstructed the international Project Spade, Toronto-led investigation, has (or had), German operatives (or spies) embedded in Thames Valley Police. Peter and Barbara Hofschroer, were seriously abused by the criminal activities of North Yorkshire Police. There are strong indications that North Yorkshire Police have close allies at extremely senior levels, in both the Austrian and German police, and the Austrian judiciary. I cannot say what, exactly, but have seen the results of obvious transnational criminal collusion.

Regards,

Yours sincerely,

Jean James
