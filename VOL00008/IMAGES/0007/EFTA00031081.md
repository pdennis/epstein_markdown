# Sasse Statement on Arrests of Epstein's Guards

"These arrests are important, but they're not the end of this: These guards aren't the only ones who should stand trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars."

Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who warned the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to come to today's oversight hearing prepared to give answers, issued the following statement regarding the arrests of two of Jeffrey Epstein's

prison guards.

"Good. Heads needed to roll the day Jeffrey Epstein died. The Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice need to start giving the public some answers. These arrests are important, but they're not the end of this: These guards aren't the only ones who should stand trial - every one of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators should be spending the rest of their lives behind bars."

Background:

On November 13, Sasse told the Director of Bureau of Prisons to show up to today's hearing prepared to answer questions.

On August 19, when Attorney General Barr removed the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, Sasse praised the move and called for more answers.

On August 13, Sasse urged Attorney General Barr to rip up the plea deal with Epstein that still shields his co-conspirators. That letter is available here.

On August 10, the day of Epstein's death, Sasse wrote to Attorney General Barr demanding that "heads must roll" and asking transparency questions to make sure the DOJ answers for the miscarriage of justice.

In February 2019, at Sasse's insistence, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into its handling of Epstein, who was charged with running a child sex trafficking ring in New York and Florida, among other locations.

On January 15, 2019, during his confirmation hearing, William Barr, the President's nominee for Attorney General, publicly committed to making sure that the DOJ responded to Senator Sasse's questions into the Epstein case and that they would prioritize the prosecution of sex-trafficking.

In late 2018, Sasse repeatedly pushed the DOJ to investigate the sweetheart deal that Epstein received.
