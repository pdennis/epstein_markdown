Hi

Thank you for getting back to me on your day off!

I just remember when the tabloids sent their photographer out, they took note of the date on the back which was in 1997 and possibly took a picture of it but as I do not want to contact the tabloids right now, I just need the evidence to ensure that is correct. If you can, when you get back to the office, is there any chance you could have a look to see if there is in fact a date mentioned or photographed, it would be very helpful and I would be more than appreciative.

Have a nice day!!

Hi

I'm away from the office today. I don't recall the photo having a date on it but I will review the file when I get a chance.

G'day

I was just wondering if by chance you might have the original dates of the photos you copied from our original meetings, oddly enough I have every other original photo but the one with Prince Andrew and that's no good as I am in need of just the date on the picture. You're my last chance on these dates unless by good fortune this picture shows up. Sorry to be a pain, I hope I'm not to much a bother. Just trying to do get something accomplished!

Hope all is well!!

All the best,
