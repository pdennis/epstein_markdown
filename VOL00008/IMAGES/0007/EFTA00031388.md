Will take a look. In the interim, have something else you may be interested in if you have a moment.

I just read the attached opinion in a civil case (it came on my radar because Judge Pauley made a comment about Epstein's death at MCC) – I was wondering if you knew whether our office ever investigated the guards involved in this. This was a 2015 incident, but it's still within the statute of limitations, and seems quite serious.
