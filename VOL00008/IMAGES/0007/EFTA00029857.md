Just FYI, got another call from Ms. ______________________ this afternoon, looking for a follow-up. We did not discuss anything substantive, and I said I would pass along that she had called.

Subject: Epstein victim call

Team, I just received a call on my desk line from a woman named ______________________ who identified herself as a former client of ______________________ and said she was a former victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I asked if her attorney had been in touch with either the prosecutors or the case agents, since we had previously contacted him, and she said she believed he had not been. She said she had been in touch with an NYPD detective but had not heard back in some time. She said ______________________ represented her for purposes of the Victim Fund, but was not currently representing her. She provided her cell phone as ______________________. She did not provide any substantive information on the call, and I did not ask for any. I advised that someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so. The call lasted less than three minutes.

For context, we were in touch with Mr. ______________________ several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine Epstein victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which we couldn’t find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached.

thanks,
