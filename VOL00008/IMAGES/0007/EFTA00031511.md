Subject: Cheat Sheet

Here's a first attempt at a cheat sheet for Wednesday. It currently includes the statute and time period charged in each Count; the particular lies underlying each perjury spec; a note on the applicable statute of limitations; and a similar note on the sex trafficking statute with which Epstein was charged (and Maxwell is not).

I can of course reformat, revise, or add anything else that might be helpful.
