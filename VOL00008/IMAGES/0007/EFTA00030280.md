Aimee – great to hear from you, and I didn't know about that case so I appreciate the heads up. It's an avalanche of info these days so we're just triaging at all times. Will add this to our list for Monday – thanks again. And yes, would be great to catch up sometime soon!

Hope all is well at the Office. Would love to get together for lunch or something sometime soon. Just reaching out because I believe you are handling the Epstein case and that Berman is assigned. I assume you all know this, but Judge Berman had the Cameron Douglas case, which I handed with Jeff Brown at the time, and Cameron Douglas was granted bail with various requirements that he reside in his NY apartment with 24 hr surveillance paid for by him etc. He ultimately violated those conditions by smuggling drugs via an electric toothbrush. Berman is obviously well aware of the situation and it could be a helpful data point for you all if you don't already know about it (not sure anyone is left with the institutional knowledge of that case).

Best,

Aimee
