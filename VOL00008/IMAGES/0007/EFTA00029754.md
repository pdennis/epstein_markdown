Circling back on this, both in terms of moving the documents and de-duping – there are an absolutely insane amount of repeat docs. Please let us know the status? Thanks.

Also we really need to get these results de-duped – there are *tons* of repeat documents.

Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all messed up – we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because the FBI case file is also huge.

If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to provide guidance on that.

Moving may be an issue, PAE had trouble releasing the data because they were so voluminous.

Ah, possibly it's the "2020-01-23" folder under Subpoena Returns? If so, ☐ can we please (1) move that to under the Search Warrant Returns folder, and (2) if at all possible, combine the 37 different subfolders into one? There doesn't appear to be any distinction between all of those folders so I don't think there's any utility in having so many subgroups. But let us know if (2) is a problem and happy to discuss.

I think they are in the Subpoena Returns folder, which I thought was strange. I'm heading to ☐ now but will log in after that to find them.

, just tried calling but didn't catch you - I don't see where these are located in Relativity? I think they should be under "Search Warrant Returns" but I don't see them there (or anywhere else under the Epstein overall folder). Let me know if I've just missed them, which is entirely possible, or if they're not accessible to us yet? Thank you!

[redacted], wanted to follow up on this – is the data fully uploaded, or did it get delayed? Thanks.

Wanted to quickly check the status of the below – it's only been a couple weeks, so totally understand it may not be complete, but hopefully we're getting close? If you could please check with the vendor and let us know, we'd be grateful – and we'll plan to get it to asap once we have access.

thanks,

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by (copied here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming shortly.)

And then , these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein search warrant returns.

Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And very much as always.
