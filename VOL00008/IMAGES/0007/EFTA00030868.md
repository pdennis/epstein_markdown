Absolutely! I plan to be in the Office all day on Monday, and am happy to meet you or whomever at any time that is convenient. I can be reached via mobile ( or email. Once you, or whoever is delivering the items, lets me know when would work to hand off the materials, I'll have all the items ready for you.

Thanks very much, all!

Hey,

Would you please coordinate with to get her (or whoever from the FBI is delivering the drives to the MDC) the two drives for Maxwell, along with the password cover letter on Monday?

This delivery should include both the smaller drive you loaded today, and the bigger drive containing a full copy of all discovery to date. (If the drive without a cord isn't ready by the time the FBI is picking it up, please just give them the one with the cord).

Thanks so much,

Good afternoon,

The FBI has very kindly agreed to deliver two new drives from my office to the MDC for Ghislaine Maxwell on Monday, January 11th. I've cc'd Special Agent , who will be coordinating the delivery. Would you please let us know what time the FBI should plan to make the delivery and who will be available to receive the drives on Monday?

Thank you all very much for your help.

Best,
