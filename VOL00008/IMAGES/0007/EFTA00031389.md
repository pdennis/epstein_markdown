I will work with any date you have the week of 11/4. I truly apologize. After our conversation I called my client for 10/31. He is quite anxious. I did not intend to waste anyone's time or resources.

Per my email, we made ourselves available for today and confirmed 3 p.m. today. I did not confirm 10/31. We're not available this week and I'll have to go back to the case team to see when they're available. You can send us some dates for the weeks of 11/4 and 11/11 that work for you.

What will? My client is flying in from Florida based on our original conversation. From our discussion you said 10/31 and I called him immediately.

I am sorry I would not have confirmed for today. I had a 4 pm doctors appointment scheduled for months. I had told mark 10/31 as well. My apologies. Can we still do 10/31?
