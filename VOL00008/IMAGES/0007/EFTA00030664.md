The British tabloids' willingness to (1) pay sources, (2) ask leading questions about Andrew and Maxwell in particular, and then (3) twist and sensationalize the answers ("He was a nice guy. I never see him with girls. I never see him with . I never saw him naked or actually having the massage" becomes the headline "maybe has something to hide") is really not helpful.
