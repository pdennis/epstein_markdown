I am still in NJ. I have everything we have downloaded to CD. It's at the office. I can bring it when we meet.

I'm in the proffer and do not have the disc with me. If I'm not mistaken  may still be in NJ. If I finish up over here earlier then expected I'll ran back and grab it.

Hi all—looking forward to meeting this afternoon. If you're able to bring over a copy of the files on this case (we'll take as much stuff as possible!), we'd really appreciate it. CD or drive are both fine.

Thanks!

No worries at all, and I'll make 4:30 work.

I have child care issues in the mornings typically, and getting in by 11:00 is often difficult as I live in Suffolk County. 4:30 works better for me. Sorry about that!

I unfortunately have calls at 4:00 and 4:30. Could we do earlier before 11:00? I'm also concerned that if the proffer ends up going late we'll be out of luck. Or I can move the 4:30 if that's preferable for everybody. Sorry about that.

11:00 will not work for me. Me and |  |
| --- | are good for 4:00 on Thursday though. The proffer should be done by then.

Let's do Thursday, particularly since schedules seem to be tough next week. would it make sense to meet before your proffer, so we can have a specified time? We could meet at 11:00.

thanks,

Hey guys,

Thursday I have a proffer at SNDY with [Redacted] at 12:00. I can meet after that if you guys want depending on how long this proffer goes. That may be the best option for us because Monday-Wednesday of next week we may be tied up with a take down in the office.

Hey [Redacted],

The only day I'd be free this week would be Thursday. Next Wednesday is not good, but any other day next week I should be ok right now.

I'm also working on putting everything we currently have onto a disk for you, so I should have that for you when we meet.

☑ good speaking with you. I understand that you and ☑ were just assigned the case yesterday and are just starting to dig in. As we discussed I think it makes sense for us all to get into a room together son and chat.

When works for you guys?
