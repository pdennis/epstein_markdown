Good afternoon,

I am planning to bring a laptop and charger for inmate Ghislaine Maxwell (Reg. No. 02879-509) to use when reviewing discovery produced from my office. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter, which I will hand deliver with the laptop. I am available to make this delivery tomorrow. Would you please let me know what time I should arrive with the laptop?

My understanding from [redacted] is that I should bring the laptop to the East Building, located on 29th Street near 3rd Avenue and that I should go to the front lobby and ask for [redacted], who will then come and retrieve the laptop. Please let me know if that is correct, or if I should take any different steps.

As always, I can be reached on my cellphone at [redacted] with any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Maurene
