Mike,

That's fine, though if you prefer a different time – later this evening, tomorrow early morning, tomorrow late evening, etc – we can accommodate. Let us know if you prefer something like that, or otherwise we'll plan to call you at 2:30.

thanks again,

Mike,

We don't think it makes sense to put this off for an entire week, particularly since it has been three weeks since we met and you were otherwise prepared to speak earlier today. We're also continuing to hold in abeyance a grand jury date that otherwise would have been two weeks ago. We can make ourselves available in an early morning or evening or

night if your schedule is otherwise jammed, if that's helpful? But we would like to get an update sooner rather than later, even if it's a relatively brief conversation at this stage. Please let us know?

thanks.

We wanted to follow up on our previous discussions and our meeting the week before last. Is there a good time for you early next week to discuss status?
