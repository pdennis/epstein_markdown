Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation through his lawyer, Jeff Brown of Dechert LLP, to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. Brown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about which the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time.

“It’s fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the Governor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed,” said Mr. Brown.

Furthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor by any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so that Epstein’s victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice they deserve.
