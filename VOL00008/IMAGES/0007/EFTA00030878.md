Ah, ok. Yeah I think they are the intake squad for MCC matters (I worked with them on the Epstein death investigation) but I'll reach out to [redacted] to confirm.

He was assigned to C-19, and I was assigned to C-30/New York Metro Safe Streets. C-19 is the initial intake squad for Criminal complaints. I am not sure whether they are responsible for assaults within a federal prison.

Thanks [redacted] Which squad was that? And which squad were you on at the time? I'm trying to figure out why MCC would have referred that to [redacted]

Hi [redacted].

I have an answer. SA [redacted] was assigned to the NYO Bank Robbery Task force at the time of the assault. He has since retired from the FBI, and therefore he would not be able to answer my work emails. Respectfully,

Hey [redacted] - hope all is well! We're working on a motion filed by Robert Gist related to the prison assault. Can you tell me what squad [redacted] was on at the time he got this referral and forwarded it to you (Feb 2017)? My memory is that he was on the squad responsible for dealing with MCC stuff – is that right? And is [redacted] still with the FBI?
Thanks!
