|  Subject: [EXTERNAL] FBI Still Needing Tips Regarding Jeffrey Epstein / Ghislaine Maxwell?  | |

Dear Ms.  -

I feel Jeffrey Epstein &amp;/or Ghislaine Maxwell reached out to me, in July 2019, (around the time he was apprehended) via Seeking Arrangements (probably just "Seeking" these days.) It was a brief communication out of Palm Beach, but it was right to the point. The person/people wanted me to be a recruiter and they basically wanted to know if it seemed appealing to go out partying and "bring home girls to Daddy." This notion seemed wholly cringeworthy with ick-factor and I don't think I replied in any fashion.

It may be worth the while for the FBI to subpoena Seeking Arrangements' records out of Palm Beach. I feel extremely confident that Maxwell &amp;/or Epstein were actively using this platform for recruiting. I think they were attracted to me, because my profile pics looked like her...we could pass for family.

From what you know, is this tidbit important? Does the FBI know about the Seeking Arrangement connection? Should I be conveying this information to anyone in particular? I'm sort of afraid to become involved, but I also feel everything should be done so justice can help the young victims.

Thank you,
