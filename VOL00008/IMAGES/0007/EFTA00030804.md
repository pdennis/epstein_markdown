Hi

I am not sure if this would be helpful to you but we just got in a FOIA response request this week and it shows Maxwell on a notarized 1994 documents swearing she is a “disinterested” party and issuing an appraisal for certain of Epstein’s New Mexico land. Just wanted to pass it along because it is the earliest document I believe I have seen her name on.

Best,
