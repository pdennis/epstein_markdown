Re: NY Times, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, et al.
Civil No. 20-cv-833
FOIA Request No. 2019-05665

Dear Ms. Ivory:

Attached, please find the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) release of the first set of records responsive to the above captioned case and corresponding FOIA Request No. 2019-05665. After careful review of the first set of records, we have determined 10 pages are available for release in full; 9 pages are available for release in part; 1 page is duplicative and 434 pages must be withheld in their entirety. Copies of the releasable records are attached hereto.

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, the records are redacted and/or withheld under the following exemptions:

(b)(5) - concerns certain inter- and intra-agency communications protected by the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product privilege, and/or the attorney-client privilege;
(b)(6) - concerns material the release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties;
(b)(7)(A) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;
(b)(7)(B) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication
(b)(7)(C) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties;
(b)(7)(E) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions;
(b)(7)(F) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or personal safety of an individual.
