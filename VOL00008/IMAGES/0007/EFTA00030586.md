Hi

I'm going through discovery on a case and part of that is a picture of me with Prince Andrew, do you recall seeing the date on the back and was it recorded. Did I receive the original back or was it kept as evidence? I know it's been a long time but anything helps.

I hope you've been well!! Still fighting the good fight!!

Kindly.
