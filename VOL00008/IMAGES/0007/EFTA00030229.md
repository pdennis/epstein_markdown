Mr. ________________

Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or concerns in this matter.
