Is there an agenda for this? If so, I have no problem meeting in person, but if we just expect it to be like 10 minutes of introducing ourselves then I'd personally vote phone call.

Same here, thanks. Would you guys prefer in person or by phone? I have no preference.

I’ve CC’d the forensic accountant [redacted] in our squad who will be assisting in this investigation. Let’s try and plan a day next week to meet briefly and discuss a game plan. Are you guys around Tuesday to chat?

Tomorrow morning could you please burn the following folders to a disc:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY

investigation\Subpoena Returns\American Express

and put the disc in an envelope addressed to:

Special Agent
Detective

If it's possible to get the disc by 11:30, we'll give the disc to at the conference, or if not, if you could put the envelope with security and reply all that it's ready, they can pick up when convenient.

thanks,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
