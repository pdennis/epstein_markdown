Hi

The meeting in NYC went great &amp; we're able to make some long strides in the cases. Brad &amp; I have had a lot of good ideas but more than that we have been trying to make way for present day victims. It's astounding how much abuse &amp; trafficking cases there really is going on.

I was hoping that you might have had a chance to look into the Eppinger case or just the dates I was with him as it would help me pinpoint my timeline. I am very grateful for any assistance &amp; wish you all the best!! Thank you!!

Kindest Regards,
