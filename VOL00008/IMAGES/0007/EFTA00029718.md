Our grand jury subpoenas are to obtain evidence that would relate to a crime, and I’m not sure that this would be reasonably related to evidence for the sex trafficking investigation, which is what we are working on. Are you not able to simply request these materials from the relevant offices? If not, and if this is in connection with an investigation into his death, I think you would need to have a subpoena issued in connection with the team that is working on that investigation in our office, which is [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. Their emails are:
