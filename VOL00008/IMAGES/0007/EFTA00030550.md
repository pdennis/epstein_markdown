Hi

Today we are sending a new drive containing additional discovery materials for Ghislaine Maxwell to the MDC via FedEx. Attached please find the accompanying cover letters to the MDC.

Would you please keep an eye out for the drive and let us know when it has been given to Maxwell?

Thanks very much,

Assistant United States Attorney Southern District of New York
