Hope everyone is having a nice weekend. Attached is a draft letter, please feel free to edit freely. I tried to capture defense counsel's position in this letter, but again, please edit if you think I have missed anything. [REDACTED] asked to see this later tonight or tomorrow morning so would appreciate any edits by tonight if possible (I'll be in NJ for Mother's Day so won't be able to turn to it until this evening). Thoughts on responding to [REDACTED] latest email? Should we just say that the November 29 trial start date would permit the entire team to do the trial?
