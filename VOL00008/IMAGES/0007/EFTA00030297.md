Subject: Victims' Concerns re: Epstein's release

- I know you are crazy busy so my apologies for the interruption and I realize that you noted this in your filing – but the victims I represent asked that I communicate to you their significant concern for their own safety if Epstein is released. Thank you for all you are doing.

Best,

Sigrid
