United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): In July 2020, Maxwell was charged in a six-count indictment with facilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The charges resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators, including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s abusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021.
