Counsel,

The Government's first discovery production in this case has been loaded onto the drive you provided this afternoon and is ready for pickup at our office. If you are sending a runner to pick up the production, he or she should just ask for the envelope with Michael Miller's name on it. I've also attached a copy of the accompanying discovery and disclosure letter to this email.

Please let me know if you have any difficulty accessing the discovery on the drive.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
