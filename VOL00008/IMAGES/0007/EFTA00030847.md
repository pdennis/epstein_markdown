Good morning Bobbi:

While I understand the mail you have sent is time sensitive, there are BOP policies that must be complied with. All mail must be processed in a particular manner prior to being provided to an inmate. The legal department is not involved in the processing of mail for any inmates in Institution. The institution is not allowing visitors, therefore the mail may not be hand delivered, but again, the mail must be properly processed before provided to the inmate. Unfortunately, this is not something I can assist with.

Best,

Ms. Maxwell needs to review time-sensitive documents for filing on Monday 1/25.

It appears that overnight express mail is not received next day and delivery to Ms. Maxwell is further delayed.

Please let me know if we can hand-deliver legal mail for Ms. Maxwell to the MDC for direct deposit in the legal mail box.

If so, can delivery to Ms. Maxwell be expedited?

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Bobbi
