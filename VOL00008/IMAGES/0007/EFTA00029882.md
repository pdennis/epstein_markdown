I know you may still be traveling, but I wanted to check in on a handful of outstanding issues. If you're not available, perhaps [redacted] can assist?

- On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us on Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if so, when can we get those materials?
- There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already received them.
- One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet).

In case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received folders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow.

Separately, we're still waiting on answers to the questions from Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24. To refresh, those questions are:

- Comparing your most recent spreadsheet to the prior one, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're looking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), NYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not missing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc.
- As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached spreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

thanks,

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know.

In addition to the pending questions below, we've been advised by the vendor that is reviewing the initial seven devices (that were provided on a per-device extraction basis, as previously discussed) that those materials include approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the attached spreadsheet.

Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

thanks,

This is very helpful, thank you. Comparing this to the prior spreadsheet, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're looking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as:

EFTA00029883

1. NYC024328 (row 10)
2. NYC024367 (row 62)
3. NYC027910 (row 96)

Could you please confirm that I have those additions correct, and that I'm not missing any? And it looks like all of those were included in the drive you provided today.

I also see there are some drives that are still being processed, including NYC024376 through 380 and several drives in NYC024395 – could you please let us know what that means?

Thanks very much, and we'll circle back if any issues with anything we received today, which should get to [REDACTED] in the next day or two.

thanks again,

Here is the up to date spreadsheet. I color coded things to hopefully make it easier. There are 5 items I have to get you (as we discussed this morning) Those should take another day or 2, so looking at Monday/Tuesday for that. Any questions, let me know.
