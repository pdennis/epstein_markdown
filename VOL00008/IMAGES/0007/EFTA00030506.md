I think it is helpful for me to see them so that I am in the loop. But I don't want to slow you down in any way. (You could cc me if that's easier).

Do you want to review those? Or should they go straight to Audrey? I confess, most of the ones we have done historically have been MC related, so they went straight to Audrey, but this one is on Epstein, so if you'd like to see first, let me know.
