Hello

Sorry to bother you on a Sunday. I'm a journalist with the UK's Daily Telegraph.

Is it possible to say, on background, whether you want to question Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell [both British citizens...]

There is also a report in the New York Post that Ms Maxwell is "cooperating with authorities". Can you confirm, on background, if that is true?

Many thanks
