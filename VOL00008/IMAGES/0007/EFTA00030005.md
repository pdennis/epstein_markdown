Great point. Moving forward, we will. I'll make sure these make it into your binder and that you have pdfs of the most recent versions in an updated portfolio.

Here are revised talking points.

FYI, we should give direction at outside that TP's need to be short and crisp, esp for meeting with AG where time is of the essence.

- as requested, I've chopped all the talking points to a page or less (except GEP, which is still much shorter). Happy to further refine.
