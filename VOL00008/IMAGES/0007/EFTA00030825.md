That's the building owned by Mark Epstein (Jeffrey's brother). In the Clear report, attached, apartment 10F is specifically associated with Jeffrey (as well as a few other female names).

Hi Mandy,

Thanks for sending. Do you recognize this address listed on the deed—301 East 66th Street, Apt. 10F, NY NY? If you could check who that is associated with, that would be useful to know, just for background.

Thanks!
