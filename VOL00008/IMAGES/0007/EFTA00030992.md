Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

This letter provides additional discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ("Fed. R. Crim. P."). Based on your request for discovery in this case, today we are producing copies of the materials listed in the below index, which materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_000165541 through SDNY_GM_00174966. A reproduction of materials previously produced by the Government on August 12, 2020, which are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_00086557 through SDNY_GM_00096055 and SDNY_GM_00164920 through SDNY_GM_00165517 is also included. The materials are available for pickup at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.

Materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_00166247 through SDNY_GM_00166273, SDNY_GM_00167093 through SDNY_GM_00167097, SDNY_GM_00167911 through SDNY_GM_00167913, SDNY_GM_00174366 through SDNY_GM_00174369, and SDNY_GM_00174431 through SDNY_GM_00174458 have been designated as "highly confidential" because they contain nude, partially nude, or otherwise sexualized images of individuals.

files are loaded onto an electronic review platform and will be processed and produced on a rolling basis as part of electronic discovery.

Additionally, the Government notes that the physical items referenced in the productions to date can be made available for you to review at the FBI New York office, upon request. Those physical items include numerous hard copies of photographs and discs containing photographs, which were seized during searches of Jeffrey Epstein’s residences. As a courtesy, the FBI is in the process of scanning those hard copy photographs and copying the photographs contained on the discs. Once that process is complete, the Government intends to produce electronic copies of any such photographs that do not contain highly confidential images. Any photographs among those physical items identified as highly confidential will be made available for review at the FBI New York office.

Finally, the Government wishes to inform you, as a courtesy, that it is in possession of a copy of the FBI’s case file regarding the investigation of a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein’s named [redacted] for obstruction of justice (the “[redacted] File”). The [redacted] File is maintained under a different FBI case number from the investigation that led to the charges against your client. The [redacted] File has no relation to your client and no bearing on the charges in this case. Accordingly, the Government does not intend to produce the [redacted] File because it is not discoverable in this case.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI’s custody.

Very truly yours,

AUDREY STRAUSS
Acting United States Attorney
