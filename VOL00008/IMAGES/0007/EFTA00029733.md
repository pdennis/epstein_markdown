Subject: RE: Epstein suicide -- counseling for victims?

With apologies for the weekend email, we have gotten questions from counsel about whether there is any availability for crisis (or other immediate or near-term) counseling for victims, given Epstein's death? My sense is that some victims may be struggling with the idea that their accusations could remain unvindicated as a result of these events. Is there any information we might be able to pass along to them and/or their counsel? I'm also free to discuss via phone if that's helpful ( . Thank you very much!
