Guys – I think these are in great shape. The MILs were a major undertaking (on top of intense ongoing witness prep, getting 3500 etc. out, and the various miscellaneous issues you’ve also had to fend off recently). I hope you can all take a (brief) breath once this is filed, and relish a bit all you’ve already accomplished on the road to trial!
