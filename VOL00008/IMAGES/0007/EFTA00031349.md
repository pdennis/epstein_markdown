Hi ,

Thanks for all your work on this project. I few things from my review, though I'll likely send some additional things tomorrow:

- The folder contains just one report, and I think that goes in the folder instead. Please move it and delete his folder. Same thing for the folder.
- are the same person and the folders can be merged under the name

- [Redacted] is the same person as [Redacted], a potential testifying witness. Could you please move those materials and delete the folder?
- The stuff in the [Redacted] folder should actually go in the [Redacted] folder, and you can delete the one folder once the stuff is moved over.
- In the [Redacted] folder, there's a transcript of a deposition of Mark Epstein. Could you please move that into a new, NTW folder for him?
- [Redacted], [Redacted], [Redacted], and [Redacted]: could you please move these to the not-a-witness folder you created? We'll deal with the contents later, but not in the context of the NTW production.

Thanks!
