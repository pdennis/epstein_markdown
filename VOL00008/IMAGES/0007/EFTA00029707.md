No problem at all – I’m flexible this afternoon, so let me know whenever is good for you and I’ll stop by. Thanks!

Sorry. I’ve been preoccupied- this afternoon?

My chiefs talked with me yesterday about the status of this and I was wondering if I could stop by very briefly when you have a free moment, just to complete the loop? Thanks!

I’m going to make some calls so if I don’t pick up when you call, that’s why, but I’m here and will get off the phone and come down whenever you’re available.

No problem at all, and I’m very flexible tomorrow afternoon – whatever time is good for you I can make work, so just let me know and I’ll put it in the calendar.

Totally understand, and next week would be fine – let me know if it's helpful to set a time, and otherwise I'll touch base midweek if we haven't connected by then.

And thanks very much re: the memo.

Already signed and sent upstairs ... I will do my best to ensure signature immediately.
Re: this afternoon: it may be best to kick it to next week. If some time develops before 3, I'll let you know, but right now it is iffy.

We dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you – we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA approval, but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ approval this afternoon. Thank you!

And separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if that's easier.

thanks again,
