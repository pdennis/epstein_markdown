I know you're traveling this morning, but when we spoke last night we discussed finalizing by this morning your availability for a proffer with [redacted] late next week. Can you please let us know your availability? We are coordinating with her attorney, who has a busy schedule next week, and would like to get something on the calendar.

Thanks,
