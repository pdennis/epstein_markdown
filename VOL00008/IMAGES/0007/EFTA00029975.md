Hi

The two drives from PAE are encrypted, so I can't edit them myself and add the iPhone from the shared. I think it will be fairly easy and quick for me to burn two password-protected discs containing the iPhone images, so if you are okay with me doing so, I'll get started on that. If we produce the PAE drive and the password-protected disc, I'll change the language in the cover letter (defense's is attached) to reflect that.

Below is the chart detailing the Seventh Production, both for your review:

I was just emailing you about this, actually! Would you like the iPhone folder renamed with the same bates stamp it had before (SDNY_GM_SUPP_00219449), or do you want it to have a new bates stamp, as it contains new information? Thanks!

Absolutely! I'll tell him now, and I'll put together a cover letter for defense for your review.

Thanks [REDACTED]

I'd like to get the defense drive out the same day as the defendant's drive. PAE is going to make us another copy for us to keep at 1SA. So please tell [REDACTED] that he can stop copying the defense drive.

Would you please put together a cover letter for the defense for this production?

Hi [REDACTED].

As an update, the PAE drive that will be delivered to Maxwell is ready to go at my desk. The password is WO-6290_20201104 and, if needed, I can prepare a cover letter containing the password to be included separately from the drive.

I've given the other PAE drive to [REDACTED] to start making an internal copy for us. Given the large size of data and massive amount of individual file paths on that drive, he estimates it will take a couple days to make the copy. If a delay in getting the drive to defense is an issue, we can connect with [REDACTED] and see if there is another solution.

Thanks so much! Happy to chat more about this if needed too,

Hi [REDACTED]

This is not time sensitive, so no rush on this at all, but I was going to have [REDACTED] make a copy of the PAE drives for us at some point this week. When you have a moment, please let me know if you're not using one of the drives and (if it's here in the office) I'll give the drive to [REDACTED] to copy for our internal use.

Thanks so much!
