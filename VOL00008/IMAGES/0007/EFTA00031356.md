Hi

Attached is the statement I read – it has not been filed with the Court, so it's not public, but happy to share it to make sure the transcript is accurate. If you need any spellings or clarifications, I'd be happy to provide them. Separately, what is the best way to order a transcript?

Thanks very much--

Hi

May I please have the victim statement that you read for starters and I will reach out with my other spellings that I need if I don't find them in the papers

Thanks,
