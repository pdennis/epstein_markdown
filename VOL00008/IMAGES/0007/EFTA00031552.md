Thanks, [REDACTED] All is quiet on my end. We are having a call with [REDACTED] today at 1:15 to discuss Epstein trust-related matters.

I was thinking about you this morning and hoping that your departure date would not be too soon.

How was your weekend?

Good morning. I hope that you had a nice weekend — and were able to take a break from running(!). Any news of note? None on my end. I'm hoping to speak with [REDACTED] today to sort out the logistics of my departure. And more stuff along those lines.
