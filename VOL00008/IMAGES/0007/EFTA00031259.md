- Admissions records:
- Business records. Doesn’t matter whether student or school actually put the information on the school’s form.
- In any event, “made” by school when received and relied on in ordinary course of business – adopted business records doctrine.
- If must: offering for fact of application, and for the state-of-mind statement that JE was going to pay for her tuition. Not offered for truth: not saying he was actually going to do it.
