I know is last minute and a Saturday but I need to see [redacted] tomorrow at 8:00. Something came up yesterday and today. If you don't get this until Monday, no worries.

Separate question, He has some notes for me. Can he simply give those to me or is this some process we have to go through? It is his handwritten notes
