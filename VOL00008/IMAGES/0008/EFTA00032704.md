Joe,

I think that should work, but let us confer internally and we'll circle back tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, attached please find a blank copy of our standard proffer agreement. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if it would be useful to talk again in the next day or two, and we'll be in touch.

thank you,

Joe,

We ended up slotting in a few things in the interim, but we're still good for 6:30 for sure.

Joe,

Sure, thanks – and yes, quite the weekend. If it’s alright with you, let’s do 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday – you can reach us at [redacted], or we can also call you then if that’s easier, whatever you prefer.

thanks,

Hi [redacted],

No need to take any more time out of what I’m sure was a busy weekend for you. Let’s set a time for Tuesday morning (the earlier the better for me). Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,

Joe

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with [redacted], if that’s helpful. Or if you’d like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thanks,

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented , prior to his passing in 2018. Agent served with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan's former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,
Joe
