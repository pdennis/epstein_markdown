A MESSAGE FROM THE EDITOR

The push to deregulate law firm ownership rules is gaining steam. What makes this time around different? And what would changes in the rules mean for law firms, ALSPs, the Big Four, clients and beyond? With access to justice at its core, these efforts have implications for much more, but many law firm leaders aren't concerned or don't know what they'd do with a cash infusion if they got one. Dan Packel and Dylan Jackson dive into all of these angles, with accompanying pieces from our global newsroom on what the U.S. can learn from jurisdictions that have deregulated and what specific policies are being explored in states across the country.
