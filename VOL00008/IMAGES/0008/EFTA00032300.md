Dear Mr. Sweeney

Ex UK Metropolitan Police detective, Jon Wedger, knows a lot about juvenile prostitution and child sexual abuse in the UK, and the fact that it generates a lot of money for the British establishment. He was persecuted by police and the British government because he was doing a good job, exposing the racketeering involving children's homes and V.I.P.s very high up in British society. He might be useful in your enquiries.

Here is an interview that he gave recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9TscJsVKp4

Procurer of children, Jimmy Savile, was on very close terms with royalty and politicians. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65p8J-WQbKI

The British establishment pushed Chief Constable, Mike Veale, out of his job because he was doing an honest investigation into Jimmy Savile and his high level connections. Mr. Veale felt the need to make a public statement, but he was still kicked out for doing his job. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtWVtH8AuA4

Jimmy Savile was protected by the British government for almost 50 years, and was even sent on 'ambassadorial' missions to Israel. Why? He was a third rate entertainer and no more. He spent 11 Christmases as the guest of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at her country residence, Chequers. He was a frequent guest at Buckingham Palace and, in one public interview, bragged that he had smuggled a small female child into the palace. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM_RlWkE52w
