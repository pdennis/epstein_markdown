Hi

Closing the loop on this--did the interview happen yesterday? We're good to go with the June 25 production from your perspective, right? Do you want to see the production before it goes out?

Thanks,

Sounds fine. Scheduled for June 17 and 22. And if by chance something would get rescheduled, I think we could still go ahead with the production, I'd just want to confirm with supervisors.

Hi

Just checking in—BOP currently has a deadline of June 25 to produce documents without any redactions based on Noel in the Epstein FOIA. Is everything on track in Noel for that date to still work? As in, all interviews or any other processes that could support 7(A) withholdings will be wrapped up by June 25, right?

Thanks,
