Hey there,

Sorry we haven't been able to connect in a while. Are you still able to handle the immunity package for LEXUS and RICO memo for the VICAR murder charge against J-Rock and Sauce? I'm totally swamped with this Epstein stuff and won't be able to turn to that stuff until next week at the earliest. Would be amazing if you could handle.

Thanks very much,
