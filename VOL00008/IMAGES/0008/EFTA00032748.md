Hi guys,

I'm pretty slammed as we're in the thick of a period where we have 23 briefs due in the span of 30 days, plus the usual other appeals stuff going on. I've also never been asked to review an entire RTC like this (neither has Sarah, for what it's worth), so I don't think you'll get much value-add anyway. I want to be helpful, of course, but is there something discrete and tricky you need help with on these?

Thanks,

Hi _______________________________

We just wanted to check in and see if you think you'll have a chance to look at the Maxwell RTC before we send it to the defense. We're planning to do that on October 20, and if you have time to look at this before then, we'd really like to incorporate your comments.

Thanks!

Hi _______________________________

I hope all's well! Attached is a draft of our RTC in the Maxwell case. If you have time to look at it, we'd love any comments you might have.

In terms of timing, we have to file a joint proposed RTC on October 27, so we are thinking of sending this to the defense a week or so before that.
