Hi

Attached is a draft response to their Daubert motion. You'll see some blue highlighting where we're waiting for information from our expert.

As we mentioned earlier, we're planning to get you additional motions in tranches in the next few days, but this is the most complicated one and we need lead time before we can talk to our expert (if needed), so we wanted to get your comments on this first.

Thanks,
