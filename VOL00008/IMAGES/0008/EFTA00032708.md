- our bosses are asking us if we have any better info now about any current phone numbers and/or emails for Epstein, with the hope of getting tolls, subscriber info, heading info, etc. if we can.

In connection with the arrest, did he provide any current contact info? And what was the number for the cell phone that was seized, if we know (and if we don't, could you please send the IMEI and any other identifying or registration numbers)? Thanks very much.
