Hi - just checking in to see if you will be calling me or if there is a dial in? Or maybe you are still busy in court?

Best,

Hi Sigrid,

Attached is a motion that Maxwell's counsel filed seeking to subpoena information from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund, including information about . We intend to file a motion to quash the subpoena later this week. Happy to have a call if you would like to discuss or have any questions.

Separately, can we find a time to talk tomorrow or Wednesday about scheduling? I'll be in court for jury selection, but I'm free during the break from 1-2 p.m. EST or after 5 p.m. EST.

Thanks,
