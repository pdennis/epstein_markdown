Thanks, let’s just hope it’s as off base as it sounds. The reporter is Tom Winter, who correctly reported (even though it was much easier to predict) the Flynn pardon before it happened.

Just FYI. I forget how this went with Di Souza, but there wouldn’t necessarily need to be any communication with us before pardoning one of our defendants, correct?

Normally I wouldn't send something like this because it seems so unlikely, but just FYI — a reporter who's been reliable in the past is hearing "serious rumblings" from the WH about a pardon.
