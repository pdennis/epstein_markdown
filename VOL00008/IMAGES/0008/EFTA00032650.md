Subject: Proposed Budget -- USA v. Maxwell

Here is the budget for the focus group, pretrial juror questionnaire, and feedback on the opening statement and closing argument.

The proposal does not assume we would review and grade the completed juror questionnaires. As I noted in the proposal, the cost is approximately $8,000 per 100 questionnaires as we can grade only 5 or 6 an hour. We have not provided this service in recent cases, e.g., Silver and Skelos. However, we have provided it in earlier cases, e.g., Martha Stewart, where we were also present in court during jury selection.

I am suggesting we hold the focus group on Friday, October 1, subject to consensus among the team. I can be available on other dates as necessary.

Let me know what questions you have.
