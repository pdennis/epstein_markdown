Hi Gloria,

We are find with a conference call this afternoon if that is ok with your client. We can use the below dial-in:

Passcode <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <fcel> <f

And your proposed time for <fcel> interview works on our end.

Thanks,

I have 2 questions. First, would it be o.k. with all of you if we did the call with <fcel> tomorrow at 4P.M. e.s.t as a conference call rather than as a Skype call? We will be in at least 4 different locations and I think it will be easier if we did it that way. If so, please send us the number to dial. Daniel from my co counsel Marianne Wang's office will also be joining us on the call.

have a very tight schedule on Wednesday, because I need to be on a 1 or at the latest 2 P.M. train to D.C. that day. Could we have the meeting from noon to 1 P.M.? My office is only one block away from the FBI meeting.

Gloria,

We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing [redacted], who should be able to hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide [redacted] with your new client's name as it appears on her ID, date of birth, email address, and phone number?

Thanks,
