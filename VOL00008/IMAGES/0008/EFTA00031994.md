You should reach out without me and [REDACTED]. Whenever works for you and [REDACTED] If she declines a voluntary interview, which would surprise me, then let's discuss further before doing anything.

Copy. I can set it up via phone for later this week or next week. [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] can you please give me days and times that work for you? After I have your availability options, I will then call [REDACTED] to schedule.

[REDACTED] if [REDACTED] declines a voluntary interview, do you want me to compel her?

Thank you. The record came from Associate Warden [REDACTED]. Will you please reach out to her, give her the standard voluntariness warning, and ask her where the sign came from? Can you please ask how she got it, whether she took it from the SHU, and when. Can you also ask who created it and hung it up? It is possible she was given this document by someone else and won't know the answer to the majority of these questions. If that's the case, we'll want to find out who had the sign / who knows the information and interview that person. If, on the other hand, she is knowledgeable about the sign (including why it was hung and who took it down and when), [REDACTED] and I will want to interview her by phone. Of course, do a 302/MOI. Thanks very much and let us know if you have any questions.

Ok, thanks. We've asked the FOIA attorney who was the custodian of this record, and once we know, we're going to need to interview that person, which we may ask you to facilitate.

I re-read the FBI 302s and the DOJ OIG MOIs. There was no mention of any signage, posters, written unique instructions, or anything that fit the description of what was provided from you.

Hi folks,

I have a recollection that when we were interviewing employees at the MCC, one or more individuals told us there was a sign posted in the SHU that said to do your checks on Epstein. If memory serves, we never recovered the document. But last week we got a production of records from the BOP as part of FOIA litigation that included the attached. Can you remind us (a) if there was in fact some employee who told us about this sign – I haven’t looked at all the 302s and MOIs, and (b) of anything we did to try to get this sign previously (if we did in fact make inquiries).

Thanks,
