Subject: 8/16 Friday Proffer - Efrain Reyes, GEO

Hi

We are working on the Epstein death investigation and would like to proffer with Efrain Reyes, who was his cellmate up until the day he died. Reyes' lawyer is only available to do a proffer this Friday, and given the ongoing investigation, it will be difficult to make agents available for a takeout order. Would the USM make an exception and produce Reyes for a proffer on Friday? Thanks.
