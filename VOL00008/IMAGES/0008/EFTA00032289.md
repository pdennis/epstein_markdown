' I'm glad you're on it.

I saw you're reservation. I'm going to book something early afternoon and back the same night.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; I am really sorry but I am not going to be able to make it Wednesday. Please apologize to the victims for me. I am working the Epstein death investigation and it's very fast moving. [redacted], their prior statements are saved in the Dutch case file on the shared drive. They wanted the opportunity to go over those, and to have the chance to briefly prep about how to testify and what they may want to say during the sentencing portion. Thank you for going and I'm really sorry to do this.</ksong@fbi.gov>
