PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear [Redacted]

It has been a long time since we were here in [Redacted] together and that meeting is often in my thoughts. I hope that you are all well. I am so grateful we managed to speak despite the pandemic – thank you for travelling to see me. I hope that you received the additional information sent to you a while ago [Redacted].

Please can someone let me know if it is possible to listen in on the trial or get daily transcripts? No one has been in touch with me since we spoke. My understanding was that victims would be kept informed of events? Please can you tell me who I contact?

I specifically wanted to let you know that [Redacted].

I feel that some people don't see me as a real person with feelings. I feel completely exposed to a nightmare that I have been so violently thrown into without my consent or voice... this is one of the reasons why I so appreciated being able to speak with you in order to set the record straight.

Something that struck a chord with me was written by the author Chimanda Ngozi Adichie: 'In this age of social media, where a story travels the world in minutes, silence sometimes means that other people can hijack your story and soon, their false version becomes the defining story about you. The assumption of good faith is dead...'

Yours sincerely,
