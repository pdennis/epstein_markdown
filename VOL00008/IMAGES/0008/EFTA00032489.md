I think one or both of us free for the next hour or so, and then again after about 4:30.

PCers,

SEC called again with some questions on their Epstein inquiry. They mainly want to continue to avoid anything that would be problematic for the criminal case. We thought it would be easiest if some group of the 4 of us got on a call with them.

Do one or both of you have some availability this afternoon?

Thanks,
