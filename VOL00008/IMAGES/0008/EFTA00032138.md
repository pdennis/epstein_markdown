Understood—thank you for getting back to me. I'll be up late tonight, so I'd be grateful if you would please give me a call when you wrap up tonight. I'll be on my cell, which is [redacted] and would appreciate the call.

Thanks very much, Mike.

We are going to be tied up tomorrow morning up until the conference, so it would be difficult for us to meet you. Would you be able to bring the drive into the courthouse with you, so that we can get it from you in the courtroom? If not, would you by any chance be able to put the drive in an envelope marked with my name on it and leave it with security at 1 St. Andrews?

Also, we are still hoping to hear from you about what your team expects to say tomorrow and your position regarding the subpoena we discussed. I’m available for a call any time this evening to discuss.

Best,

[Redacted]

- I will get down to court a few minutes early tomorrow and can hand deliver the hard drive that you gave to us with the first round of production if someone can arrange to meet me outside of the courthouse. Let me know if that works. More broadly, I believe that the Epstein defense team will be in compliance with the protective order by the time we start in court tomorrow and, if not, it will only be a matter of a stray clean up point or two. I’ll give you more details in the morning. Mike
