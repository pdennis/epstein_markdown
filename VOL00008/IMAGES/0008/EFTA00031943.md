&gt;&gt; Hi Mariann,

&gt;&gt; Hope you're well too, thanks. April 1 is pretty full on my end now. Would April 2 work for an interview with this survivor, please?

&gt;&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; I hope you're well. We have another survivor who would like to share her information/what happened to her. If you're willing/open, perhaps we could just add her to April 1st, or let us know what you prefer. She is someone who was abused by Epstein on one occasion in 2004.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thank you,
&gt;&gt;Mariann
