Can I see our original application to Judge Sweet? And I assume there was no transcript before Judge S?

Dumb Q: why does Maxwell have two memos of law?

Per our discussion, I am attaching: (1) Maxwell's two briefs raising the suppression argument; (2) the transcript of the McMahon proceedings and her opinion (Ex D, E, G); (3) our brief (see pp 59-115); and (4) the exhibits we attached to our motion (Ex 4-7). Judge Nathan has said that she will resolve the suppression motions "at a later time" ahead of trial. Thanks very much.

Hi

EFTA00032758

We had an issue come up related to the upcoming suppression hearing (no date set yet, although we expect one) related to Rossmiller/Kramer that we'd like your thoughts on. Let us know a convenient time to stop by over the next few days, thanks.
