Counsel,

We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you today. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production is small enough to produce via the FTP site. Would you please send us a link if that is how you would like us to make the production to you?

We will send a CD with the new production to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. Our paralegals have converted all excel files within this production into PDFs, so your client should be able to review the materials. As always, if you would prefer that she receive the production on a drive, we can either request that the MDC send us one of the drives back to load with the production, or we can load a new drive if you would like to provide us with one.

Best,
