Hi all,

Thank you so much for joining the moot in the Epstein FOIA. We have an all-star cast for this moot. We are a little oversubscribed, so if anyone as a conflict or needs to drop, no problem at all.

The briefing and declarations are attached here. I just sent an invite with the dial-in. I think a few folks from BOP will join as well.

Thanks again,
