Subject: Request for Assistance - United States v. Maxwell

Good afternoon,

I am one of the federal prosecutors handling the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the Southern District of New York under case caption United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). [Redacted] and [Redacted] from the FBI provided me with your contact information and suggested you may be able to assist our team in contacting current and former employees of the Palm Beach Police Department who may need to testify at the upcoming trial in our case. In particular, our team expects to introduce evidence gathered during the PBPD’s investigation of Epstein in 2005, primarily from the search of Epstein’s residence in October 2005, and we will need PBPD witnesses to authenticate that evidence.

Would you be available for a call this week to discuss the particular witnesses we are hoping to contact, please? I can be reached any time on my cellphone at [Redacted], and am also happy to schedule a time that is convenient for a call.

Thank you very much for your help.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
