Hi

Thanks for all your work helping to review documents, it's a big help to the case. As we discussed, there's another set of emails that we've batched out, and it would be great if you could help by taking a few batches – I'm reviewing as well. The batches are under the Epstein SW database, but let me know if you have any issues finding them. As before, this review is just for "hot docs." These items have already been produced in discovery.

Thanks!
