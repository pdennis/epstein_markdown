Hi all,

Please see below. Would one of you please prepare a new CD with a copy of this production dated 5/21/21 and send it to the MDC for Maxwell?

Thanks,

Good morning all,

Inmate Maxwell stated that the discovery disc sent over that is dated 5/21/21 does not work. Our computer services manager looked into the complaints she made, and discovered the disc has a scratch on it. Can you please mail a new one?

Sorry for the hassle!
