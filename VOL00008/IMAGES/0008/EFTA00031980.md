It seems like he checked two name variations for [redacted] but did he separately run her DOB and document numbers in case there are other spellings in the system?

Hey [redacted],

As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. However, if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date range you looking for.

Since [redacted] has two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were provided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel crossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in chronological order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review her travel rather than going back and forth between the two PDFs.

If you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out!
