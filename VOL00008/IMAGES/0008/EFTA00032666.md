Subject: AJN Opinion on Maxwell Motions

Date: Fri, 16 Apr 2021 21:48:09 +0000

Attachments: Maxwell_Opinion_MTD.pdf

AJN's opinion with respect to the majority of Maxwell's pretrial motions is attached. She granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts but denied the remaining motions, except for the suppression motions with respect to the Boies Schiller materials, which she punted on.

There is some mildly positive language in here about our discovery approach in this case, and she notes that our pretrial disclosure schedule is generally reasonable and will allow Maxwell to prepare for trial in July (which hopefully bodes well for the trial adjournment motion).
