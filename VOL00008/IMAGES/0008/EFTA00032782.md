Good afternoon-

I am counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell who will appear in-person tomorrow before Judge Nathan for a 2:30 pm arraignment in Courtroom 24B.

I am requesting that Ms. Maxwell not be brought to the Courthouse in the early morning but closer to noon, if possible.

The government does not oppose this request.

Any accommodation is greatly appreciated.

Please contact me with any questions:

Thank you-

Bobbi
