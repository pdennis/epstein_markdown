Thank you! The issue with production 11 is that defense counsel has expressed difficulty reviewing the metadata on the images contained in the production. In particular, the FBI created the attached spreadsheet, which listed the metadata the FBI was able to extract from the images, but defense counsel has indicated they have no way of knowing which bates numbered image in the production corresponds with which row in the spreadsheet. I'm hoping there's something in the production we can point them to that will help them match up each bates number with each row in the spreadsheet.
