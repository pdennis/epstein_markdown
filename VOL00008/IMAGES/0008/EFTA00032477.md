H[Redacted] – FYI, Congressman Lois Frankel from FL left[Redacted] a VM saying that Congress wants to look into the Epstein case but one of the victim’s lawyers said she should reach out to[Redacted] first. (Unclear how this would fit under her current committee assignments on the Appropriations Committee and Veterans Affairs Committee...) My thought is that this should be routed to OLA and they should handle the request/response in a more formal way; do you have a different view? If you agree, who’s the best person to reach out to? Thanks very much.

This afternoon, I received the attached voicemail on my cellphone. Jack Scarola, who represents[Redacted], had told me that someone from Congress had reached out to him about the Epstein case, and Jack said he’d provided them with my cellphone number.

When would be a good time to discuss?

Thanks,
