Even countries without reported cases of COVID-19 are taking measures and may restrict travel without notice. Please view the Department of State's Travel Advisory Webpage for the most updated information.

EFTA00032480

Should we go ahead and book our travel at this point? If so, should we go through [redacted] or is there someone else we should contact? We have our dates set, so we can submit our paperwork now, but let us know if we should book travel first.
