Subject: Epstein Documents from BOP without Green Watermark

and

I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green marking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the docs, but it looks like not all. Do you have a comprehensive set somewhere?

Thanks,
