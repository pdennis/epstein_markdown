October 9, 2007 -- LAWYERS for Jeffrey Epstein - the billionaire Manhattan investment manager who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes at his Palm Beach mansion in exchange for just 18 months in the slammer - are mulling asking federal prosecutors to drop their demand that he register as a sex offender. In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S. Attorney Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein's lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, writes, "Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both immediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly inappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life to account for his whereabouts." Epstein, a former business partner of Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman, pleaded guilty to a state charge in exchange for the feds' dropping their probe into possible federal criminal violations. Lefcourt argues that only the feds have demanded that Epstein register, "despite the fact that the state was of the view that Mr. Epstein's conduct did not warrant registration." A rep for Epstein had no comment.
