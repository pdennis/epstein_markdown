Hi Ed,

For the Ghislaine Maxwell case, I'd like to request approval to travel with our case agents to Durango, Colorado next week to interview a victim (and potential witness for trial this summer). Because it's a fairly long flight with a layover, the plan would be to fly out on Monday (4/12), conduct two days of interviews to debrief the victim and discuss testifying at trial, and return on Thursday (4/15). Other than flights and a hotel, I don't anticipate any other travel expenses for the trip.

Thanks very much, and hope you're doing well--

Alison
