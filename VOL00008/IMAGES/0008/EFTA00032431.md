Re: FOIA Requests; EOUSA-2019-003546, EOUSA-2019-003548, EOUSA-2019-003549, EOUSA-2019-003550, EOUSA-2019-003551, EOUSA-2019-003552, EOUSA-2019-003553, &amp; EOUSA-2019-003554

Dear FOIA Public Liaison Officer:

This letter is in response to the July 17, 2019 letter regarding the eight above referenced FOIA requests from Assistant Director [REDACTED]. A copy of which is enclosed for your reference.

First, in regard to [REDACTED]. Records concerning [REDACTED] were requested in FOIA requests: EOUSA-2019-003549, EOUSA-2019-003550, EOUSA-2019-003552, EOUSA-2019-003553, and EOUSA-2019-003554 directed toward the United States Attorney’s Offices for the District of New Mexico, Southern District of New York, District of the Virgin Islands, Southern District of Florida, and Northern District of Georgia respectively. We have obtained the necessary authorization (Certificate of Identity, Form DOJ-361) from [REDACTED] for the release of her records to our firm, Boies, Schiller and Flexner LLP, and to me specifically. See the signed authorization form enclosed.

[REDACTED] is our client and we are obtaining her records on her behalf. This is a priority over all other aspects of our record requests contained in the eight referenced FOIA requests. Specifically, records related to complaints filed by her against Jeffrey Epstein in New York are requested on an expedited basis if possible.

Second, in regard to Jeffrey Epstein (DOB: 01/20/1953). Records concerning Epstein were requested in FOIA requests: EOUSA-2019-003549, EOUSA-2019-003550, EOUSA-2019-003552, EOUSA-2019-003553, and EOUSA-2019-003554 directed toward the United States Attorney’s Offices for the District of New Mexico, Southern District of New York, District of the Virgin Islands, Southern District of Florida, and Northern District of Georgia respectively. Subsequent to our original request, Jeffrey Epstein died on August 10, 2019. Given that Epstein died in Federal custody while facing Federal charges, and the resulting media attention, we assume that the Department of Justice is well aware of his death. As Jeffrey Epstein is now deceased, any privacy concerns are extinguished. We therefore renew our request for all records pertaining to

BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP

EFTA00032431

BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER

Jeffrey Epstein. Should you require that we obtain a formal death certificate to proceed, please let us know and we will conduct that exercise.

Finally, we request all public documents concerning the named individuals that may be contained within your files as described by Assistant Director [redacted] in the third paragraph of his letter. We are prepared to pay reasonable duplication fees in an amount not to exceed $500 for any such records.

We reserve the right to supplement this request with additional supporting material as it may become available, and to file a formal appeal should that become necessary. If it is helpful, please free to contact me by telephone at [redacted] or via email at [redacted] to discuss these matters and expedite a satisfactory resolution.

Sincerely,

Date of Receipt: July 1, 2019
Subject of Request: Third-Party Material – Multiple Inividuals

Dear Ms. McCawley:

The Executive Office for United States Attorneys has received eight Freedom of Information Act request that you filed on July 1, 2019, and assigned the above reference numbers to them.

You have requested records concerning third parties. Records pertaining to a third party generally cannot be released absent express authorization and consent of the third party, proof that the subject of your request is deceased, or a clear demonstration that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the personal privacy interest and that significant public benefit would result from the disclosure of the requested records. Since you have not furnished a release, death certificate, or public justification for release, the release of records concerning a third party would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and would be in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. These records are also generally exempt from disclosure pursuant to sections (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C) of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552.

We will release, if requested, any public records maintained in our files, such as court records and news clippings, without the express authorization of the third party, a death certificate, or public justification for release. If you desire to obtain public records, if public records exist in our files, please reply with a letter asking for the public documents. Please send your letter to [redacted].

Should you obtain the written authorization and consent of the third party for release of the records to you, please submit a new request for the documents accompanied by the written authorization. A form is enclosed to assist you in providing us the authorization and consent of the subject of your request. Your name should appear in the section titled “Optional.” The authorization must be notarized or signed under penalty of perjury pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Please send your new request to [redacted].

EFTA00032433

This is our final action on this above-numbered request. If you are not satisfied with my response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, [redacted], or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIAonline portal by creating an account on the following web site: https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home. Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within ninety (90) days of the date of my response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked "Freedom of Information Act Appeal."

You may contact our FOIA Public Liaison at the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request. The contact information for EOUSA is [redacted], [redacted]; telephone at [redacted]; or facsimile [redacted]. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer. The contact information for OGIS is as follows: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, [redacted]; e-mail at [redacted]; telephone at [redacted]; toll free at [redacted]; or facsimile at [redacted].
