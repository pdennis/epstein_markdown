Thanks, [redacted], we could set a time tomorrow if you’ve had a chance to look as well, or we could find a time toward the end of the week if that’s better? I think we have until 8/21 to get comments back.

I’ve reviewed and can discuss whenever.

Team – Attached is a draft of OPR’s report on the Epstein NPA. OPR is asking us to review and provide feedback, if any, particularly in the unlikely event there is anything in here that may be sensitive with respect to an ongoing investigation. Can you please take a look and then let’s find a time to discuss as a group?

Thanks,
