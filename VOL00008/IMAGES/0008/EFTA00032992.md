All -

[REDACTED], [REDACTED] and I have been requested to conduct a number of interviews today of BOP employees regarding the Epstein matter. Please respond if you are available to help us out today. We will figure out the logistics this morning and then let whoever can help out know what's needed...

Thanks!
