Have you guys had a chance to put together a Rule 6(e) application yet? If not, can we try to get that done this week?

Hi

The U.S. Virgin Islands court has recently posted on its website the petition that was filed in the Epstein probate proceedings seeking establishment of a victim claims fund. The petition seeks "expedited approval" from the court to establish the fund, though no timeline is specified. (It is attached, if of interest.) If approved, estate assets would be used to pay for administering the fund, and deadlines would be set for victims to file their claims if they wish to participate.

There was over a week's delay between when the petition was filed with the court and when the court posted the petition on its public page for "cases of interest." That page is not an official case docket, though it has at least select filings from the probate case (though I cannot tell if all filings are being posted). It would obviously be preferable if we had contemporaneous access to a complete docket, but we haven't been able to find a way to access an online complete docket. We're inclined to call the Virgin Islands court to ask whether there's a way to access a full electronic docket, but we wanted to check whether you have concerns before we do so (we doubt we would need to identify ourselves). Let us know your thoughts.

Relatedly, what's the status of the 6(e) order?

Thanks,
