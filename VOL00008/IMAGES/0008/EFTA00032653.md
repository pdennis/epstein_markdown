Hi

Judge Nathan just issued the attached order setting a number of new dates for the Maxwell trial. Would you be able to prepare a new victim notification letter alerting victims to these dates, please?

And thank you SO MUCH for your amazing efforts getting [REDACTED] and her family up to New York. The trip was very helpful ot us and a success overall, so we all feel much better about getting [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] up here again for the trial.

Thanks,
