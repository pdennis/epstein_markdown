When interviewed, he stated he still cannot remember what happened in SHU that caused the marks on his neck. He stated that for the 5 days before that he had only slept about 30 minutes each night because of noise in SHU. He stated he is anxious about going back to SHU because he stated he is going back to a place where he had gotten marks on his neck and he does not know why it happened.

He said he has an appetite and is eating. He said he is waking up every 1 1/2 hours. He stated he feels dehydrated because he is not drinking enough water because he stated he feels he is not given enough bathroom breaks while with his Attorney. Medical was e-mailed with his complaint of feeling dehydrated. He said his Lawyers and friends are all emotionally supportive.

### Subjective/Objective Presentation

The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast.

He stated he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The Psych Observation log noted he talked about life in general population and he slept.

Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse Columbo from Medical had seen him for this.

He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and upsetting that he said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was not able to sleep. The Lt. will be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with the noise of the toilet was similar to when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers.

Current Mental Status: He exhibited a mildly anxious mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech.

He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff and Inmate Companions if he starts to have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff and Inmate Companions if he has these thoughts.

### Intervention(s)

### Progress/Plan

He will remain on Psych Observation in an abundance of caution and pending housing arrangements to be made on Monday. While on Psych Observation, he will be seen daily by Psychology.

## Focus of Session

Inmate Epstein was seen while on psychological observation today in the hospital area.

## Subjective/Objective Presentation

Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow. He then asked if he could remain down here where it is "safe" for the entire week. I told him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because he felt safe or more comfortable for him. It was explained to him that he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU.

According to his log book and eating/shower chart, he has been eating and drinking when not in his legal visits. He has also been writing and attending his legal visits.

## Intervention(s)

Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was somewhat receptive to these interventions, but appears more concerned about getting his various needs in the prison (phone calls, recreation, housing placement concerns, etc.)

## Progress/Plan

He will remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. He will be seen by psychology daily to assess his mental status and psychological functioning.

Risk Factors: He was found by staff in his cell in SHU on 7/23/19 with a string loosely tied around his neck, which Mr. Epstein stated he did not remember anything about.
