Hi all,

[Redacted] and I are heading to Los Angeles in late August to prep with a number of trial witnesses in the Maxwell case. In advance of the trip, I'm going to begin drafting q&amp;as, and it would be super helpful to have a binder with some information about two of the witnesses. When you can, could someone please put together a binder with all witness interview notes and 302s for the following two witnesses? Thanks so much. No labels on the binders needed – just tabs with dates of interviews would be great (e.g., [Redacted], 7-6-19 interview).

These materials should be in their 3500 folders.

Thanks!
