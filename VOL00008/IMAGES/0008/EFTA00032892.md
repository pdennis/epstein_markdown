Subject: Epstein Victim Travel

Judge Berman has scheduled a final conference in the Epstein case at which he will allow victims to be heard before dismissing the case. A number of victims would like to attend, but they are unable to afford travel costs. May we have approval for [REDACTED] to pay for flights and hotels for victims who wish to attend the conference but otherwise cannot afford the cost?
