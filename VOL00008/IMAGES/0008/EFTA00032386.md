HI: I’ve left work for the day and have forwarded this email to [REDACTED]. I am scheduled to do autopsies tomorrow. If [REDACTED] approves, we can approach him about coordinating this. [REDACTED]

&gt; It was relayed that either yourself or reps from your office would like to view the surveillance footage on file for Epstein. The files at this point cannot be viewed outside of FBI space due to software issues. If you would like to view at 290 Broadway please let me know and I will coordinate.
