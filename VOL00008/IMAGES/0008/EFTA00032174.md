Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, this writer instructed R&amp;D staff, as well as the Lieutenant’s Office, to immediately notify the psychology department when he returned from court. Inmate Epstein returned from court after duty hours and denied suicidality. The aforementioned staff notified the on-call psychologist and inmate Epstein was placed on a precautionary psychological observation status until psychology could interview him this morning to conduct a suicide risk assessment.

Inmate Epstein did not exhibit any acute psychopathology and exhibited a clear mental status.

Current Mental Status: Mr. EPSTEIN was alert and oriented. He was polite, calm, and cooperative in demeanor. He exhibited a neutral affect with appropriate range. Eye contact and hygiene were appropriate. The inmate spoke with normal rate, tone, and volume. His thoughts were organized and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial, or irrelevant content. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance, delusional ideation, or a formal thought disorder. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He noted having normal sleeping and eating habits. Mr. EPSTEIN explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent. He was future-oriented and expressed a commitment to life and safety, agreeing to contact staff immediately should he experience suicidal ideation.

## RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ASSESSED:

This writer screened the inmate for a variety of empirically validated factors commonly associated with risk for self-harm and suicide.

The following STATIC risk factors were assessed to be present and increase the inmate's risk for engaging in suicide related behaviors: High Profile Crime, Lack of family connections, Sex Offender status

Of the DYNAMIC risk factors assessed, none were found to be present.

The following PROTECTIVE factors were assessed to be present and may decrease the inmate's risk of suicide: Able to identify reasons to live, Adequate problem solving skills, Denial of suicidal ideation/intention/plans, Future orientation, View of death as negative, Willingness to engage in treatment

As noted above, Inmate Epstein is a 66-year-old Caucasian male. He has various risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with extensive media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which may have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein also informed this writer that his only family at this time is his brother, with whom he does not have a close relationship with.

Despite these risk factors, inmate Epstein possesses a number of protective factors at this time. Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He was very future oriented and requested a strong call, to meet with his attorney, to take a shower, and to brush his teeth. He was eating his cereal when this writer arrived and said "I have my paper spoon here." He reported he is going to have a bail hearing on Monday and believes he is going to be released from jail. Inmate Epstein reported he is a Banker and has a "big business" in the community and that "being alive is fun." He also revealed he enjoys learning and teaching. He has confidence in his attorney and described him as "competent." Inmate Epstein denied any mental health history or history of suicidality. He also reported none of his family members have mental health histories. Inmate Epstein stated he is a mathematician and took post graduate classes in this area of study. Inmate Epstein stated he has a support system in the community, including friends and other associates. Finally, inmate Epstein demonstrated a good sense of humor and did not appear dysphoric, agitated or anxious. No acute psychopathology was noted.

Overall, inmate Epstein has numerous protective factors at this time that outweigh his risk factors for suicidality. He has a positive outlook regarding his legal case, demonstrates no psychiatric symptoms, has no psychiatric or suicide history, and verbalized a desire to be alive at this time and future orientation.
