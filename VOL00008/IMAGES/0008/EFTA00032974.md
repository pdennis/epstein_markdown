Hello, I am a law professor.

I note that the forfeiture is being done under a special Human Trafficking statute. In paragraph 25 of the indictment, you refer to 18 USC 1594(c)(1). But you meant 1594(d)(1). 1594(c)(1) does not exist.

Typos in indictments have disastrous consequences, as I am sure you know. So you might want to correct this.
