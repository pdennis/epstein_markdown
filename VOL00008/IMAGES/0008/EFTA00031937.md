Jeffrey Epstein released from jail today; won't have electronic monitoring device during year's probation

Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, released from jail shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday, will not be tracked by an electronic monitoring device during his one-year probation, according to a court order.

Epstein, who served less than 13 months of his 18-month sentence at the Palm Beach County Stockade, will serve one year of probation at his El Brillo Way home. He already has registered as a sex offender.

In addition, Epstein, who has been out of jail on work release for 16 hours a day, six days a week since October, has been going to his Palm Beach home as well as his West Palm Beach office for the past two weeks.

His attorney, Jack Goldberger, as well as Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office records confirm that Epstein has been to his home on several occasions. Goldberger said Epstein was given PBSO permission to be at home for specific time periods in order to make the transition from jail to his home.

The plea agreement stipulated that Epstein, a billionaire financier, would not be placed on electronic monitoring, Goldberger said. An earlier court order incorrectly had him listed as having to be monitored.

"A very difficult part in his life is ending, and he is looking forward to moving on," Goldberger said.

Epstein, 56, pleaded guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution.

Jeffrey Epstein is whisked away from the Palm Beach County jail in a black car shortly after 6 a.m. today. Epstein left the jail through the sally port, where prisoners are brought in, rather than through the main doors where prisoners are routinely released.

More than a dozen young women, who were minors at the time of their encounters, are suing Epstein for sexual abuse. Among them, Jane Doe No. 3 and Jane Doe No. 5, who both say they fear Epstein and believe he should have gotten a much harsher sentence. Both women have filed federal lawsuits.

Doe No. 3, who was 15 at the time of her encounter with Epstein, said she was shocked to learn Sunday that the Palm Beach resident was getting out of jail early. She said she also didn't find out he was on work release until months after the fact.

"I'm scared to go to Palm Beach because I'm afraid of seeing him out in public," said Doe No. 3, now 21. "They say, 'once a sex offender, always a sex offender.' What makes them think he won't do it again? I'm afraid for future victims. I believe every one of his victims is grieving and the justice system did not do justice for his victims."

Doe No. 5 was 16 at the time of her one encounter. She is now 22 and has a young daughter, whom she wants to protect.

"It's really upsetting to me," she said. "I'm scared. He's such a powerful man, and I don't know what he's capable of. I would have liked to see him get a longer jail term. He just got a slap on the wrist and what he has done to all of us is never going to leave us."

She said that she gets upset when she hears people accuse the victims of being all about the money.

"It's about getting justice," she said. "He's acting like he's the victim and he walks away. I couldn't talk about it for a long time. I have flashbacks. I thought it was all my fault for a long time and that's the way he wanted me to feel."

Miami attorneys Adam Horowitz and Stuart Mermelstein represent Jane Does No. 2 through No. 8 in federal lawsuits.

"We're outraged that a registered sex offender has such a short sentence," Horowitz said. "They put people in jail for longer periods of time for much lesser offenses. Through his guilty admission he has acknowledged that he's a sex offender. Our clients have a life sentence of dealing with his abuse and he gets a slap on the wrist."

West Palm Beach attorney Spencer Kuvin represented Jane Doe No. 1, who has settled her lawsuit. Kuvin said he could not disclose the amount because of a confidentiality agreement. But he did say that she didn't want to be in the public eye anymore.

"She was not happy with the resolution," Kuvin said, "but she wanted it over. He's got investigators in the civil cases trying to dig up dirt on every one of his accusers. The disgusting thing is that he pleads the fifth on everything that's been asked of him and now he

"A man with unlimited wealth can hire people to follow her, dig into every crevice of her personal life and re-victimize her all over again. A convicted pedophile released on the streets? This would never, ever happen if this was someone of normal or lesser financial means. He absolutely got special treatment because he's wealthy."
