All,

Attached please find a prosecution memorandum requesting authorization to seek a superseding indictment charging Maxwell with additional criminal offenses. For reference, I have also attached the two prior prosecution memos regarding the original indictment in this case. We have tentatively scheduled grand jury time for Monday, March 29th.

Thanks,
