5. **COUNTS**: The utmost precaution should be utilized when staff are conducting a count. Staff are to ensure they are observing a real person and not a "DUMMY". When conducting a count, the staff members will ensure that they personally observed breathing human flesh for each inmate counted. All counts shall be double counted by two staff members and both staff shall print and sign their names to the count slip. Inmate details of more than five inmates shall also be double counted. Official counts will be conducted at the following times:

12:00 AM
3:00 AM
5:00 AM
10:00 AM (Weekends and Holidays, only)
4:00 PM
10:00 PM

**The 4:00 PM, 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM counts are MANDATORY STAND-UP COUNTS.**

The master count sheet is obtained using Sentry transaction PPE1. In the event that SENTRY is down, the Control Room Officer shall prepare an error free master count sheet (Attachment 1).

At a minimum, two officers will count each unit. One officer will count while the second officer stands in a position to observe the movements of inmates. Upon the completion of the first count, the officers will change positions and the second officer will count. At the end of the second count, the count will be called into the Control Room for acceptance. There will be no movement of inmates during the count. While counting, officers will not permit anything short of an emergency to distract them. The officers who conducted the count will remain in the area until the count has been cleared by Control. When counting at night, flashlights should be used judiciously, but enough light should be shown on the inmate as to leave no doubt that the officer is counting a breathing living human body.

**A. LOCK-DOWN ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK**: A lock-down accountability check will be conducted at this institution a minimum of once per month. The accountability check will be announced over the public address system at a random time and date with no prior notification to the various departments. This procedure is used to determine if inmates are authorized to be in the respective areas:

Although not designed to be strictly a head count, every effort should be made to arrive at a total institution head count. If this is not accomplished within a reasonable length of time, the Warden may resume normal operations with the understanding there is an accountability problem which needs to be corrected.

Upon hearing the announcement for an accountability check, staff will secure all entrance and exits. No inmate movement will be allowed following the announcement. Staff members will

survey their areas of supervisory responsibility and verify that only authorized inmates are present.

The following information will be gathered from each area and reported to the Lieutenant’s Office. This form is to be reproduced locally from the Correctional Services Manual (Attachment 2).

1. Total number of inmates present who are authorized.
2. Total number of inmates present who are unauthorized, including names and register numbers.
3. The total number of inmates who are unauthorized to be missing, including their names and register numbers.

The above information will be placed on the Lock Down Accountability Check form and the form will be submitted to the Lieutenant’s Office immediately. A Lieutenant will be responsible for supervising the accountability check and documenting the results (i.e., time involved, discrepancies noted, action taken, etc.).

**DURING A LOCK DOWN ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK, INMATES WILL BE QUICKLY LOCATED INTO A CENTRAL AREA AND COUNTED. ALL INMATE MOVEMENT WILL CEASE AT THAT POINT UNTIL THE CENSUS COUNT HAS BEEN CLEARED.**

Inmates on the elevator will be transported to a safe location where no separatee exists.

B. **BED BOOK COUNTS**: The Bed Books will be utilized for emergency counts, bad institutional counts and random Bed Book counts requested by the Shift Lieutenant. When a unit has two consecutive bad counts, a bed book count must be conducted. In conjunction with the Bed Book the unit roster will be used to conduct these counts. Upon receiving a new inmate on the unit, the unit officer will receive two 3 x 5 cards, one to be utilized for the bed book, and the other to use for inmate movement. The bed book card is not to be removed from the bed book.

C. **OFFICIAL COUNT FORMS/COUNT SLIPS**: All official count forms prepared by the Control Room Officer will be in ink. The count verification on all official count slips and forms will be in ink. All count slips are to be prepared in ink without error and forwarded to the Control Room Officer. Completed count slips, out count sheets, and official count sheets will be retained for 30 days. (Attachment 5)

**AT LEAST ONE OFFICIAL COUNT ON THE E/W AND M/W SHIFT WILL BE TAKEN AND VERIFIED BY A LIEUTENANT ON DUTY.**

D. **OUT COUNTS**: Out counts will be kept to a minimum. Staff who will have inmates out of quarters at count time must sign their out count sheet prior to submission to the Operations Lieutenant for approval, the out count (Attachment 4) must be forwarded to Control Room forty-five (45) minutes prior to the official count time. All out counts of more than five inmates will require two staff members to conduct the count utilizing detail cards for identification.

The Control Room Officer will check each out-count sheet by verifying the unit assignment as reported to ensure accuracy, and notify the Operations Lieutenant of any out count which appears to have discrepancies. All out counts will be approved by the Operations Lieutenant. (Attachment 6)

E. **CENSUS CHECKS**:

All departments must conduct a census of all inmates assigned to their area and/or detail during each work period (AM and PM). Census checks will be conducted at approximately 8:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M., Monday through Friday. The Control Center will announce over all radio channels to begin conducting the census. The results of the AM and PM census checks will be documented in the unit officer’s log book (ex., Unit 5-South AM Census completed with zero absent and zero unauthorized). Departments not having a log book will document census check results on the Summary of Daily Census Form (Attachment 4). This procedure is designed to determine whether or not inmates are authorized to be in a respective area. The Control Center will report any discrepancies to the Lieutenant’s Office immediately.

F. **LOCKDOWN CENSUS COUNTS**:

At the Lieutenant’s direction, Control Center will announce over all radio channels a Lockdown Census Count. The results of this count will be called into the Lieutenant’s Office. The Internal Officer will distribute the Lockdown Accountability Census Detail Form (Attachment 2). All unit officers and detail supervisors will complete Attachment 2 and forward to the Lieutenant’s Office. This procedure is designed to determine whether or not inmates are authorized to be in a respective area.

6. **DAILY ACCOUNTABILITY CHECKS**: It is the responsibility of the Activities Lieutenant to inspect, a minimum of 25% of all work details must be conducted per week.

All details must be checked within a 30 day period. A detail roster will be utilized to conduct this inspection. When inspecting the detail cards, the Activities Lieutenant will look for proper identification and accurate information on the face of the card.

The Activities Lieutenant will ensure that each inmate assigned to the detail has a card and all inmates are physically accounted for. The Activities Lieutenant will be required to submit all discrepancies in writing to the Chief Correctional Supervisor’s office. (Attachment 7)

7. **DAILY TRANSFER SHEET**: The Control Room Officer will be responsible for generating the Daily Transfer Sheet Change Sheet, Monday through Friday. The procedure to complete this task is done by performing Sentry Transaction PPF6, followed by Sentry Transaction PP48. This will delete the Call-Outs, and Changes from the previous day. The Control Center will maintain a running master base count worksheet (Attachment 8) that will be used to track and edit all movement in the institution.

After the PPF6 and PP48 are completed then proceed to Sentry Transaction PP39. The PP39 will be all the Call-Outs and Changes for the proceeding date. The following morning at 0001, the Morning Watch Officer will perform Sentry Transaction PPF6, with the future date, this will program the future changes in Sentry. If there are no changes for any given day, on the last page of the call-out, the last remark will be; Transaction Successfully Completed.

8. **CALL-OUTS**: Sufficient copies of the master call-out sheet for distribution to all units will be copied and forwarded to the Control Center Officer so that the Morning Watch Control Center Officer can place one in each detail pouch. Extra copies of the call-outs will be placed at the detail pouch cabinet. Unit officers will post the call-out in the housing units.

The employee who places an inmate on call-out must ensure the requested inmate arrives at the specified time. If the inmate does not arrive as scheduled, the requesting staff member shall contact the staff member responsible for the inmate’s accountability. It is the responsibility of the staff member or department to prepare an incident report for inmates who fail to report for a call-out or is found to be in an unauthorized area. If efforts to locate the inmate fail, the inmate shall be immediately reported to the shift lieutenant as missing and appropriate action initiated to locate the inmate.

9. **PASS SYSTEM**: MCC New York does not utilize a pass system for inmate movement. With the exception of work calls and scheduled mass movement, inmates within the confines of the institution will be escorted by a staff member with the use of a picture on a 3x5 card.

A. **GATE PASSES**: All gate passes must contain the following information: Inmate’s picture, custody classification, work assignment, offense, and sentence. Each card shall be signed by the Chief Correctional Supervisor and the Associate Warden responsible for Correctional Services, each card will also be stamped with an imprint seal and laminated for durability. The imprint shall cover a portion of the inmate’s picture to prevent tampering with the gate pass. The Chief Correctional Supervisor will maintain accountability of blank gate passes. When a decision is made to permanently remove an inmate’s gate pass, the Chief Correctional Supervisor will forward the gate pass to the Cadre Unit Secretary for proper disposal. The Cadre Unit Secretary will keep a log accounting for the issuance and disposition of all gate passes.

Detail supervisors are held responsible for inmates whose cards are included in the respective crew kits, and for accountability of the crew kit while checked out from the Control Center Officer. A Lieutenant will monitor this procedure for compliance. The crew kits will include a SENTRY printout of the specific detail roster. All crew kits will be returned to the Control Center Officer at the end of the work day; all cards must be included in the crew kit. Inmates shall never be allowed to handle detail/crew kit cards.

The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will receive the SENTRY transactions from the Control Room Officer; this will include the Daily /Transfer sheet (PP39) and SENTRY Detail Roster.

All inmates’ current job, housing, and custody assignments will be updated daily by the Morning Watch Control Center Officer. The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will place the new detail roster into the detail pouches daily. This roster will inform the Detail Supervisors of any changes which may affect an inmate’s status on his crew.

The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will perform the following tasks:

a. Insert any new detail cards into the appropriate kit.
b. Remove any detail cards of inmates who have transferred out of the institution or have been removed from that detail. These cards will then be forwarded to the Lieutenant’s Office.
c. Check each detail to ensure that each inmate on the SENTRY roster has a picture card in the crew kit.
