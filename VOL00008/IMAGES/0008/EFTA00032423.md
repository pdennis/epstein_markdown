Thanks for letting me know. Monday should be ok, but I’m reluctant to let this spill over much later, since we do have the pending request. I’m sure you understand.

I have now had the opportunity to discuss this request with both [Redacted] and our [Redacted] and I am renewing my request that you provide a list of the specific documents and other materials that you are requesting the OCME not disclose. Additionally, I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you briefly concerning the document that you have requested that OCME destroy, and that OCME has deactivated in the manner that I described to you last week. Please let me know when would be convenient for you; thanks.
