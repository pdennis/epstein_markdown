In particular, there appears to be a track change that is included in the second page, which we are hoping you could fix before we submit this to Judge Nathan.

We also were hoping to chat about some other issues, but even if that's not possible, we're hoping we can provide the court with a clean copy without the track change.

Thanks,

Hi all,

Today our office is sending via FedEx a replacement drive for Ghislaine Maxwell, which should arrive at the MDC tomorrow. This drive will replace the drive that Maxwell recently dropped and broke, and the accompanying cover letters are attached. Would you please make sure Maxwell is given access to this drive?

Would you please mail the broken drive back to our office? It can be mailed to the below address:

, Paralegal Specialist
U.S. Attorney's Office, SDNY
New York, NY 10007

Thanks very much, as always, for your help.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
