Good Morning:

I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference?

Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom every hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate?

Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch which is sent up from food service every morning.

Please provide a response.

Thank You,
