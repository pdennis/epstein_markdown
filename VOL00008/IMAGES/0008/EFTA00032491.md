Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we’d like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we’re still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and _________________________________________________________________________ or _________________________________________________________________________ and _________________________________________________________________________, but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren’t doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we’d like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
☐
