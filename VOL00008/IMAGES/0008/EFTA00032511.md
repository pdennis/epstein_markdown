Unfortunately I'm in the grand jury and meetings most of the afternoon, but I'll be free (and in the office) anytime this evening starting at 5:00, or could talk anytime tomorrow before 2:00. What works best for you?

thanks,

I am one of the AUSAs working on the current investigation of Jeffrey Epstein in the Southern District of New York, and I was given your contact information by [redacted] and so wanted to be in touch for any deconfliction or discussion that might be useful with respect to our respective matters. Is there a good time to be in touch sometime this week? I should generally be able to make myself available at your convenience, and please let me know if any information would be helpful in advance.

thank you,
