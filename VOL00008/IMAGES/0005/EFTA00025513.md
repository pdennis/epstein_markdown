Adding to this, if you could please bring any personal effects seized at the arrest (money, wallet, whatever) -- not including the devices we have search warrants for -- we can return that to his lawyers tomorrow. Thanks.

Hope you had a good flight back. Could you please bring Epstein’s Austrian passport to court tomorrow? His attorneys have asked to inspect it. Let us know if that causes any issues (with chain of custody, for example) and we can discuss.

Thanks!
