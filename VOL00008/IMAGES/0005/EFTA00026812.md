Counsel,

Attached please find a letter responding to your correspondence of September 21, 2020 and October 1, 2020 regarding the above-captioned case.

As noted in this letter, today the MDC approved the Government's request to allow an FBI agent bring a secure laptop to the institution for you to review with your client, so long as no other electronic devices are brought into the room with the secure laptop. Please let me know what day or days you would like to schedule such a visit for next week, and I will coordinate with the FBI and the MDC to arrange the visit.

Best,
