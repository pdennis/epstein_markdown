We're glad that information is helpful, and we appreciate you checking in with us on this – thank you. We do not believe that asking victims about their past contacts with the USAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA in or about 2005-2008 would present any issues for our office, we would just respectfully ask that any such discussions avoid addressing the substance of the underlying criminal scheme (including the victims' personal experiences and interactions with Epstein or his associates). And if those topics unavoidably arise despite not having been raised by OPR, we'd ask that you please let us know so we can incorporate any such witness statements as 3500 material as appropriate and required. But please let us know if that poses any issues on your end.

thanks again,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York

Thank you, . This is sufficient; no need for you to do anything further.

I want to assure you that in reaching out to and possibly interviewing the victims regarding their past contacts with the USAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA, OPR wishes to in no way interfere with anything your office may be doing currently or anticipates doing in the future. Please confirm that our doing so does not present any issues for your office. If you have any concerns in that regard, please let me know so we can discuss the matter. I hope I might hear back from you by midday Wednesday if possible.

Best regards,

Thanks for following up, and as discussed we are able to advise OPR regarding the individuals on your list whom we understand to be represented by counsel. I'm happy to speak with you via phone at your convenience, but in the first instance, because the overwhelming majority of the individuals on your list are represented by counsel, attached is a spreadsheet with the relevant information. The spreadsheet represents our best and current understanding—it is of course possible that individuals have changed their counsel very recently, but this should hopefully at least get you started.

As reflected in the spreadsheet, of the 32 individuals you listed, 22 are represented by Brad Edwards, of Edwards Pottinger LLC; two are represented by Jack Scarola, of Searcy Law; one is represented by Sigrid McCawley, of Boies Schiller; one is represented by Rita Glavin, of Seward &amp; Kissel LLP, and one is represented by Gloria Allred, of Allred, Maroko &amp; Goldberg. Of the remaining five, four we have been unable to connect with (at least at the AUSA level), and one we believe is deceased. The contact information for the attorneys is the following:

Brad Edwards

Jack Scarola

Sigrid McCawley

Rita Glavin

Gloria Allred

Please let me know if it would be helpful to chat, and thanks as always.
best,

As you and I have briefly discussed OPR wishes to conduct brief interviews, on very limited and historical matters, with a number of individuals who may be involved in matters you have under investigation, who are listed below. You offered to advise us which of the individuals you know to be currently represented by counsel, and who those counsel are. For efficiency's sake, I would like to schedule a phone call with you for that purpose. Please let me know when you might be available.

As are so many of us, I'm teleworking, but available to speak at pretty much any time of the workday.

With regards,

Counsel
