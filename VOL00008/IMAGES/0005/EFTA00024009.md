Dear House of Commons,

This may have to be directed to the Treasury Select Committee, or the information could be found in the email archive of John Mann or Mark Garnier held by Parliament.

On 2nd Nov 2015, The Times reported that the Daily Mail had been leaked emails from Jeffrey Epstein to Parliament or some connected source to blackmail Parliament into accepting Jes Staley as CEO for Barclays. Subsequently in August 2019 it was reported by Bloomberg that Staley had visited Epstein in prison and also on his island, travelling to the latter on Epstein's yacht.

In the Daily Mail article John Mann MP and Mark Garnier MP were reported to have told the Daily Mail that Staley ought to face a grilling session as a result of the threats Epstein was alleged to have made to blackmail Parliament to accept his friend Staley as CEO of Barclays.

1. I would like a copy of any email disclosed to Parliament by the Daily Mail that forms the basis of these allegations
2. The recipient list of the emails, and any other meta data in the original copies sent to Parliament or the Treasury Select Committee or its members.

Yours faithfully,

EFTA00024009
