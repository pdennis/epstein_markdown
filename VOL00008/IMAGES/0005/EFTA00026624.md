Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with Ms. [redacted], if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York

Mr. [redacted]

My former partner, [redacted], represented [redacted] (now known as [redacted]), prior to his passing in 2018. Agent [redacted] served Ms. [redacted] with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as [redacted] former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,
