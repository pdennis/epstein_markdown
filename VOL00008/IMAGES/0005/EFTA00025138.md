Thanks for sending. Attached is our section added at the end. I did add a heading to make clear where the "Government Position" starts.

If you want to make any changes to your section as a result of what we wrote, just shoot me a copy before you file so I can see if that changes any of our positions.

Thanks,

Checking in to see if you guys have your scheduling position statement ready for the joint letter. If you do, can you please shoot it to us, and we can insert our segment to return to you. You can then let us know if you change anything for us to review before we agree to sign off on filing.
