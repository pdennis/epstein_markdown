Hi

We don't have this document -- it sounds like it's an unsealed filing from a civil suit, and those filings are voluminous, so we don't know which document that is (we're not tracking the unsealed documents).

Thanks,

Rather than ask this reporter for a copy of the doc (below), would you happen to have it? Main is asking. Thanks.

+SDNY team. If you don't have copy of this civil litigation filing reporter is referencing, can you ask reporter for copy of doc?

Inquiry:
Hello, I'm a journalist with the Daily mail and am looking to find out if you have any comment on the claim in newly unsealed court documents that Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz put pressure on the DOJ to give Jeffrey Epstein a favorable plea deal in 2007. The documents were unsealed in a civil case brought by an Epstein victim, against Ghislaine Maxwell, his alleged madam. Please email or call me on
