That's obviously disappointing but not hugely surprising – she was on a warpath about us meeting with that client, who says she saw PA dancing in the club. Not an obvious federal crime! We also corresponded about this a little ago in the attached.

However, searching back for this stuff also reminded me that we never heard back from them on CDB, so just sent a reminder email on that.
