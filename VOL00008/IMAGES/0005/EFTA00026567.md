Team,

In their motion on the NPA, the defense cites to this privilege log that SDFL filed in a civil case to support their assertion that their investigation was coordinated with our office. On page 5 (see attached), there's an entry that reads:

File folder entitled "____________________" containing attorney (____________________) handwritten notes

I have no idea who this is, and a google search for this person yields no hits. No hits on the NY attorney registration page, and no hits on SDNY ECF. Aside from emailing Ed to ask if he can find out if anyone with this name (or close to this name) ever worked at SDNY, I'm not sure what other steps to take. Thoughts?

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
