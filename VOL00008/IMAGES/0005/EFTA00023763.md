Okay, great. Thanks. Very frustrating given the history, but hopefully we now have everything (and everything done correctly).

FYI below, the FBI says its dropping off extractions of nearly all the remaining devices tomorrow. Why after ten months of nothing we were able to get literally everything in a week is absolutely beyond me, but hopefully the data they get us is correct, accurate, and workable. We should be able to get the drive sent to [copied here] tomorrow, and then if it all looks okay, likely out to [for processing and upload next week]. Will keep everyone posted as always.

Thanks very much for letting us know, that's very helpful. After you finalize and drop off the drive, if tomorrow you could please send us a scrubbed and updated spreadsheet, so we can match up everything we're working with, that would be extremely helpful.

thanks again,

The last item is currently copying to the drive [redacted] gave me for submittal to Southern. Unfortunately, the copy will take several more hours, so it will not be available today, but will be 1st thing tomorrow morning. This

EFTA00023763

includes all outstanding items except the 2 servers that need hardware data recovery. I'll drop the drive off tomorrow morning. Let me know if you need anything else.
