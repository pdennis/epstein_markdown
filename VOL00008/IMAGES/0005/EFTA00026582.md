Hi RMP,
Please see the attached ECC request package for AUSA
If required, please inform the traveler how to determine who the POC is for this trip.
Please advise the traveler of any additional steps they may need take.

Hi
Please let EOUSA know if you have checked to see if a visa is required for your destination.
View the state dept. link for the country you are traveling to visa link for the country you are traveling to.
Visa policies may be found on the Department of State's website or on the website hosted by each country's embassy.
https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country.html
Traveler, Consult EOUSA mailbox to obtain a visa for you.
To provide sufficient time for the State Dept. to issue the authorization letter and for the foreign government to process the visa
request, it is recommended that visa request package be submitted to EOUSA's RMP Travel.
Staff 15 business days prior to the proposed date of departure.

Thank you
