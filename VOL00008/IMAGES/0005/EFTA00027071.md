Thanks very much [REDACTED] The MDC cover letters look good to me. Please just change the date to 10/20 because these will go out tomorrow.

I've revised the counsel cover letter to incorporate some language that [REDACTED] and I previously discussed. The revised version is attached here [REDACTED] any edits to this before it goes out tomorrow?

Thanks again,

Subject: 5th Production cover letters

Hi, all!

I'm preparing the 5th Production to go out today, and I've attached the cover letter for defense counsel and two cover letters for Maxwell (one main cover letter to be included with the drive sent to MDC, and one letter containing the password to be sent in a separate envelope to MDC). Please review at your convenience; once you approve, I'll have both drives sent out.

Thank you very much!
