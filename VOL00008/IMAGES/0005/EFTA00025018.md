Hi [REDACTED]

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem?

In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

Thanks,

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George,

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for any students at Interlochen?

Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues [redacted] and [redacted] (both cc'd) should be able to coordinate with you as needed.
