Sure, just maybe ask him for his availability when you respond about the interview, and I can do the call with him.

&gt; Agree. I'm swamped for most of next week (except Friday). Any chance you could take the lead on that pre-call please?

&gt; A short pre-call with his attorney next week before the interview would probably be helpful.

&gt; A fair amount we will have to deal with from this, but not urgent.
