Subject: Phone Numbers Searched in Relativity

Good evening-

Regarding the list of numbers to be queried in Relativity I've completed the first 4. There are several "hits" but not all are exact matches and need to be sorted through.

I organized the info in a Word Doc reflecting results under the first section US vs Epstein as "JE" and the second part with the search warrants as "JE SW". Each positive match has the control number and a brief description of what it consists of.

As I continue to work on it I will send it with updated results.

Thanks,
