been discussing your relationship with a . You used the phrase in your testimony earlier, you used the phrase "eat out." Could you describe what that phrase means in the context that you were using it?

MR. SCAROLA: We will stipulate that what it means is cunnilingus.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. Okay. Do you know what a sex toy is?

MR. SCAROLA: Could you explain what relevance or materiality your understanding of that line --

MR. LUTTIER: Sure. It was --

MR. SCAROLA: -- of questioning might have since there is no allegation that sex toys were ever employed in encounters between and Mr. Epstein?

MR. LUTTIER: Well, I dispute that for sure. I just tell you if you read the record carefully, you will find out that is not at all

true, and that's why it is relevant. Come up many a time.

MR. SCAROLA: In connection with allegations from ?

MR. LUTTIER: There and in the IME.

MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, if you represent, if you represent that that's the case, then proceed.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. Do you know what a sex toy is?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And what is your understanding of that term so that we are understanding each other when I ask you these questions?

A. I guess toys used doing sexual things.

Q. Okay. And that would include, for example, vibrators?

A. Yes.

Q. Dildos?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you used sex toys in the past?

A. No.

Q. Never?

A. Never.

Q. Either -- how about with ?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever tell anybody you had?

A. No.

Q. Did you, did you ever use any sex toy with Jeffrey Epstein?

A. He tried to use a massage thing and I told him no.

8 Q. What did you mean by "massage thing"?

9 A. Whatever it was in the hell that he had.

10 Q. Well, what -- describe what you are

11 talking about.

12 A. I just told you.

13 Q. Well, massage thing doesn't tell me

14 anything. What are you talking about?

15 A. I don't know what it was called. I don't know

16 what it is.

17 Q. What did it look like?

18 A. It looked -- it was -- I don't know. It

19 vibrated. It looked like it was a neck massager.

20 Q. But do you know, do you know -- can you

21 describe, physically describe how big it was, what

22 color it was, what it looked like? Can you describe

23 anything about it?

24 A. It was gray and do you want me to draw you a

25 picture because I don't know how to describe what it

0172

1 looked like.

2 Q. How large was it?

3 A. It was like this big (indicating).

4 Q. Okay.

5 A. It was like a neck massager.

6 Q. You know like -- you know what Brookstone

7 is, a store?

8 A. Yeah.

9 Q. Have you ever been in there and they have

10 these massages that, like you can reach behind your

11 back and stuff like that. Are we talking about

12 something you know, like that?

13 A. Yeah, but it didn't have a wire, an electrical

14 wire.

15 Q. Okay.

16 A. It was like battery operated.

17 Q. And you say that Mr. Epstein tried to use

18 this on you and you said no?

19 A. Yeah.

20 Q. And then he --

21 A. That was the end of that.

22 Q. -- didn't use it?

23 A. He did not, and he's never, it never was

24 brought up again.

25 Q. Have you ever desired to use any kind of

0173

1 sex toy?

2 A. No.

3 Q. And, and then not done it for some reason?

4 A. No.

5 Q. Okay. Back to [redacted]. How many

6 sexual encounters would you estimate you had with [redacted]?

of frequency did you and she have a sexual relationship?

MR. SCAROLA: Those are two different questions, compound.

THE WITNESS: What does this --

MR. LUTTIER: With what --

THE WITNESS: What does this have to do with me and Mr. Epstein?

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. With what degree of frequency did you and have sexual relations?

MR. SCAROLA: That's the second part of the question that you asked.

MR. LUTTIER: That's the question. I will break it up then.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. You've testified earlier that you and had sexual relations?

MR. SCAROLA: We'll stipulate that that occurred on multiple occasions.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. All right. Tell me with what degree --

MR. SCAROLA: And beyond that an inquiry is intended for no other purpose except to annoy, harass, and embarrass.

MR. LUTTIER: With all due respect, I disagree. So, I am going to ask my question.

MR. SCAROLA: And I disagree with your disagreement. And I will instruct her not to answer.

MR. LUTTIER: Okay. Let me get the question out.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. On how many occasions did you and have sexual relations?

MR. SCAROLA: And the stipulation is that it occurred on multiple occasions and beyond that no relevant inquiry can be made.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. And when, when your lawyer stipulates that

it's multiple occasions, if you had a relationship with her for 12 months, can you estimate how many times it was?

A. I refuse --

MR. SCAROLA: Don't answer that question.

THE WITNESS: -- to answer.

MR. LUTTIER: And you refuse to answer --

MR. SCAROLA: Because her lawyer has instructed her not to answer because the question is obviously intended, after the stipulation, for no other purpose except to

annoy, embarrass, and harass the witness.

MR. LUTTIER: It's, it's not intended to be annoying. I believe the degree of frequency is absolutely relevant in the case.

MR. SCAROLA: To what -- to which element?

MR. LUTTIER: Arguable -- well --

MR. SCAROLA: To which element?

MR. LUTTIER: I don't want to --

MR. SCAROLA: To which element of the offense?

MR. LUTTIER: I am not going to argue my case to you, but it absolutely has an effect on the alleged claim of damages. Beyond that I don't need to tell you the theory of my case

but --

MR. SCAROLA: I disagree.

MR. LUTTIER: Okay.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. Do you, do you -- how did your relationship with [redacted] end?

A. I met my son's father.

Q. Who is [redacted]?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did your relationship with [redacted] end on an amicable basis?

A. What does that mean?

Q. Well, did you she and she both agree you were going to go your separate ways --

A. Yeah.

Q. -- or did you just cut it off?

A. We agreed we would go separate ways.

Q. Did you have [redacted] name or any portion of her name tattooed on your body?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you have tattooed on your body?

A. [redacted].

Q. And when did you have that done?

A. While we were -- when I turned 18.

Q. So, it would have been about six years, five years after your relationship ended?

A. Yeah.

Q. And why did you have her name tattooed on your body five years after you ended your relationship with her?

A. Because I felt like it.

Q. Did you ever rekindle your relationship with [redacted] --

A. No.

Q. -- after you, after your 13th birthday?

A. No.

Q. Did you maintain contact with [redacted]

Q. -- as a result of her performing? Did you at any time during the 15 or 20 minutes that she was on you say anything to her?

A. Yeah, I told her to stop.

Q. And when did you tell her to stop?

A. After like 15 minutes, I told her to stop and that I felt uncomfortable.

Q. And what did she do?

Q. While she was kneeling?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did you say anything to Mr. Epstein?

Q. Which you said after 15 minutes, right?

A. Yeah.

Q. How about during the first 15 minutes, did you say anything at all?

A. No.

Q. Did you say, you know, I am uncomfortable with the set-up; I want to leave?

A. I just said no.

(Interruption at the door.)

MR. LUTTIER: At the time --

THE WITNESS: Can you not ask me questions with somebody in the room?

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. What do you mean not ask you questions --

0188
1 A. John Carroll I think.

3 is currently a lawsuit pending?
4 A. Yeah. I am not sure.
5 Q. In your answers to interrogatories you
6 were asked if you had ever been a party to a lawsuit
7 and you responded no. Has the lawsuit --

9 was a passenger in her car, so I don't understand. I

11 Q. Yellow Pages?
12 A. Yes, I did.
13 Q. And you were looking up what? What
14 subject matter were you looking up?
15 A. Civil attorneys.
16 Q. Had you ever met Mr. Willits before you
17 employed him to undertake your representation in
18 this matter?
19 A. Wouldn't that still fall under if I have known
20 him before this?
21 Q. I don't know. So, the first time you ever
22 laid eyes on him or communicated with him is with
23 respect to this suit?
24 A. Obviously, yes.

Mr. Epstein, correct?

A. No, if you would let me finish. We left the State of Florida because we had a bad cocaine habit by that point. With all the money that I received from Mr. Epstein I could afford it. So, we had made a decision to leave the State of Florida and I had been clean for about a month and we couldn't handle it. So we decided to leave the State of Florida so we wouldn't have to worry about it anymore.
Q. So, if you left in June of '03 that means your last use of cocaine would have been in May of '03?

other while they were both incarcerated in the same institution?

A. No. Mr. [REDACTED] and Mr. Epstein, or [REDACTED] and Mr. Epstein met each other while I was still going to Mr. Epstein's house, but then again met while they were incarcerated together.

A. I did and he wouldn't tell me.

Q. Did you wonder why he wouldn't tell you what he had told Mr. Epstein's lawyers about you?

A. No, and I could really care less because he didn't go through half the traumatic things I did with Mr. Epstein.

Q. Well, what traumatic things did you go through?

A. Well, being that I was an underage girl with an old man masturbating in front of me and bribing me with hundreds and hundreds of dollars --

Q. And how did that, how did that result in any injury to you?

A. Well, my mental stability is nothing like it used to be before I met Mr. Epstein.

Q. What do you mean by mental stability?

A. I'm scared to go places by myself. I have trust issues with people now. I don't like when older guys stare at me.

Q. Well, after you worked -- anything else?

A. Oh, no, you can go ahead.

Q. No, I want to get all your injuries that you claim you have suffered as a result of going to

Mr. Epstein's. Anything else?

A. You may continue.

Q. Is there anything else or have you now told me everything and I will go back and ask you about it?

A. You can continue asking me questions.

Q. Is there any other way you suffered any damage as a result of going to Mr. Epstein other than your mental stability is not the same, you're scared to go places by yourself, that older guys, you don't like it when older guys stare at you.

A. I have trust issues.

Q. Trust issues. Anything else?

file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Production/Desktop/... -%20Vol.%20II.txt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM]

EFTA00023588

A. I don't know right now.

Q. Do you know of any way you suffered any damage?

A. What?

MR. SCAROLA: Well, you have already heard repeatedly --

MR. LUTTIER: No speaking -- Other than what you have told me in this deposition.

MR. SCAROLA: That's fine.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. Okay. Is that it?

A. Yeah, that's it.

Q. Okay. Now, what do you mean when you say you have trust issues.

A. Exactly what I said.

Q. Well, I don't understand that. Explain that. Explain that to me. What do you mean you have trust issues?

A. I have trust issues with people.

Q. Meaning what, you can't trust people?

A. No, I can't.

Q. Anybody?

A. Guys particularly.

Q. Males?

A. Males, older males.

Q. Any males, older males?

A. Yes.

Q. What age male does it have to be for you not to be able trust them?

A. Older than myself.

Q. So, any man that is older than you, you don't feel like you can trust him?

A. No.

Q. How has that impacted you in your daily life?

A. Well, I go outside and there is men everywhere.

Q. Okay. So, what effect does that have on you? You can't trust the people --

A. Exactly --

Q. -- according to you?

A. -- it. I can't trust nobody.

Q. So, you're not asking them to do anything or do anything for you, are you?

A. No, because I don't want them to.

Q. Okay. So, help me understand how has this impacted you at all that you claim you can't trust men that are older than you?

A. Because I can't trust them. What else do you want me to say?

Q. Well, I want you to describe how --

A. I can't --

file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Production/Desktop/... -%20Vol.%20II.txt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM]

EFTA00023589

Q. How your damage -- what is it that you want these men to do --

A. Nothing, I don't want them to do anything.
Q. -- that -- wait a minute.
A. I want them all to leave me alone.
Q. What is it that you want these men to do that you can't trust them to do?
A. There is nothing that I don't want, that I want them to do.
Q. Have you ever asked a man older than you to do something?
A. Other than my attorneys, no.
Q. All right.
A. No offense to you guys.
Q. So, there has never been an occasion since you last went to Mr. Epstein where you asked a man that was older than you to do something and you counted on trusting them?
A. I counted -- well, my attorneys, but that's it.
Q. Okay. But there has never been a time that you've placed your trust --
A. I refuse --
Q. Wait a minute.
A. No, I don't let them, allow them.
Q. Now, so, you haven't even attempted to, quote, to use your words, trust a man that's older than you since you last saw Mr. Epstein; is that correct?
A. Yes. That's correct.
Q. Now, when you say trust, do you mean you don't want to be in their physical presence?
A. I don't, no, I don't want to be in their physical presence.
Q. But in fact as you testified earlier, you worked for at least two escort services where you have gone out and been paid to be in the presence of men older than you, correct?
A. Correct.
Q. Didn't feel like you were in any kind of danger, right?
A. No, sometimes I did. And I already told you those times.
Q. Well, you wouldn't have gone if you thought you were in any danger, would you?
A. Exactly.
Q. Okay. So there were many occasions that the driver came and got you, and you were going out with somebody at the escort services where they were older than you and you had no fear of anything; isn't that right?
A. Yes.

file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/Production/Desktop/... -%20Vol.%20II.txt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM]

EFTA00023590

Q. By the way, when you worked for these escort services, would they call you up and tell you on such-and-such a day there is somebody that wants to go out with you? Is that how it was done?

A. Yes.

Q. What would they tell you about the person that wanted to go out with you, if anything?

A. They would tell me where, what the occasion was, what I would be doing, what kind of wear I would have to wear, formal, outside, the type of dress I needed to wear.

Q. Did they -- well, what specifically did they tell you about what you had to wear? Did they tell you, describe what kind of clothes or just--

A. I just said formal.

Q. But did they say, for example, wear something that's low cut or don't wear a bra or, you know, wear this or wear that?

A. No.

Q. Or this is just a formal or this is a semi-formal occasion?

A. It's a formal or semi-formal for the fourth time now I am telling you. So I am done answering questions about that.

Q. What else did they tell you other than what to wear?

A. Nothing.

Q. Did they tell you anything at all about the person with whom you would be going out?

A. Sometimes.

Q. And with what degree of frequency would they tell you about the person that you were going out with? Did they always do that?

A. Sometimes. I just said sometimes.

Q. More than half the time?

A. Sometimes. If it was --

Q. More than half --

A. -- more than half the time, I would have said more than half the time, but it's sometimes.

Q. So that was --

A. Sometimes yes and sometimes no, sometimes.

Q. Would you estimate that it was less than half the time?

A. I'm not answering that question seriously because I have said sometimes.

Q. Describe sometimes to me by percentage.

A. I don't know the percentage of sometimes. Sometimes.

Q. Well, let's -- we all know what 50 percent is, right?

A. So 50 percent. There you go. There is your sometimes.

file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Production/Desktop/... -%20Vol.%20II.txt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM]

EFTA00023591

Q. Don't let me put words in your mouth, ma'am. You were there, not me.

A. I said sometimes.

Q. If you could just tell me if it was more or less than 50 percent of the time?

MR. SCAROLA: And you have been told repeatedly that she is unable to do that for you.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. So, how can you quantify for me by definition your phrase sometimes?

MR. SCAROLA: And the answer to that question is she's been unable to. So we're sorry that we can't give you more specific information. But "sometimes" obviously means more than once and less than always.

THE WITNESS: So you figure it out.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. Well, now, ma'am, it would be hard for me to do that. I wasn't there. So, it could have been as much, according to your definition, as 99 percent of the time, right?

MR. SCAROLA: At this point those questions are annoying, embarrassing, and harassing, and I will instruct the witness not to answer.

BY MR. LUTTIER:

Q. What else, if anything, were you told about the individuals that you were going to be going out with when you were working for the escort services?

A. What does this have to do with the original question at hand?

Q. If you can just answer my question now.

A. And I already told you what they would tell me.

Q. Were you told anything else?

A. No.

Q. Were you told the person's name?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Were you told the person's name each time?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. So there's a piece of information that you got every time. Were you told the person's age?

A. No.

Q. Ever?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell the people at the escort service that you only wanted to go out with people of a certain age bracket?

EFTA00023593

A. No.

Q. You had to -- it was like a come and take all? You had to go out with whoever they said?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have the right to say no to somebody?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever, did they ever call you and say they had someone for you to go out with and you said, no, I don't want to go out with them?

A. No.

Q. So everybody that was ever, I will say offered to you, you accepted?

A. Yes.

Q. What's your best estimate about how many escorts you had between these two escort services?

A. I don't know.

Q. More than 50?

A. No.

Q. More than 25?

A. No. About 25 people.

Q. Were you told the person's race?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you give the escort service any criteria about the type of person you would agree to go out with?

A. Yes.

Q. What criteria did you give them?

A. I wouldn't go out with black guys because black people are abusive and controlling. And I have, I just felt unsafe. And I would only go out with people that didn't want sex or anything sexual.

Q. So you said no black guys and you said no one that wants anything, sex or anything that's sexual?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have to describe for the escort service --

A. No, I didn't.

Q. -- what you meant by sexual?

A. Anybody in their right mind what know what sexual and sexual things are.

Q. So, you didn't give them any age bracket, right?

A. No.

Q. You didn't give them a weight bracket, correct?

A. No.

Q. And on how many occasions did you have men that you went out with that were older than you?

A. Every time.

Q. Did you ever have to seek any kind of

EFTA00023595

A. -- for his financial stability.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand what I meant by the word relinquished. Did you ever give up or sign away your parental rights to your son, [redacted]?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Would you explain the facts and circumstances surrounding you doing that?

A. I was not financially stable enough to take care of him.

Q. And how about [redacted], your boyfriend, the father of your son?

A. He doesn't have rights to him either.

Q. And was there a legal proceeding brought to get that accomplished?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. And who brought that legal proceeding?

A. What do you mean who brought that?

A. No.

Q. And was that action brought here in Palm Beach County?

A. Yes.

Q. And isn't it true that you, that DCF told you you had no choice but to either voluntarily sign over your rights, or they were going to take your son?

A. No.

Q. What did they tell you about what your choices were?

A. They told me I had to go through classes and all kinds of things. But I still, whether I did the class or not, I wouldn't have been financially stable enough to take care of my son. So, I signed my rights over to his aunt who was financially able to take care of my child.

Q. And you, in fact, had gone to court and gotten a child support award from [redacted], had you not?

A. A child support order?

Q. An award of child support from, from [redacted]. You filed a judicial action and made a complaint against him said you wanted child support?

Q. And did DCF bring an action to take away your parental rights in that case?

A. They tried.

Q. And as a result of that did you voluntarily relinquish your rights?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And again did DCF insist that in order for you to see your child, you would have to do certain things?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you decide that what you would do is sign over parental rights rather than do those things?

A. No, I, I did some of the things that I was supposed to do.

Q. Do you know what a performance agreement is?

A. No.

Q. Did you do all the things that DCF said you had to do?

A. Everything except for domestic violence class.

Q. And did DCF say that as a result of you not doing everything, they were going to take your child away?

A. They said they were going to terminate my rights, so I signed my parental rights over to [redacted].

Q. So, in both the situation involving your son and your daughter, DCF had told you --

A. Yes.

A. He went with his family when we first started dating like, well, towards the first year we were dating.

A. Right.

A. No. He went there on vacation.
Q. Okay. So how long was he gone for this vacation?

A. Yes.
Q. And, and the, the relationship you testified about earlier with . Now, during this period of time with between '01 and '05, tell me about what the facts and circumstances were surrounding him holding a gun to your head?
A. He cheated on me with , and I suppose he felt guilty about it. So, he tried to say I was cheating on him and I wasn't cheating on him. He was cheating on me and felt guilty, and then decided he was
going to try to kill me.
Q. And you were afraid -- where were you when this gun was held to your head?
A. In the middle of a field.
Q. Where?
A. In West Palm Beach.
Q. And you were fearful at that time that he might shoot you?
A. Obviously.
Q. Well, can -- would you agree that it was a traumatic event to you to have somebody hold a gun to your head?
A. Wouldn't it be for you?
Q. I would assume so.
A. Yeah.

Q. Have you told others that you cannot answer the question about whether you're affiliated with a gang because if you did, it would risk personal harm to you?
A. No. I said I can't speak for anybody else if

they're in a gang because I don't know about it. And if they were in a gang, it's none of my business to let anybody else know about it. I can't tell somebody something about somebody else if I don't know if it's true or not.

Q. Have you ever participated in any gang membership ritual?

A. No.

Q. For approximately how long did the event take place that [redacted] held a gun to your head?

A. Like five minutes and then we kissed and made up and had sex.

Q. In the field?

A. Yep.

Q. Isn't it a fact that you told [redacted] that he held a gun on your head for a good hour?

A. No. We were arguing for an hour. He didn't hold the gun to my head for an hour. That doctor is on some other shit.

Q. And you genuinely feared that you were going to die on that occasion, did you not?

A. Well, somebody holds a gun to your head, I am pretty sure that anybody would feel that they are going to die.

Q. Was there another occasion that [redacted] was physically violent towards you?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that?

A. When he tried to drown me in a canal.

Q. When was that?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Was it before you went to Georgia or after?

A. Before.

Q. Was it while you were going to Mr. Epstein's?

A. Yep.

Q. Did you tell Mr. Epstein about it?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And when did you tell Mr. Epstein about it?

A. On one of the occasions I went to his house.

Q. And what did he say?

A. I don't know. He talked to me about it.

Q. Was he sympathetic toward you?

A. A little bit.

Q. Did you tell you you ought to get away from this guy?

A. Yeah.

Q. Did you pay attention to what he said?

A. Obviously not, if I had a kid with him some years later.

Q. So, he was dunking you in and out of water?

A. Yeah.

Q. So, you didn't ever have to fight to get up and get your head out of water?

A. While I was trying to fight to get my head out of the water, the whole time he was trying to drown me.

Q. Were you fighting with him at the time?

A. We were in an argument.

Q. Was it a traumatic event to you?

A. I heard you. You asked me if I ever used a needle that's been used before and I said no.
Q. And what you said was, not one that had been used by somebody else. So, which leaves open the possibility, have you ever used a needle that had been used before, even if it was used on you?
A. Even if it was used on me?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, then the answer would be yes, because I had always, I had always used my own needle.

A. Yeah.

Q. And when you say the prescription expired, what do you mean?

EFTA00023612

Q. Okay. You're refusing to answer that question?

A. Yes, yes, I am.

Q. Who provided the acid?

A. That's irrelevant and I refuse to answer that one too.

Q. Was this after you got back from Georgia?

A. Yeah.

Q. So, there came a point in time after you had been drug free --

A. Yes.

Q. -- from Georgia that you decided to take it up again, right?

A. Yep.

Q. When was the first time you started doing drugs again after you had been drug free until

January of '05?

A. When I was 18. When I was 18.

Q. Do you remember the event?

A. Do I remember the event that I did the drug?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yeah.

Q. And was it, was it on your birthday?

A. No.

Q. All right. Was it in January of '05?

A. No.

Q. When was it?

A. I was 18 but I don't remember the direct month.

Q. Okay.

A. I know it was not by my birthday.

Q. Okay. And can you describe the event?

A. Some other people were doing it, so I did it.

Q. What drug?

A. Crack.

Q. And where were you?

A. In a house.

Q. First time you had done it?

A. Yeah.

Q. And who was with you?

A. People. Not giving you their names because

it's irrelevant.

Q. And what house?

A. One that somebody lived in.

Q. And who supplied the crack?

A. I don't know.

Q. And after having been drug free from May of '03 to January '05, why did you decide to do crack?

A. I was going through a lot of things in my brain. I had lost my boyfriend due to Mr. Epstein. I lost my kid due to his stupid father. So, I was going

file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Production/Desktop/... -%20Vol.%20II.txt[12/11/2009 6:15:58 PM]

EFTA00023613

through a lot. Why does anybody take up using drugs or --

Q. What boyfriend are you referring to, saying you lost your boyfriend?

A. [Redacted]

Q. Now, why do you say you lost [Redacted] because of Mr. Epstein?

A. Because he found out finally we got into an argument and I just told him everything that had happened and --

Q. And when did you do that?

A. After I had my son.

Q. While you were in Georgia?

A. No, while we were in Florida. I had my son in Florida.

Q. And that's the first time you told [Redacted] everything?

A. Yeah.

Q. And what was his reaction?

A. Obviously it wasn't good if I am not with him.

Q. Well, did he, on that particular occasion leave and say he didn't want anything to do with you?

A. No. We argued for a while. We tried to make it work and it just wouldn't work.

Q. Okay. Other than the fact that you and [Redacted] had broken up and you had lost your kid, and the kid that you're talking about there, is that [Redacted]?

A. [Redacted].

Q. Anything else that caused you to use crack in January of '05?

A. I was depressed about my whole life. And I felt disgusted by Mr. Epstein.

Q. Well, actually the sexual encounters that you had with others were far more extensive than anything --

A. What are you talking about--

Q. -- anything you had ever done with Mr. Epstein, right?

A. -- sexual encounters?

Q. I mean you, you had done, you had engaged in sex with others, you engaged in sex with both sexes. You had done all sorts of things that Mr. Epstein never did with you, hadn't you?

A. So, what does that have to do with Mr. Epstein, my sex life.

Q. When you talk about being disgusted --

A. Why don't you get naked in front of an old man and play with his nipples while he masturbates. You do that and then you tell me if you feel good.

Q. And as you mentioned earlier, you did that

to get money?

A. What do you mean go back and start using it?

A. No.
Q. Had you ever been present when your mothers was arrested for using crack cocaine?
A. No.
Q. Did you tell anybody your mother used crack cocaine ever?
