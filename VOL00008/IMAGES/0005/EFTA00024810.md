Subject: Epstein Guards/ OIG Report

Date: Fri, 21 May 2021 17:45:41 +0000

Hi

We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the OIG lawyer who is responsible for preparing the report on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with , who was previously handling the investigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by close of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night who have been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOJ-OIG, and we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we expect would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless DOJ-OIG is comfortable with it.

I'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient.

Thanks very much,
