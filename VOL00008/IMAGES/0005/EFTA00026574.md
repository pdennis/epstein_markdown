Thanks again for making time to talk the other day. Below are clients for whom we'd like to schedule interviews with your office. (The initials next to their names are just for my purposes to remember who I need to add from my office for these calls/meetings.) I'd also like to hop on the phone when you have a free 10 minutes to briefly discuss a few other clients who we haven't listed below. Please just let me know if you have a moment tomorrow sometime.

Thanks,

Mariann
