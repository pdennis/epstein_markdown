FYI. I did 5 hours on Saturday, another 3 yesterday, and have been here since 9. I have successfully exported stuff from 41 items. I have another 8 left. They are all Macs and have been problematic. I will beat on it again tomorrow. I was able to do the exports with 5 machines. I will be down to 2 for the remaining Mac stuff. Will keep you posted as to how stuff goes.
