Subject: June 25 Production in Epstein FOIA

Date: Sun, 13 Jun 2021 23:31:10 +0000

Hi

Just checking in—BOP currently has a deadline of June 25 to produce documents without any redactions based on Noel in the Epstein FOIA. Is everything on track in Noel for that date to still work? As in, all interviews or any other processes that could support 7(A) withholdings will be wrapped up by June 25, right?

Thanks,
