I can try, but I suspect it’s just too late.

Is there a cell number for ___________ that I can call to make travel arrangements for ___________? I sent ___________ the email below and left a voice mail for her on her office phone but she did not respond. I understand.
It is the weekend, but is there a way that I can reach her or another agent to arrange ___________ trip from Las Vegas to New York on Monday morning? It would mean so much to her to attend the hearing and ___________ does not have funds to pay for the flight and get reimbursed after that.
