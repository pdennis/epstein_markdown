Sure! They are available tomorrow at 1 and Friday at 3. Monday is MLK Day and I am not sure how that will affect their schedules right now. They could definitely do next Tuesday at 3:30 also.

Hey __________ – Would you be able to help us find a time to chat with __________ and the Brass about __________? Just chiefs and Brass, no team. I think we have pretty decent availability tomorrow and Friday if either works for __________. But not urgent, so next week is fine, too, if that’s better.

Thanks,

Chief, Public Corruption Unit
