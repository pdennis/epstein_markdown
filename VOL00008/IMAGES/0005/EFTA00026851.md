IN RE APPLICATION OF THE

28 U.S.C. § 1651

20 MAG 01560

Filed Under Seal

# ORDER

This matter having come before the Court pursuant to an application under Title 20, United States Code, Section 1232g(b)(1)(J)(i), and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1651 which application requests the issuance of an order directing Interlochen Center for the Arts (“Interlochen”) and its employees, located at 4000 Highway M-137 Interlochen, MI 49643, and Interlochen employees, not to notify any other person of the existence of the attached subpoena seeking records, the Court finds that the applicant has offered reasonable grounds to believe that such disclosure will result in the intimidation of potential witnesses, or the destruction of or tampering with evidence, and will seriously jeopardize the investigation.

IT APPEARING that the information sought in the attached subpoena is directed at establishing the illegal activity under investigation and identifying the individuals responsible for such activity, there is reason to believe that disclosure of the scope and direction of the inquiry will result in the intimidation of potential witnesses, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and will seriously jeopardize the investigation.

IT IS ORDERED that pursuant to Title 20, United States Code, Section 1232g(b)(1)(J)(i), and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1651, Interlochen and its employees shall not disclose the existence of the attached subpoena to any other person (except as necessary to carry out the subpoena) for a period of 180 days from the date of this Order.

EFTA00026851

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order and the Application upon which it was granted are to be filed under seal until otherwise ordered by the Court, except that the Government may without further order provide copies of the Application and Order as need be to personnel assisting the Government in the investigation and prosecution of this matter, and disclose these materials as necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure obligations in any prosecutions related to this matter.
