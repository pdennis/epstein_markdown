☐ No. You don't owe a penalty. Don't file Form 2210 unless box E below applies.
☑ Yes. You may owe a penalty, but don't file Form 2210 unless one or more boxes in Part II below applies.
- If box B, C, or D applies, you must figure your penalty and file Form 2210.
- If box A or E applies (but not B, C, or D) file only page 1 of Form 2210. You aren't required to figure your penalty; the IRS will figure it and send you a bill for any unpaid amount. If you want to figure your penalty, you may use Part III or IV as a worksheet and enter your penalty on your tax return, but file only page 1 of Form 2210.

# Part II Reasons for Filing. Check applicable boxes. If none apply, don't file Form 2210.

A ☐ You request a waiver (see instructions) of your entire penalty. You must check this box and file page 1 of Form 2210, but you aren't required to figure your penalty.

E ☐ You filed or are filing a joint return for either 2016 or 2017, but not for both years, and line 8 above is smaller than line 5 above. You must file page 1 of Form 2210, but you aren't required to figure your penalty (unless box B, C, or D applies).

To the best of my knowledge and belief this information is true, correct and complete.

I authorize DOR to inform my Electronic Return Originator and/or the transmitter when my electronic return has been accepted. In the event that it is rejected, I authorize DOR to identify the reasons for rejection so that the return can be corrected and re-transmitted. If I have filed a balance due return, I understand that if DOR does not receive full and timely payment of my tax liability, I will remain liable for the tax liability and all applicable penalties and interest.

(Collectors are not responsible for reviewing the taxpayer's return; however, they must ensure that the M-8453 accurately reflects the data on the return.) I have obtained the taxpayer's signature before submitting this return to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. I have provided the taxpayer with a copy of all forms and information filed with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. If I am also the paid preparer, under pains and penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined the above taxpayer's return and accompanying schedules and statements and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct and complete. I declare that I have verified the taxpayer's proof of account and it agrees with the name(s) shown on this form. This declaration of paid preparer (other than taxpayer) is based on all information of which the preparer has any knowledge. Original Forms M-8453 should not be sent to DOR, but must instead be retained by the ERO on the ERO's business premises for a period of three years from the date the return to which the M-8453 relates was filed.

Affordability as Determined By State Guidelines

Note: This section will require the use of worksheets and tables found in the instructions. You must complete the worksheet(s) to determine if health insurance was affordable to you during the 2017 tax year.

10. Did your employer offer affordable health insurance that met minimum creditable coverage requirements as determined by completing the Schedule HC Worksheet for Line 10 in the instructions?
10 You Yes No
Spouse Yes No

Fill in No if your employer did not offer health insurance that met minimum creditable coverage requirements, you were not eligible for health insurance offered by your employer, you were self-employed or you were unemployed.

11. Were you eligible for government-subsidized health insurance as determined by completing the Schedule HC Worksheet for Line 11 in the instructions?
11 You Yes No
Spouse Yes No

If you answer No, go to line 12. If you answer Yes, go to the Health Care Penalty Worksheet in the instructions to calculate your penalty amount.

12. Were you able to purchase affordable private health insurance that met minimum creditable coverage requirements as determined by completing the Schedule HC Worksheet for Line 12 in the instructions?
12 You Yes No
Spouse Yes No

If you answer No, you are not subject to a penalty. Continue completing your tax return. If you answer Yes, go to the Health Care Penalty Worksheet in the instructions to calculate your penalty amount.

Complete Only If You Are Filing An Appeal

You must complete the Health Care Penalty Worksheet to determine your penalty amount before completing this section.

You may have grounds to appeal if you were unable to obtain affordable insurance that meets the minimum creditable coverage requirements in 2017 due to a hardship or other circumstances. The grounds for appeal are explained in more detail in the instructions. If you believe you have grounds for appealing the penalty, fill in the field(s) below. The appeal will be heard by the Massachusetts Health Connector. By filling in the field below, you (or your spouse if married filing jointly) are authorizing DOR to share information from your tax return, including this schedule, with the Massachusetts Health Connector for purposes of deciding your appeal.

You will receive a follow-up letter asking you to state your grounds for appeal in writing, and submit supporting documentation. Failure to respond to that letter within the time specified in the letter will lead to dismissal of your appeal and will result in a future assessment of a penalty. Once your documentation is received, it will be reviewed by the Massachusetts Health Connector and you may be required to attend a hearing on your case. You will be required to file your claims under the pains and penalties of perjury.

Note: If you are filing an appeal, make sure you have calculated the penalty amount that you are appealing, but do not assess yourself or enter a penalty amount on your Form 1 or Form 1-NR/PY. Also, do not include any hardship documentation with your original return. You will be required to submit substantiating hardship documentation at a later date during the appeal process.

You I wish to appeal the penalty. I authorize DOR to share this tax return including this schedule with the Massachusetts Health Connector for purposes of deciding this appeal.

Spouse I wish to appeal the penalty. I authorize DOR to share this tax return including this schedule with the Massachusetts Health Connector for purposes of deciding this appeal.
