Good evening,

We will formally call this in tomorrow morning, but we wanted to advise you that we expect that defendant Jeffrey Epstein will be presented tomorrow in United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490. We expect the indictment to be unsealed first thing tomorrow morning, and we’ll get you a copy immediately when that occurs. Mr. Epstein is represented by retained counsel, including Martin Weinberg and Reid Weingarten.

We are available anytime tomorrow to provide any useful information in connection with your report, either at the email addresses here or via phone at the following numbers:
