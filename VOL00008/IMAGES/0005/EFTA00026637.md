Hello,

I'm checking to see if we are still on for a call today. I am available, at my office, I don't think we firmed up who is making the call.

Thanks for speaking with me this afternoon. I've copied my colleagues, [ ] and [ ]. so that you have everyone's contact information.

In terms of scheduling a call tomorrow, we are going to be tied up in the morning, and the afternoon is a bit uncertain given that we are not sure yet of the timing of the presentment for Mr. Epstein. I think it would make sense to plan for a call at 4, and we can let you know if we need to reschedule, if that's alright with you.

Attached is the subpoena for Ms. Maxwell. The indictment is currently under seal, but we anticipate that it will be unsealed tomorrow morning and publicly available. Please let us know tomorrow if you have any difficulty and we can certainly send you a copy.

Thanks very much, and looking forward to discussing further tomorrow.

Dear _________________,

It was a pleasure talking to you today. As we discussed, I am authorized to accept service of the subpoena for testimony issued to Ms. Maxwell by the Grand Jury, SDNY. I expect that we will need to coordinate a mutually convenient time to either appear or proffer, either in advance or in lieu of any testimony.

I will be in court tomorrow morning and afternoon, so I have a small window to discuss the matter—probably between 11am and noon and then again at around 4pm my time which is 2 hrs. earlier than the East Coast. My staff will attempt to obtain a copy of the Epstein indictment as soon as it is publicly available. In my experience this can sometimes be difficult so if it is not an inconvenience perhaps you could email the indictment along with the subpoena and waiver.

Best Regards,
