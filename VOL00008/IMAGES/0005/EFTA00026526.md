Dear Judge Nathan,

The Government respectfully submits the attached memorandum in support of detention in the above-captioned case. We will file the motion on ECF as soon as the docket becomes active. I have copied defense counsel here, and will also submit a copy of this memorandum to the presiding Magistrate Judge in the District of New Hampshire in connection with this afternoon's proceedings.

Sincerely,
