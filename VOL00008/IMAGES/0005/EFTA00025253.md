Unfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 – see the invoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I’m supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily allowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax.

Please let me know when it is corrected and I will review it again.
