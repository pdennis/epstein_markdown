Hi ,

Thank you. Let me circle up with a few folks, including BOP, about how best to proceed here, and I will get back to you.

Thanks,

Hi ,

We requested these from the BOP, and they provided a set of documents, which we then produced to defense counsel. We did not do a page by page comparison between the redacted set and the unredacted set, so we can't guarantee that they are "comprehensive." But we can provide you with what we have, assuming that there aren't any issues with us sharing in that way.

Best,

and

I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green marking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the docs, but it looks like not all. Do you have a comprehensive set somewhere?

Thanks,
