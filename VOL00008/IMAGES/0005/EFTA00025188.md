John,

Wanted to get back to you regarding your letter of March 9, 2020, which we received via the Eastern District U.S. Attorney's Office, and your follow-up call this week, both of which we appreciate. We did receive the letter, and in the first instance it would be helpful to know the name and contact info of the person who's the source of this information (assuming it is someone other than you) – we ordinarily pass this kind of information to the FBI for initial response, but it's not clear from the letter whom they would be in touch with to follow up. It would also be helpful to know, if you're aware, whether there is any allegation that the relevant interns were underage.

thanks very much,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
