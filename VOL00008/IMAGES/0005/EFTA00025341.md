Perfect, thank you! , if we could please get a list of what CART received, and what's been processed and sent back, I think that will get us started - and happy to talk via phone if that's easier. Thanks again.

Hey

I've copied here who has handled all of the Epstein evidence that was sent to CART. He should be able to answer your questions regarding what he's processed.

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 38 computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.
