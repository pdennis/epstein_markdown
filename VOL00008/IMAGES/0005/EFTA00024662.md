Thanks.

For planning purposes, we anticipate would like to see our letter regarding the trial date on Monday before it's due, so if you could get us a draft tomorrow evening or Monday morning that would be helpful. Thanks very much.

The defendant's supplemental pretrial motions (regarding the superseder) were filed yesterday, and I'm attaching the brief here. The team is reviewing this weekend and will reach out early next week about our game plan for responding. Our opposition is due on May 21st.
