The hard drives were delivered just after 1pm. Please confirm receipt.

Also, we have asked for a prison visit from 8am-3pm on Friday for the review of the secure laptop. I will let you know when we receive confirmation. Please have the agents plan for Friday.

Thanks,

We expect to have another discovery production ready to load tomorrow, October 19, 2020. Would you please provide us with two more drives (one for you and one for your client) onto which we can load the production?
