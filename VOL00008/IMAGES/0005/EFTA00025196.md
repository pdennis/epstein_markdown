Thanks—I think it would help to even more expressly note that the document is not comprehensive (for example, this spreadsheet doesn't list the yearbooks, so it sounds like it's missing more recent evidence). Proposed addition below.

To my knowledge, that is the only excel spreadsheet in our possession that indexes physical evidence related to this case, but this is not a comprehensive document. The discovery productions also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands, but they are not contained in a spreadsheet.

As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to complete such an index.

Best,

Thank you. Is that the only index of physical evidence available?

Counsel,

In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Best,
