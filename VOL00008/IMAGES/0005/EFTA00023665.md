Hey [Redacted] – we keep getting a weird vm for him, do you have an email address by any chance? Thanks!

Plaintiff’s Attorney [Redacted] (who represents several Epstein victims) asked me to reach out to you when I spoke with him yesterday. Apparently he represents a victim (I think named Mrs. [Redacted]) of a CFU defendant of yours, and he’s been trying to get in touch with you. He’s been very helpful in arranging victim interviews for us, so I agreed to reach out. Mind if I send an email putting the two of you in touch?

Thanks!
