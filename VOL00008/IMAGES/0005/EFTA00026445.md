Following up on our Brass meeting just now, It's that time of year when we need to do forfeiture funding requests. These are basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant investigative costs (e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a super quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today – sorry for the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be).

Also, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC – please send it back to me.

Thanks,
