Attached for your review is a draft Priorities webpage. There are further edits to be made – some formatting (for instance, putting dates in the right order or making sure that fonts and indentations are correct), some stylistic (e.g., the Combatting Corruption entries each begin with language akin to a headline while the others do not), and some more substantive (do we want to add or delete particular cases?). Also, the visuals that go with each subpage have not been completed. In some instances, that’s because Nick has not located visuals that he thinks are usable or a good fit. In other places, he has identified visuals that he plans to add, but has yet to do so. That said, many of the subpages do have visuals. In order to view the visuals for any subpage, you hit the “Ctrl” key while clicking on the heading for the subpage – e.g., for Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror, you press on the “Ctrl” key and click on the heading Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror. I’ve also attached a link (below), which is easier to open for that subpage so that you can see how the subpages will look. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks.
