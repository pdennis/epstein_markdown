Hi _________________________

Attached please find a draft search warrant for the NY residence. I have _________________________ as the affiant, but let me know if I should switch that to _________________________ or someone else. Also, please give me a call if you have any revisions or would like to discuss. Plan is to swear this out on the same day as the arrest.

Thanks,
