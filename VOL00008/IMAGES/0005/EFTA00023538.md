As a follow up to our conversation, I have attached a copy of my subpoena tracker. The tracker only includes subpoenas that were served by the FBI. As an example, the Epstein Deutsche Bank production is not included in this list.

If you are missing any productions, please have [redacted] contact me and I will provide it to him.

You mentioned that is it is possible to set up a DOJ virtual drive that we can share. That sounds great.
