Glen,

We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. . The topics we expect to cover include:

- The identities of any CBP employees Mr. recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands.
- Any steps Mr. recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid processing that travelers would normally undergo.
- Any favors Mr. recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly.

We expect to ask Mr. about his interactions with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. met and interacted with the nature of those interactions, and any interactions may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. knowledge).

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York

Sorry for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on Thursday, 11/12. Let us know if anything in that range will work.

So as to make sure Mr. [redacted]s prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover?

Thanks,
Glen

Glen,

EFTA00024935

As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. [REDACTED] via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. [REDACTED] would be available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours at most.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York

Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, Danielle and Mr. [redacted], but also Josh Morrissey who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go for our meeting.

Thanks,
