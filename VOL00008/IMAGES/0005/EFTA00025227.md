Thank you. The only way I could get the Epstein victim calls to you and the team was to have Outlook search for a certain string in the subject that included my telephone. This was someone responding to a voice message I left earlier. The subject of the email he received included my number.

☐ I think I might be getting your emails accidentally forwarded (along with the Epstein team). This happened a few weeks ago as well. No worries, but I wanted to let you know.
