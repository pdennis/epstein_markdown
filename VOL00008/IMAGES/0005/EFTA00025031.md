Hi team,

Attached are (1) the various responses on the things we're not doing, (2) a response on the three exhibits motion, and (3) a response on the motion to suppress MV-4's ID. I've copied [redacted], who I think should look at (2) and (3). [redacted], whenever you're getting ready to look at them, maybe send us all an email so you can get the latest version?

This leaves two motions, precluding reference to "victims" and precluding reference to "rape," which I'll get you tonight.

Thanks!
