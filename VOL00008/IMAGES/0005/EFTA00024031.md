That should work, thanks. Mind sending me the names and email addresses of participants, please?

&gt; Hi Mariann,
&gt;
&gt; Hope you're well too, thanks. April 1 is pretty full on my end now. Would April 2 work for an interview with this survivor, please?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; ,

&gt; I hope you're well. We have another survivor who would like to share her information/what happened to her. If you're willing/open, perhaps we could just add her to April 1st, or let us know what you prefer. She is someone who was abused by Epstein on one occasion in 2004.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; Mariann
