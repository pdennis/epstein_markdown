Subject: Telephone calls about Jeffrey Epstein

We need to get this info to all the SSOs who might answer the phone when [REDACTED] is gone for the day.

++++

If we receive a call that sounds like it is from a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, or someone who says they have information, please respond this way.

Tell the caller you are going to forward them to a special number for this where they should leave a message with a phone number where we can call them. Tell them someone will definitely call them. Then forward them to 1-1030.
