A couple questions on this list. First, are you sure that NYC024392 was provided to us? I ask because as of 7/14 (last Tuesday), in an email said we didn't have that drive yet – see the spreadsheet in the attached email – and I also referred to that number on Wednesday in our call as one we didn't have and CART didn't say anything different.

The other question is, do you have any info on NYC024328 in terms of device, serial number, etc? I ask because looking at the same chart that sent in the attached email last Tuesday, there doesn't appear to be *any* device with that identifier. The list goes 326, 327, 329.

thanks,
