Chris,

As I mentioned on our call, our office is processing those non-nude images for production, and we will let you know when they are ready to be loaded onto drives for you and your client. As is the case with any items that were seized during the FBI's searches of Epstein's residences in New York and the Virgin Islands, and as noted in my letter dated August 21, 2020, if you wish to review those photographs—or any other items from those searches—yourself before that production is ready, we can schedule a time for you to go to the FBI offices and review them.

To the extent you are reiterating your request from yesterday afternoon that the FBI bring a laptop containing those images to the MDC for you and your client to review together, we are already working with the FBI on the logistics of loading the files and transporting them to the MDC. Due to the large number files, this will take a few days. I will let you know as soon as those logistics are sorted and the FBI is able to bring the files to the MDC for you and your client to review.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York

Following-up on our phone call yesterday afternoon, we request that you make available to Ms. Maxwell as soon as possible all of the roughly 40,000 non-nude/non-Highly Confidential images that we discussed on our call and that have not been produced on any of the hard drives. Ms. Maxwell is available to review these images as early as tomorrow. Please let us know the earliest date that these materials can be made available.

Regards,
