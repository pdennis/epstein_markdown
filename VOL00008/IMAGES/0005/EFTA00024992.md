I am on the VTC with Ms. Maxwell.

She has not received the time-sensitive legal mail referenced in my earlier email.

Please assist in getting this legal mail provided to her today.

Thank you-

Enjoy the long weekend.

Good morning-

On Thursday, 12/14, we are express mailing time-sensitive documents for next-day delivery for review by Ms. Maxwell. We need to discuss these documents with Ms. Maxwell on Tuesday 12/19, in order to comply with a court-ordered filing deadline. We understand that legal calls are suspended on holidays (Monday, 1/18, is Martin Luther King Day).

To ensure that Ms. Maxwell receives the documents on Friday for review over the weekend, we are requesting permission to send them to the attention of the Legal Department for prompt delivery to Ms. Maxwell.

Please let me know if this is acceptable.

In addition, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be given access to the laptop computer provided by the government for use over the weekend.

The MDC computers are not capable of opening discovery documents provided by the government, which is why the laptop has been provided. Without access to a computer that allows her to review discovery, Ms. Maxwell is effectively denied the ability to assist in her defense.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
