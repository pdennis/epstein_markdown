Brad, Brittany,

Attached please find a redacted version of the defense's memorandum of law in support of her Federal Rule of Evidence 412 motion and related exhibits. As we mentioned earlier, this was filed under seal by the defense. Any response is due on November 1, 2021. Likewise, any and all responses will also be filed under seal and will not be docketed. The Court also ordered that any in camera hearing is tentatively scheduled for November 5, 2021. We are happy to discuss further tomorrow.

I'm also attaching the Court's Order about the November 1 in-person pretrial conference.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
