Sure, thanks – and yes, quite the weekend. If it’s alright with you, let’s do 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday – you can reach us at [redacted], or we can also call you then if that’s easier, whatever you prefer.

thanks,

Hi [redacted],

No need to take any more time out of what I’m sure was a busy weekend for you. Let’s set a time for Tuesday morning (the earlier the better for me). Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with [redacted], if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

[redacted]

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented [redacted], prior to his passing in 2018. Agent [redacted] served [redacted] with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan's former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

[redacted]
