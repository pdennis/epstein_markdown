Team, apologies again for the delay on this (among other things – and you’ll be entertained by this – I have an extremely unexpected in-custody arrest today! on a VOSR for failure to check in with probation, with a warrant from *early February*!!), but draft is attached. It is as strong as I could think to make it, but very happy to take additional thoughts or suggestions, and I anticipate we’ll likely get some pushback but we can see what they say. Thoughts / comments / edits? Thanks.
