Hi _______________________________

I wanted to alert you to a recent development. _______________________________ was recently served with a subpoena for a deposition in _______________________________ v. _______________________________, _______________________________, _______________________________, _______________________________, ex-husband _______________________________ is being sued by a former employee on several grounds including sex discrimination, battery and IIED. _______________________________ is getting dragged in because they want to connect _______________________________ to _______________________________ actions while working for Epstein.

The depo was set for November 30. The Defendants filed a motion to quash (attached), which the court granted and stayed the depo. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to reconsider (attached), and the Court has ordered the Defendant to respond. The Plaintiffs have included a copy of the NPA, _______________________________ depo and have made numerous factual allegations related to Epstein in their motion.

I’ll keep you updated as I learn more.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving,

Joe
