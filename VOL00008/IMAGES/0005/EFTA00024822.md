Subject: calls re: Epstein

Hi _______________________________

It seems like a fair number of Epstein related calls are coming in through the main SDNY line, and we’ve set up a particular line internally for those to be forwarded to. Would it be possible to let the CSOs to know that they should transfer any incoming calls to the following extension, where they can leave a message? It’s been set up so that those messages will auto-forward to our whole team. The number is 212-637-1030.

Thanks!
