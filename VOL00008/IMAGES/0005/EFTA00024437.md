Thank you, [REDACTED]. We will convey this information to defense counsel and ask that they follow the protocol for any calls other than the standing 10am calls.

You're welcome. We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell at the number he has previously provided. We will also provide a call on Monday 7/13/20.

The EDNY and SDNY created a joint protocol whereby counsel may request legal calls to be placed in the afternoon at the MDC. Requests should be sent to [REDACTED].

Truly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, counsel really should send the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to ensure inmates get equitable access. If they anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should make requests in advance and note whether and when calls would be preferred. Generally, calls are for 30 minutes in duration. If a longer call is desired, that should be explained as well.

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thank you,

Thank you so much,

A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's something you would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are very grateful for the time.

We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' counsel following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel thus far. There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. Would you be able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they understand what steps to take going forward?

Thank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it.

Best,

[REDACTED]

You're welcome.

Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), in advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls.

I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-day, that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel having difficulty scheduling legal calls.

Thank you,

Thanks, This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty scheduling legal calls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to address this issue. Thanks very much.

Hi

I just saw this now. Is this about the legal call issue or something separate? If it's about the legal call, I am working on it.

Thanks,

Hi

Thanks for your help with this. Are you available now for a call? We are having a time sensitive issue with this.

Thanks,

Hi

For future reference, there is a protocol in place for defense counsel to request legal calls. If counsel is unaware of it, I can provide the details.

However, I understand that she just came into custody today and there is a more urgent deadline. If you can please provide the name and phone number of counsel, I will do my best.

Thanks,

Hi

Hope you're doing well. This evening, Judge Nathan directed the parties in the US v. Ghislaine Maxwell case to file a letter by 9pm today. Defense counsel need to speak with Ms. Maxwell this evening about the letter, but they have not been able to reach her. Would it be possible to allow Ms. Maxwell to make a legal call to her lawyers this evening, please?

Thank you very much for your help.
