Man, that spelling was not included in my searches. So the answer is that I unfortunately don't currently have an independent memory of it. However, reconstructing the communications, it looks like at 4:50 p.m. connected us with [REDACTED] SSA of C-19, via email. At 5:15 p.m., sent an email to me, [REDACTED], and saying it was nice speaking with us and thanking us for offering assistance in the investigation, and copying his agents on the case ([REDACTED], and [REDACTED]). Then at 5:59 p.m., I sent an email to those agents copying you as their point person.

I don't remember whether I actually spoke with the line agents, [REDACTED], or some combination of both, but I think it's most likely that we spoke with [REDACTED], given [REDACTED] email at 4:50, [REDACTED] email to the three of us at 5:15 referring having spoken with us, and my email to [REDACTED] about the info from C-19 at 5:34. The originals of those emails are all attached. Let me know if any other info would be useful? And I'm sorry I didn't recall this when we talked on the phone earlier.

Do you have any record/memory of who from C-19 told you this?

We just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current / latest girlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from her lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It sounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new investigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate.

thanks,
