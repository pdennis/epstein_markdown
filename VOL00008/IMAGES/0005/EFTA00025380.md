Hey, so unfortunately the open-source website that tracked private planes (even those that paid to be de-listed on public trackers, such as your target jet) is currently down as of just a couple days ago:

https://adsbexchange.com/flight-data-sql-archive/

If it comes back up, may be of use, otherwise you may have to rely on international flight records.

And pros memo attached, as promised – again, don’t hesitate to be in touch if anything else would be useful, whether in the near term or further along in your investigation. Good luck!
