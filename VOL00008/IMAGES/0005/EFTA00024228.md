Good morning-

We have checked our log books and both pieces were picked up. On the 15th and 18th, respectively. Both were then delivered to Ms. Maxwell on those days.

Good evening-

I am still awaiting a reply to yesterday's email regarding Ms. Maxwell's legal mail.
There are items that need to be picked up by the MDC.
I have provided the tracking information.
Please provide a response by 10:00 am tomorrow Wednesday.
Thank you-
Bobbi

Good evening -

During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting room that I have been required

to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room.

Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim

the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner room.

I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room.

The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid.

Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below.

Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries.

Thank you-

Bobbi
