Hi Joe,

Attached is the proffer agreement for today—I'll discuss this at the beginning of our meeting, but in terms of mechanics it's fine with me if you and your client sign after the proffer, and you can just email it to me whenever that's done.

Thanks,

Perfect, I received the invite with the link. Unfortunately (or fortunately sometimes) WebEx has been a part a daily part of my life the past year, so we should be OK. See you all then, let me know if you need anything further from us in the meantime.

Good afternoon,

I spoke with [redacted], and she can make herself available the following dates:

May 3, 4 (before 2pm), 5, 6, 12, 13 or 14.

She is going to take the day off of work, so no need to do it after-hours (thank you for the offer). Let me know if you need additional availability.

Thanks,

Joe

We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we’d be able to circle back with you earlier, but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate both your client’s prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we’ve previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.
