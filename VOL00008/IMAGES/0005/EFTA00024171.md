As you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some press coverage since yesterday about the release pursuant to FOIA of some USMS records. I just spoke with the Associate General Counsel at the USMS, who wanted to provide us with the actual source materials (USM 11s (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in all circumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our investigation from the release, that we have the original materials. He also offered to serve as a POC if we have any questions.
