Got a quick response. The Marshals will need an order from the Court. You may note that my office does not object to the request.

Best,

Hi Bobbi,

I will forward your request to my contact with the USMS and note that I have no objection. And no objection to you contacting the Court.

Best,

Good evening-

Might you have any sway in persuading the Marshal permit Ms. Maxwell to have her legal materials while in the cell block?

She arrived today at ~ 5:15 am and remained idle in the cell block until ~ 8:30 am when she was brought to the fifth floor.

Otherwise, any opposition to me contacting the Court for an order (per the Marshal)?

Enjoy the evening. See you tomorrow.

Best-

Bobbi
