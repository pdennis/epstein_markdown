Hi

The Florida State Attorney, Dave Aronberg, left me the attached message. I'm assuming this relates to the Epstein case (though it's possible, given the timing of the call today, that it relates to WBTW). Since this is the State Attorney himself, I wanted to check with you before calling back to see if you'd prefer to speak with him.

Thanks,
