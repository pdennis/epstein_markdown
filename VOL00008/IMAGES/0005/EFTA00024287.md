Thanks very much, Sigrid. We'll keep holding that slot for ___________.

Happy to do a video conference with ___________. Could you please propose some dates/times that would work for you and for her to do the conference?

Just a quick update – ___________ has been working feverishly to try to secure her passport/visa so she can get here and I know that ___________ has been making efforts to help her but she doesn't have it yet. I know you are holding a slot for her interview for Tuesday but that will depend on whether she can actually travel here.

Also – ___________ has decided its best that she not travel but she is willing to do something via a video conference if that would work.

Thanks very much, Sigrid. If those times can't end up working, we can try to do some reshuffling of our own. Please let us know, and hopefully we can work out the scheduling.

is driving in for the meeting and she said she needs to be back before the evening on 10/23 but I believe her commute is about an hour so we may be able to set her for a different date to come into the city and meet with you.

Let me see what I can do about getting there earlier on 10/22 so you can meet with before 2:00 on 10/22. I may be able to have one of my partners go with her and then I could join when I arrive. Let me see what I can work out.

Best,
Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

Thanks very much for helping us coordinate these meetings.

Meeting with [redacted] from 2pm to 4pm will work for us, thank you. We'll plan to meet with her at our office (1 St. Andrews Plaza) on 10/22 at 2pm.

Unfortunately, our schedules are a bit tight from 4pm to 6pm on 10/22 and for most of the day on 10/23. Would [redacted] and/or [redacted] be available on 10/22 before 2pm, on 10/22 after 6pm, or on 10/23 after 5pm?

Thanks,

Hello [redacted] - sorry for the delay but I have been trying to get a handle on who is coming for the meeting etc.

[redacted] is a victim that I think will be helpful to your continuing investigation. She is working hard with your victims' coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US then we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22nd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will probably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the interview (from 2-4).

[redacted] is going to be attending the meeting and she said she could interview with you right after the meeting. I believe the notice says the meeting starts at 10:00 on October 23rd so maybe we plan to meet you at 12:00 depending on the length of the victims' meeting.

[redacted] also wanted to come to the meeting. I know you met with her for a short while. If you would like to meet with her for a more detailed interview we could do that on the afternoon of October 22nd from 4 - 6 if that works.

is She would like to try to attend via skype or some kind of conference line. I know you interviewed her sister . If you would like to also interview I can set something up.

Let me know if that works.

Best,

Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

Hope you're doing well. Mandy mentioned that some of your clients might be interested in being interviewed while they are in New York on 10/22 and 10/23. We'd be happy to get times on the calendar. Would you please let us know who would be available for interviews and what dates and times work for each client?

Thanks,
