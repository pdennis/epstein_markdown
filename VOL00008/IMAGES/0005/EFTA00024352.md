Hi all,

Who is his lead counsel? The Warden is preparing the formal letter for the Court, in which your office, the USMS, USPO, and lead counsel are cc'ed. Do you have an email address for him/her?

Thank you,

Supervisory Staff Attorney

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.

As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

Thank you,

FYI:

The BOP just informed us that Epstein is being taken by ambulance to the hospital from another apparent suicide attempt- no other information was provided.

They will update us as more info becomes available.
