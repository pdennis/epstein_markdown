Hello,

I'm a reporter at Insider, and I'm writing to you because I'm working on a story that discusses some aspects of the federal criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein.

I specifically wanted to ask if any member of the prosecution or a spokesperson for them would be willing to discuss the government's investigation of Epstein's potential ties to foreign governments, as evidenced by its inquiries into his expired Austrian passport and his potential citizenship in other countries. (This is in the context of a larger story about his travels to the Middle East.)

Would any of you be willing to talk to me about this aspect of the case?

My working deadline is Friday at noon, Eastern Time, but there is some flexibility if you need more time. I'm happy to hop on the phone, too, if that's more convenient.

Thanks,

Keenan
