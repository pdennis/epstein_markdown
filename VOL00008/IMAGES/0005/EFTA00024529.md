Robert – got it, thank you. So that wouldn’t have been her first trip, then, based on the flight records (and timeline), so we’ll make that note. Thanks again.

Hey ☐. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the lion king:

Broadway play... Epstein bragged about being good friends with ☐ and we had amazing first row mezzanine seats they she had apparently given him.

Robert,

Wanted to quickly follow up on our conversation from a couple weeks ago – obviously it was before the world imploded, so understand if you haven't gotten a chance to connect on this yet, but we were wondering about the Lion King question? Just to briefly remind, the Lion King musical first came out in 1997, which we think would have been well after [Redacted] first trip to New York (based on her recollection as well as the flight records), while the movie came out in 1994 and was in theaters through approximately spring 1995. So entirely possible she was referencing the movie version, or that going to the play wasn't the first visit, or just doesn't have a specific memory, etc etc, but wanted to check for our records and our decision-making process.

Thank you! And hope you and your family are healthy and safe in the midst of everything going on.

thanks again,

[Redacted]
