Why don't we start with [redacted] that window if we can grab 10 minutes. We can follow up with whole group tomorrow if necessary -- noon is middle of Cohen testimony.

Unfortunately because of interviews there aren't slots when full brass is available. [redacted] is around 1:30-3:30 if you want to bring him up to speed. The full group could meet tomorrow at noon or 5:30pm.

[redacted] asked that we set up a brass meet on Epstein — any time today? Should be 30 min.
