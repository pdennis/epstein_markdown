# Individual Retirement Accounts

The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and the IRA Disclosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement, we will notify you of the updates and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions.

According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as the custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account.

Beneficiaries must be named in writing. You may apply your written beneficiary designation to your future IRA accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation. If you do not designate beneficiaries, or your beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the assets, your beneficiary with respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed of, will be your surviving spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. If you designate a spouse as your beneficiary, the subsequent divorce or termination of the marriage will automatically revoke the designation. You can designate your former spouse as beneficiary by completing a new change of beneficiary form.

If your IRA account is funded via transfer from another financial institution, you represent that all transfers to such Account originate from: (1) an IRA in the same name and of the same type (e.g. traditional, Roth); (2) an inherited IRA in the same name and of the same type; or (3) a qualified plan account that you were entitled to rollover to an IRA.

Please refer to the Fees and Charges section of the Agreements and Disclosures booklet and the Understanding our fees, charges and other compensation brochure which is available at www.ubs.com/accountdisclosures for more information about fees and charges. If you have questions, please contact your Financial Advisor.

The features and fees of your International Resource Management Account are more fully described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

The features and fees of your IRA are fully described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

We accept any approved plan documents, known as prototypes, whether they were produced by UBS, an IRS model or a document from another provider. If you would like to use a UBS prototype, please ask for a copy of the SEP IRA Plan or SIMPLE IRA Plan prototype document from your UBS Financial Advisor.

You are aware that certain Puerto Rico Investments may not be suitable for all investors as they may be designed primarily for long-term investors.

- You are solely responsible for complying with all of the applicable rules and requirements pertaining to your residency for federal and Puerto Rico tax purposes and that neither UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico nor UBS AG or any of its affiliates are making any representation as to your compliance with any such rules and requirements or with respect to your residency for federal and Puerto Rico tax purposes, or providing any tax advice.

If available cash balances in your Account are not swept for any reason, available cash balances will not be invested, and we are not required to pay interest on available cash balances in your Account.

We may change or discontinue our sweep services at any time, including changing the terms and conditions of any sweep service and adding or discontinuing specific Sweep Options. We may establish eligibility criteria for Sweep Options offered to different clients, including, but not limited to, establishing minimum asset requirements for clients to qualify for specific Sweep Options. We may move your balances to an eligible Sweep Option in the event that you become ineligible for an existing Sweep Option.

The yields for each Sweep Option will be different and may vary. Current yields may be obtained from your Financial Advisor or from: www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/misc/accountsweepyields. Each Sweep Option is subject to different risks and account protection features.

In connection with the Sweep Funds, UBS receives: (1) service fees from certain of the Sweep Funds via payments by their principal underwriter; (2) transfer agency related delegated service fees from the transfer agent for those same Sweep Funds; and (3) revenue sharing payments for the same Sweep Funds from UBS Asset Management (Americas) Inc. (UBS AM) related to assets in the Sweep Funds. Service fees are paid monthly at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of a Sweep Fund's average daily net assets. Revenue sharing payments for the Sweep Funds are paid to UBS by UBS AM.

An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Although each fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a

money market fund. Money market funds are sold by prospectus, which includes more complete information on risks, charges, expenses and other matters of interest. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing in a fund.

Automatic Exchanges of Certain Sweep Funds

Different Sweep Funds may be offered to clients who have Marketing Relationship assets with UBS of $25 million or more or who otherwise meet requirements established by UBS in its sole discretion. If you meet this asset threshold and own shares of the UBS RMA Government Money Market Fund through any of the UBS sweep programs, you will become eligible for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund and we will liquidate your shares in the UBS RMA Government Money Market Fund and purchase shares in the UBS Select Government Capital Fund without direction from, or prior notice to, you. Thereafter, the UBS Select Government Capital Fund will be your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option, as the case may be). Once a first purchase has been made into the fund, the UBS Select Government Capital Fund will remain your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option) even if your Marketing Relationship assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund.

Your eligibility for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund will be determined at the end of each month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund.

The Puerto Rico Fund

The Puerto Rico Fund is offered as a Sweep Option (and Secondary Sweep Option) exclusively to residents of Puerto Rico as defined in that fund's prospectus and is not available as a Sweep Option for tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs and Plans and Participants. The Puerto Rico Fund is not a money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, does not comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds and presents a higher degree of risk than those funds. The Puerto Rico Fund is not FDIC insured, may lose value and has no bank guarantee. The Puerto Rico Fund is sold by prospectus only, which may be found at www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/misc/puertoricofunds or from your Financial Advisor.

## Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements

All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By signing the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan, you agree that the Margin Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current Accounts and any eligible Accounts that you may open in the future.

Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, if you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your Margin Agreement with us will remain in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we will confirm your request.

When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin-eligible Accounts are subject to applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree to maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we deem

If you do not want to establish margin for your current accounts or any accounts you open in the future, please contact your Financial Advisor.

Please note: UBS does not extend margin for the following accounts:

- Individual Retirement Accounts
- ERISA Plans
- Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
- 403(b)(7) Accounts
- UGMAs
- UTMAs
- Estates
- 529 Plan Accounts

EFTA00024335

UBS Client Relationship Agreement

necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account to satisfy any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account.

As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we carry for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to ourselves or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for such Property.

When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in your Account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If you are engaged in short selling a security, you may incur a charge due to certain borrowing costs for that particular security.

Subject to applicable rules and regulations, we may amend the requirements applicable to your margin account at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, including, without limitation, changing the level of credit available to you and applicable maintenance requirements; all without notice to you. A prior demand or call, or prior notice of the time and place of such sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of our right to sell or buy without demand or notice as described herein. For additional terms, please refer to the section "Liquidation of Collateral or Account" below.

We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to require or obtain full or partial payment of a margin loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to all rights provided by law, we have the right to:

1. require additional collateral,
2. sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or jointly with others,
3. buy any Property which may be held short in your Account,
4. cancel any open orders and close any or all outstanding contracts, or
5. liquidate any of your Accounts with us.

We may also exercise these rights at any time in our sole and absolute discretion.

If you are an individual (including an individual acting as trustee of a trust) residing in or located in any country in the European Economic Area: you represent and warrant that you do not intend to use any part of a margin loan, and will not now or in the future use any part of a margin loan, for the acquiring or retaining of property rights in land or in an existing or projected building, or for the renovation of residential property.

You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, or otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the Loan Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet carefully for a detailed discussion of these risks.

# Security Interest

As security for the payment of all liabilities or indebtedness presently outstanding or to be incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not limited to any loans, credit lines, promissory notes or tax obligations, you hereby grant to each UBS Entity a security interest in and lien on any and all Property held or carried by any UBS Entity for you or on your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in which you may have any legal, equitable or other interest.

All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of your obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to whether or not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security interest, we have the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the Property will be sold

Hypothecation is the pledging of securities or other assets to secure a loan such as a debit balance in a margin account.

"Property" includes, but is not limited to, securities, securities entitlements, investment property and financial assets, including without limitation, money, stocks, options, bonds, notes, futures contracts, commodities, commercial paper, deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations, contracts, all other property usually and customarily dealt in by brokerage firms and any other property that can be recorded in or credited to any of your Accounts, as well as the Accounts themselves.

Please refer to the UBS Statement of Credit Practices for additional information.

"UBS Entity" refers to UBS Financial Services Inc. and each of its Affiliates.

"Securities Intermediary" means: 1) a clearing corporation; or 2) a person, including a bank or broker, that in the ordinary course of business maintains securities accounts for others and is acting in that capacity, as such terms are interpreted under Section 8-102(a)(14) of the United States Uniform Commercial Code.

EFTA00024336

and have all the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in addition to all other rights provided in this Agreement or by law.

You will not cause or allow any of the Property held in any of your UBS Accounts, whether owned now or acquired later, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, mortgages or encumbrances of any nature other than our security interest, without our prior written consent. Each UBS Entity shall act as agent for and on behalf of each UBS Entity for purposes of perfecting, maintaining and enforcing the security interests granted hereunder or by operation of law. Each UBS Entity acting in the capacity of a deposit bank, securities intermediary or commodities intermediary, agrees to follow the instructions and entitlement orders of every other UBS Entity with respect to the Property as a secured party without further consent by you. You hereby authorize and direct each UBS Entity to follow the instructions and entitlement orders of every other UBS Entity.

## Liquidation of Collateral or Account

We may satisfy any and all amounts you owe us in connection with any of your Accounts or agreements with us, or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not limited to any loans, credit lines, promissory notes or tax obligations, from Property we hold or carry in any of your Accounts with us (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation). Additionally, we may sell any or all Property held in any of your Accounts with us and cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any Property without notice in the event of your death or dissolution, bankruptcy or whenever in our sole and absolute discretion we deem it necessary for our protection. In these instances, we may also borrow or buy-in all Property held in any of your Accounts required to make delivery against any sale initiated for you. These sales or purchases may be public or private and may be made without advertising or notice to you and in the manner we determine in our sole discretion. You waive diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of nonpayment and further waive all other notices and formalities to which you may be entitled under applicable law or otherwise, to the extent the waiver of such notices and other formalities is permissible under applicable law. Your waiver will not be invalidated by any demands, calls, tenders or notices that we may make. At any sale, we may purchase the Property or any portion thereof free of any right of redemption and you will remain liable for any deficiency in any of your Accounts, plus any accrued interest on the deficiency at our then customary rate, if applicable, or at the maximum rate allowable by law. We will not be liable to you in any way for any losses or adverse tax consequences resulting from a liquidation of your Property.

## Restrictions on Trading and Disbursements

You acknowledge that we, in our sole discretion, with or without prior notice to you, may prohibit or restrict trading of any securities held in your Account, prohibit or restrict disbursements from your Account, and refuse to enter into any purchase or sale transaction with you regarding any securities that we deem high risk from a regulatory perspective, even if those securities were purchased by you through us. In addition, you understand that we maintain the right not to custody any such securities and deliver these securities to you at your expense.

## USA Patriot Act

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information and documentation identifying each account holder. Therefore, when you open an Account, we ask for your name, address, date of birth and other identifying information about you. We may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. We may also screen your name against various databases to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may take any of the actions described under "Termination of your Account" in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

Please see the UBS Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet

for further information, including how to opt out of certain information sharing.

# Your Privacy

At UBS, we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. Please refer to the UBS Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, which describes the personal information we collect about you and how we handle and protect it.

Subject to any applicable financial privacy laws and regulations, you acknowledge that we share such personal financial data regarding you and your Accounts with our affiliates and non-affiliates as is necessary or advisable to effect, administer or enforce transactions requested or authorized by you, or to service, process or maintain your Accounts and all transactions related to or in connection with your Accounts.

# Credit Report

You grant us permission to obtain a credit report when you open an Account with us and to obtain updated credit or similar reports at any time during the time your Account remains open. You grant us permission to check and verify your credit references and update all credit information we have obtained on you. We may provide any such credit report or other credit information we have obtained on you to our Card Issuers, Check Providers or to our affiliates, as permitted by law to enable them to provide additional products or services that may be of interest to you and to otherwise assist us in servicing, administering and maintaining your Account and evaluating your financial needs.

# Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership

The issuers of securities held in your Accounts may request your name, address and security position so that they may contact you directly for proxy voting and other shareholder communications. You may instruct us not to supply this information, in which case you will receive information regarding those securities from UBS instead of the issuers.

Your current instructions with respect to such disclosure are reflected on the Account Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package. If you would like to change your instructions, please call your Financial Advisor.

As described in the section "Foreign Securities" in the General Terms and Conditions of the Agreement and Disclosure Booklet, we may share information about the beneficial ownership of foreign securities in your Accounts with the issuers of those securities, foreign government authorities and their agents, custodian banks or brokers and local or international securities depositories to obtain reduced tax withholding rates, to comply with local law or to respond to other lawful requests.

# Alternate Contact Person

If you have provided UBS with an Alternate contact person, you authorize us to contact such person in the event that we have concerns or questions about you, including but not limited to your health, well-being or whereabouts. You further authorize UBS to discuss our concerns and disclose any necessary information about you including your Account information to your alternate contact. You acknowledge that this authorization will apply to all Accounts currently open and any account you open in the future in any capacity.

You understand that the decision as to whether, when or if to reach out to your alternate contact(s) is at the sole discretion of UBS and that if you have provided multiple alternate contact persons, UBS is under no obligation to reach out to any or all of them.

# Electronic Records

Any agreements accepted by facsimile or electronic means (such as clicks or other online means) are legally binding and are considered to have been "signed" by you with the same effect as manual signatures. Electronic records of an agreement that is made online will also be considered to be "in writing". You agree not to dispute the validity or enforceability of any agreements entered into electronically by you (or by anyone using your authentication devices, such as a password or PIN).

# E-mail Communications

We discourage clients from transmitting personal or confidential information through e-mail as these may be sent via unsecure servers and/or facilities which are easily accessible by third parties (such as international public and private data transmission networks and internet service providers) and are typically routed via (multiple) foreign jurisdictions. If you choose to send personal and confidential information to us via e-mail, you understand and accept that e-mail transmissions may entail a considerable amount of danger and risk including:

- lack of confidentiality (e-mails and their attachments can be read and/or monitored without detection);
- manipulation or falsification of the sender's address or of the e-mail's (or attachment's) content (e.g. changing the sender's address(es) or details);
- system outages and other transmission errors, which can cause e-mails and their attachments to be delayed, mutilated, misrouted and deleted;
- viruses, worms, Trojan horses etc. may be spread undetected by third parties and may cause considerable damage; and
- interception by third parties

and agree that we cannot be responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result, such as losses or damages arising from mistaken identity or unauthorized access and the use of the information (for any purpose) by others who may intercept or otherwise access the communications during and after transmission.

# Electronic Delivery Agreement

UBS offers certain communications through electronic delivery. Categories of communications you may enroll in for e-Delivery include:

- Trade confirmations and notices regarding Account activity.
- Shareholder communications, including annual and other shareholder reports, preliminary and final prospectuses, proxy materials and information about other corporate actions.

- Quarterly performance reports.
- UBS Equity Plan Advisory Services plan advices.
- Tax reporting documents, including 1099s and other tax documents that are available now or become available in the future.

Any member of your household may enroll any other household account in electronic delivery of these periodic communications, except for tax reporting documents. By enrolling in e-Delivery of any communications described above, you agree that we may also deliver similar firm documents electronically that may be available now or in the future. When available, confirmations of your personal and account information may be included with related documents that are delivered electronically through UBS Online Services or any other secure method.

Please note: These confirmations are sent periodically and to confirm certain changes to your Account information. These confirmations may be viewable by other members of your household through UBS Online Services or other secure methods. Contact your Financial

Advisor if you prefer to receive private, paper versions of confirmations of personal and Account information instead of electronic versions.

If you enroll in e-Delivery for any of the communications described above, the following terms and conditions will apply to all of the UBS Accounts (current and future) in your UBS statement household.

- A valid e-mail address is required for our e-Delivery services and you are responsible for notifying UBS when your e-mail address changes; you may update your e-mail address online through UBS Online Services or by calling your Financial Advisor.
- Access to UBS Online Services is required for e-Delivery of documents that contain any personal information; we may, however, deliver such documents by other secure means in the future.
- Enrollment in e-Delivery is effective immediately and may be cancelled at any time, either by changing your elections online or by contacting your Financial Advisor; we confirm cancellations and other changes to your delivery preferences by e-mail or regular mail whether they were initiated by you or UBS.
- Enrollment for any e-Delivery services for any of your Accounts will automatically apply to any accounts that you open in the future at UBS, subject to certain system limitations.
- You may request paper copies of any document we are required to deliver to you at any time for no additional charge by contacting your Financial Advisor.
- We notify you by e-mail when a new document is available; to protect your information, the electronic message generally includes a link to a secure UBS website where the document can be viewed and downloaded.
- If your e-mail address fails, we will mail paper copies of documents or a paper notice that a document is available with instructions on how to access it.
- By enrolling in e-Delivery, you confirm that you have access to a printer or other device to print or save documents you may wish to retain.
- We do not charge for e-Delivery, but your Internet access provider may have separate charges.

## Householding of Statements and Other Communications

As a convenience to you, we may consolidate periodic communications for certain accounts with the same address. This practice, called "householding", applies to account statements, trade confirmations, remittance transfer receipts, personal and financial information required to be sent by regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts statements, which provide consolidated information for all of the Accounts in your household.

Households are determined as follows:

- Accounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID Number are automatically placed in the same household.
- Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household only with the express consent of all the Account holders.

We mail household communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, if you receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or other electronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS Online Services can have access to view all Accounts in the household.

The composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household mailing address, and the addressee for household mailings may also change over time. Where owners of joint accounts live at different addresses, household mailings will be sent to at least one Account owner's address and may be included with mailings for other Accounts at that address under the conditions described above.

If you do not want your statements to be bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor.

For more information regarding electronic delivery of periodic communication for your Account, please refer to the Electronic Delivery Agreement herein.

EFTA00024340

Periodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain personal and financial information to our clients. Because we deliver these records with your account statements, other members of your household may have access to these records unless you instruct us to send them to you separately.

If you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual mailings in separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means.

## Non-Primary Residence Address for Mailing Purposes

Unless you notify us otherwise in writing, you authorize us to use the Account address you provided to mail all notices, correspondence and for the disbursement of Property, even if it is not your primary residence. Based upon this authorization, we will not telephone you to confirm receipt of property or require a signed written confirmation from you acknowledging transmittal of property. If you would like to designate an alternative mailing address for the Account, please contact your Financial Advisor to provide the necessary authorization. Even when you have provided a mailing address for the Account, some correspondence may be delivered to your legal residence address only based upon operational considerations.

## Applicable Law

This Agreement, including the Arbitration provisions below, and its enforcement, is governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to such State's choice of law or conflict of laws provisions. The Agreement is binding on you and on UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico provided that there is no inconsistency with the Federal securities laws or the Federal or State banking laws. In connection with any Card issued, the respective Cardholder Agreement shall be governed by Federal law and the law designated by the Card Issuer in that Cardholder Agreement.

In the event that any of the Arbitration provisions below are found to be unenforceable, you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the Federal courts sitting in the Southern District of New York for the purpose of determining all matters with regard to the Agreement. You also consent to service of process by certified mail to your Account's address of record, and you waive any objection to the venue and any claims that an action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and will be construed to the fullest extent permitted by law, to give effect to the intent of any provision that has been called into question.

## Arbitration

This Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement the parties agree as follows:

- All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.
- Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.
- The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.
- The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.
- The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.
- The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.

This Arbitration Agreement represents standard industry practice and binds you and UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico to arbitrate any disagreements that may arise between the parties.

"The parties" for purposes of this arbitration agreement, are UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico and you, including on behalf of your heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.

- Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange’s arbitration forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with you, including, where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

- Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the panel.

- The arbitrators shall resolve any controversy in accordance with applicable law.

- The arbitrators will apply state and federal statutes of limitation the same as if the claim were brought as a civil action in court.

- The award of the arbitration panel is not subject to appeal and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

- No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until:

- the class certification is denied; or
- the class is decertified; or
- the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein.

- You expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served by certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS.

- You expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above.
