Judge Cote signed the 6(e) order, attached.

Note: anything we send to John Langbein has to comply with EOUSA secure shipping protocols (speak to [redacted]) or EOUSA electronic encryption protocols (speak to IT services). We would look very bad if any of this ended up someplace it shouldn't. Also give Langbein the necessary cautions.
