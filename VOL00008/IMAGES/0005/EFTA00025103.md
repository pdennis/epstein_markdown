Suzanne and Johanna,

In addition to the topic we discussed this morning, we wanted to let you know that we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss with your client the allegations set forth on page 7 of the attached complaint, as a follow up to some of the topics from our last meeting.

We're of course happy to discuss with you at your office before we start this afternoon.

Thanks,

Hi Suzanne,

Do you have a few minutes for a quick call in advance of our meeting tomorrow? Nothing urgent, but we wanted to check in with you about the scope of topics for tomorrow's meeting.

Between [redacted], [redacted], and me, some combination of our team should be available most times between now and our meeting tomorrow (with the exception of 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. today), if there's a time that works best for you today or tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
