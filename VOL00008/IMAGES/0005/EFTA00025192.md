Hi _________________,

I just had a quick question about how to mark a couple of these documents. For some reason USPV00341820-26 were blank. I tried clicking image and extracted text and those didn't help. Also, for the documents USVP00341831-S1, skipping some here and there, they said "Browser does not support this multimedia format". I marked all of these "For further review", is this how you want them marked or do you want me to change that to something else?

Thank you,
