Following up on this, not sure if you guys have had time to check this yet, but attached is the subscriber info I have—but worth checking on your end to see if you have returns from Yahoo as well. Can we discuss later this afternoon whether a GPS or pen makes sense? Thanks.

Hi [REDACTED],

Thanks, we'll take a look—if you could send over a summary of her flights with him over the past 6 months, that would be helpful. Have you guys looked at the phone numbers associated with the email accounts we got subscriber info for? Let us know if you think any of those numbers are live.

Thanks,
