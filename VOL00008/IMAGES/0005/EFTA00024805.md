Team,

Checking in on the status for the motions. I’m attaching the NPA point draft, which can be folded in. Can folks let me know the status of pending motion points, for planning purposes? I think our deadline to get this to the chiefs is EOD today, so ideally we’d combine this by this afternoon and circulate quickly around the team for edits.

Thanks all—
