Here you go. Almost everything is over at Southern once I drop off the phones. Just 1 laptop and 2 desktops to get to you. 1 has to re-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have already produced, I can re-work it to split things out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get something moving. Any questions, let me know.
