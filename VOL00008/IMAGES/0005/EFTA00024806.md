On October 20, 2005, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Thursday morning, I was advised by Captain [redacted] that a search warrant would be executed and that I was to assemble the Crime Scene Investigative Team and stand by the south side of the building ready to go. I designated Evidence Specialist [redacted] to handle the inventory return, the documentation of the property receipts and the collection and bagging of the evidence at the scene. I further instructed CSI [redacted], ID # [redacted], to accompany us and perform the role of photographing the scene and the items that may be taken into custody by the affiant, Detective J [redacted], ID # [redacted].

My responsibility was to go through from the reading of the warrant to the final exit from the residence and perform a video recording of the reading of the warrant, the initial walk through of the residence showing the current condition and then finally a walk through of the residence at the time of the police exit.

We started out towards the residence, which was located at [redacted] and arrived at approximately 9:33 a.m. The search was conducted, items were collected by Evidence Specialists [redacted],
