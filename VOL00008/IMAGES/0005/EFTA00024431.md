Subject: Jeffrey Epstein consultation fees

Dear Madam,

My late father John Kendall Rowlands was an art historian and art collector. He assisted Jeffrey Epstein in sourcing and disposing of works of art and may very well have loaned items to him as well. I understand that Jeffrey Epstein owed him a substantial sum of money in consultation fees in relation to works of art and that I would therefore have a claim on the estate in consideration of this.

My father did mention in passing the presence of young girls with Jeffrey Epstein and had he not sadly died I expect my father would have reported his concerns to the relevant authorities

I need to communicate with the US Attorney Geoffrey Berman in charge of the case against Jeffrey Epstein – can you therefore please pass this information on to him. My postal address is:-

David Rowlands

Email:  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;

Tel  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp;

I attach scans of my passport, birth certificate and my father’s death certificate along with my most recent phonebill as proof of my address and identity / connection.

Yours faithfully,

David Rowlands
