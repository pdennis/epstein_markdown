## Waiver Explanation
The National Enquirer is a news organization. Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), the Enquirer is entitled to a fee waiver because disclosure of the information sought is in the public interest, is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

## Documentation Files

# Non-Individual FOIA Request

## Request Information
Please see attached pdf for the National Enquirer's FOIA request concerning the investigation and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 2006 for crimes relating to sexual trafficking of minors.

# Expedite

## Expedite Reason
This request has been the subject of the request is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity which affects public confidence. Specifically; the issue of whether Mr. Epstein's wealth and connections secured him favorable treatment by the DOJ.

Given that a civil defamation trial between one of Epstein's victims and his alleged co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, has just begun, the topic is of renewed interest to the public and therefore is worthy of expedited processing.

VIA FOIA PORTAL

TO: Federal Bureau of Investigation

FROM: James Robertson
Senior Managing Editor
The National Enquirer
4 New York Plaza (2nd Floor)
New York, NY 10004
(212) 743-6555

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a reporter and editor for The National Enquirer. I request records under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552.

## Request

The Enquirer seeks all documents relating to the FBI's investigation and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein, who pled guilty to one count of felony solicitation of prostitution in August 2006.

## Background

Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women claimed that they had been trafficked by Epstein to perform sexual acts on him as well as his friends.

Many prominent political figures have been connected to Mr. Epstein's child-trafficking ring, including former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family.

Links: (Bill Clinton) http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html; (Prince Andrew) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/jeffrey-epstein-decade-scandal-prince-andrew

Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice agreed to allow Epstein to plead guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida state law, and served only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against Epstein's alleged co-conspirators.

Papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that Epstein surreptitiously recorded sexual activity between prominent individuals and underage girls for purposes of blackmail, leaving many to wonder whether potential blackmail material played a role in his light sentence:

Link: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/prince-andrew-might-have-been-caught-tape-sex-slave-1407641

## Expedited Processing

This request has been the subject of the request is of widespread and exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the government's integrity which affects public confidence. Specifically; the issue of whether Mr. Epstein’s wealth and connections secured him favorable treatment by the DOJ.

Given the a civil defamation trial between one of Epstein’s victims and his alleged co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, is about to begin, the topic is of renewed interest to the public and therefore is worthy of expedited processing.

## Certification

The above information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

## Fee Waiver

The National Enquirer is a news organization. Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), the Enquirer is entitled to a fee waiver because disclosure of the information sought is in the public interest, is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

## Electronic Records

Please furnish all responsive records in electronic format.

## Further Correspondence

All correspondence regarding this request can be directed to me at jrobertson@amilink.com

Please be aware that under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A), a FOIA request is considered constructively denied after twenty business days.

FOIPA Request No.: 1372398-000
Subject: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY

Dear Mr. Robertson:

This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the FBI. The FOIPA number listed above has been assigned to your request.

You submitted your request via the FBI's eFOIA system.

☐ We have reviewed your request and determined that it is compliant with the terms and conditions of the eFOIA system. You will continue to receive correspondence online.

☑ We have reviewed your request and determined that it is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the eFOIA system. Future correspondence will be mailed to you.

You have requested records concerning one or more third party individuals. The FBI recognizes an important privacy interest in the requested information. To continue processing your request regarding a third party, submit one of the following: (1) an authorization and consent from the individual(s) (i.e., express authorization and consent of the third party); (2) proof of death (i.e., proof that your subject is deceased); or (3) a justification that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy (i.e., a clear demonstration that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy interests). In the absence of such information, the FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records responsive to your request, which, if they were to exist, would be exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C).

Express authorization and consent. If you seek disclosure of any existing records on this basis, enclosed is a Certification of Identity form. You may make additional copies of this form if you are requesting information on more than one individual. The subject of your request should complete this form and then sign it. Alternatively, the subject may prepare a document containing the required descriptive data and have it notarized. The original certification of identity or notarized authorization with the descriptive information must contain a legible, original signature before FBI can conduct an accurate search of our records.

Proof of death. If you seek disclosure of any existing records on this basis, proof of death can be a copy of a death certificate, Social Security Death Index, obituary, or another recognized reference source. Death is presumed if the birth date of the subject is more than 100 years ago.

Public Interest Disclosure. If you seek disclosure of any existing records on this basis, you must demonstrate that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy interests. In this regard, you must show that the public interest sought is a significant one, and that the requested information is likely to advance that interest.

Fax your request to the Work Process Unit at (540) 868-4997, or mail to 170 Marcel Drive, Winchester, VA 22602. If we do not receive a response from you within 30 days from the date of this letter, your request will be closed. You must include the FOIPA request number with any communication regarding this matter.

EFTA00024039

For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). As such, this response is limited to those records, if any exist, that are subject to the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.

You may file an appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, Suite 11050, 1425 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20530-0001, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIAonline portal by creating an account on the following web site: https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home. Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within ninety (90) days from the date of this letter in order to be considered timely. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked "Freedom of Information Act Appeal." Please cite the FOIPA Request Number assigned to your request so that it may be easily identified.

You may seek dispute resolution services by contacting the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at 877-684-6448, or by emailing ogis@nara.gov. Alternatively, you may contact the FBI's FOIA Public Liaison by emailing foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov. If you submit your dispute resolution correspondence by email, the subject heading should clearly state "Dispute Resolution Services." Please also cite the FOIPA Request Number assigned to your request so that it may be easily identified.

For questions on how to reasonably describe your request, please email us at foipaquestions@ic.fbi.gov. You may also visit www.fbi.gov and select "Services," "Records Management," and "Freedom of Information/Privacy Act" for additional guidance.

FBI FACT SHEET

- The primary functions of the FBI are national security and law enforcement.
- The FBI does not keep a file on every citizen of the United States.
- The FBI was not established until 1908 and we have very few records prior to the 1920s.
- FBI files generally contain reports of FBI investigations of a wide range of matters, including counterterrorism, counter-intelligence, cyber crime, public corruption, civil rights, organized crime, white collar crime, major thefts, violent crime, and applicants.
- The FBI does not issue clearances or non-clearances for anyone other than its own personnel or persons having access to FBI facilities. Background investigations for security clearances are conducted by many different Government agencies. Persons who received a clearance while in the military or employed with some other government agency should contact that entity. Most government agencies have websites which are accessible on the internet which have their contact information.
- An identity history summary check or “rap sheet” is NOT the same as an “FBI file.” It is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and related documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, naturalization or military service. The subject of a “rap sheet” may obtain a copy by submitting a written request to FBI CJIS Division – Summary Request, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 26306. Along with a specific written request, the individual must submit a new full set of his/her fingerprints in order to locate the record, establish positive identification, and ensure that an individual’s records are not disseminated to an unauthorized person. The fingerprint submission must include the subject’s name, date and place of birth. There is a required fee of $18 for this service, which must be submitted by money order or certified check made payable to the Treasury of the United States. A credit card payment option is also available. Forms for this option and additional directions may be obtained by accessing the FBI Web site at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks.
- The National Name Check Program (NNCP) conducts a search of the FBI’s Universal Index (UNI) to identify any information contained in FBI records that may be associated with an individual and provides the results of that search to a requesting federal, state or local agency. Names are searched in a multitude of combinations and phonetic spellings to ensure all records are located. The NNCP also searches for both “main” and “cross reference” files. A main file is an entry that carries the name corresponding to the subject of a file, while a cross reference is merely a mention of an individual contained in a file. The results from a search of this magnitude can result in several “hits” and “idents” on an individual. In each instance where UNI has identified a name variation or reference, information must be reviewed to determine if it is applicable to the individual in question.
- The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for records and provides copies of FBI files responsive to Freedom of Information or Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for information. RIDS provides responsive documents to requesters seeking “reasonably described information.” For a FOIPA search, the subject’s name, event, activity, or business is searched to determine whether there is an associated investigative file. This is called a “main file search” and differs from the NNCP search.

# FBI FOIPA Addendum

As referenced in our letter, the FBI FOIPA Addendum includes information applicable to your request. Part 1 of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. If you submitted a request regarding yourself or another person, Part 2 includes additional standard responses that apply to requests for individuals. If you have questions regarding the standard responses in Parts 1 or 2, visit the www.fbi.gov/foia website under “Contact Us.” Previously mentioned appeal and dispute resolution services are also available. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find useful.

## Part 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests

(i) 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the fbi.gov website.

(ii) National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and foreign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests for records about individuals [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.C § 3024(i)(1)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3); 50 USC § 3024(i)(1). This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not exist.

## Part 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals

(i) Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any individual’s name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.

(ii) Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist.

## Part 3: General Information:

(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by searching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by searching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its dual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters (“FBIHQ”), FBI Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices (“Legats”) worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records.

(ii) FBI Records
Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, subject, or entity.

(iii) Requests for Criminal History Records or “Rap Sheets.” The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division provides Identity History Summary Checks—often referred to as a criminal history record or “rap sheets.” These criminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative “FBI file.” An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be submitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.

The National Name Check Program (NNCP). The mission of NNCP is to analyze and report information in response to name check requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national security. Please be advised that this is a service provided to other federal agencies. Private citizens cannot request a name check.

# FBI FOIPA Addendum

As referenced in our letter, the FBI FOIPA Addendum includes information applicable to your request. Part 1 of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. If you submitted a request regarding yourself or another person, Part 2 includes additional standard responses that apply to requests for individuals. If you have questions regarding the standard responses in Parts 1 or 2, visit the www.fbi.gov/foia website under “Contact Us.” Previously mentioned appeal and dispute resolution services are also available. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find useful.

## Part 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests

(i) 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the fbi.gov website.

(ii) National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and foreign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests for records about individuals [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.C § 3024(i)(1)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3); 50 USC § 3024(i)(1). This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not exist.

## Part 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals

(i) Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any individual’s name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.

(ii) Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist.

## Part 3: General Information:

(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by searching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by searching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its dual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters (“FBIHQ”), FBI Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices (“Legats”) worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records.

(ii) FBI Records
Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, subject, or entity.

(iii) Requests for Criminal History Records or “Rap Sheets.” The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division provides Identity History Summary Checks—often referred to as a criminal history record or “rap sheets.” These criminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative “FBI file.” An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be submitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.

The National Name Check Program (NNCP). The mission of NNCP is to analyze and report information in response to name check requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national security. Please be advised that this is a service provided to other federal agencies. Private citizens cannot request a name check.

If you submitted a request regarding yourself or another person, Part 2 includes additional standard responses that apply to requests for individuals. If you have questions regarding the standard responses in Parts 1 or 2, visit the www.fbi.gov/foia website under “Contact Us.” Previously mentioned appeal and dispute resolution services are also available. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find useful.

## Part 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests

(i) 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the fbi.gov website.

(ii) National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and foreign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests for records about individuals [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.C § 3024(i)(1)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3); 50 USC § 3024(i)(1). This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not exist.

## Part 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals

(i) Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any individual’s name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.

(ii) Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist.

## Part 3: General Information:

(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by searching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by searching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its dual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters (“FBIHQ”), FBI Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices (“Legats”) worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records.

(ii) FBI Records

Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, subject, or entity.

(iii) Requests for Criminal History Records or “Rap Sheets.” The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division provides Identity History Summary Checks—often referred to as a criminal history record or “rap sheets.” These criminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative “FBI file.” An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be submitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.

(iv) The National Name Check Program (NNCP). The mission of NNCP is to analyze and report information in response to name check requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national security. Please be advised that this is a service provided to other federal agencies. Private citizens cannot request a name check.

# FBI FOIPA Addendum

As referenced in our letter, the FBI FOIPA Addendum includes information applicable to your request. Part 1 of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. If you submitted a request regarding yourself or another person, Part 2 includes additional standard responses that apply to requests for individuals. If you have questions regarding the standard responses in Parts 1 or 2, visit the www.fbi.gov/foia website under “Contact Us.” Previously mentioned appeal and dispute resolution services are also available. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find useful.

## Part 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests

(i) 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the fbi.gov website.

(ii) National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and foreign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests for records about individuals [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.C § 3024(i)(1)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3); 50 USC § 3024(i)(1). This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not exist.

## Part 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals

(i) Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any individual’s name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.

(ii) Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist.

## Part 3: General Information:

(i) Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by searching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by searching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its dual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters (“FBIHQ”), FBI Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices (“Legats”) worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records.

(ii) FBI Records
Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, subject, or entity.

(iii) Requests for Criminal History Records or “Rap Sheets.” The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division provides Identity History Summary Checks—often referred to as a criminal history record or “rap sheets.” These criminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative “FBI file.” An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be submitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.

The National Name Check Program (NNCP). The mission of NNCP is to analyze and report information in response to name check requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national security. Please be advised that this is a service provided to other federal agencies. Private citizens cannot request a name check.
