Marc and Andy,

I'm writing to ask for one point of clarification regarding the estate's position regarding the assertion of attorney-client privilege. You previously conveyed to us that the estate asserted privilege with respect to devices the FBI seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI in 2019. We accordingly assembled a firewall team to conduct a privilege review of the contents of those devices.

The FBI is also in possession of a computer that the Palm Beach Police Department seized from Epstein's residence in Palm Beach in 2005, which our office has not reviewed. Is the estate also asserting privilege with respect to devices such as this one that were seized in Florida in 2005?

Thank you,
