Are we planning to leave just these FirstBank Puerto Rico records or are there other bank records that we want to leave?

Hi [REDACTED],

For the Epstein case, are you able to assist with getting a copy of some recent bank subpoena returns to our case agent, [REDACTED].? We were hoping to leave a copy for her downstairs at 1 Saint Andrews sometime this week. I'm not sure who might be in the office to handle this, but if you could possibly coordinate that, it would be extremely helpful.

Thanks!

The returns are saved here:

Much appreciated—
