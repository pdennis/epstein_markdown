Hi

In a moment, I'll forward you two emails with subpoena returns from UBS. Could you please unzip the files (password below), save them in the Epstein shared, update the subpoena tracker, and reach out to [redacted] to provide him with a copy?

Thanks!

You're welcome. The password for all is Max_0707. Winzip directions are attached and 7-zip.org is also useful for opening files.

Counsel,

I am sending, in multiple emails, account statements for 2020. Once I receive confirmation of receipt, I will send the password.

I have also requested a CD containing account statements for 2018 and 2019; I anticipate overnighting it tomorrow for delivery on Thursday.
