Can we please add these to the pending production to send out tonight? They should marked confidential. The black book should be described in the index as "Scan of 1 bound black address book marked Government Exhibit 52, as referred to in SDNY_GM_02753612"; "Scan of 2 stapled handwritten set of documents on yellow legal pad paper, as referred to in SDNY_GM_02753612"

Can you resend me the updated cover letter once that is ready?

Thanks!
