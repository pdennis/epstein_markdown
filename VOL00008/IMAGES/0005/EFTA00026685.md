Mr. Kaiser,

Thank you again for speaking with us today in connection with our investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. As we mentioned on the phone, we are interested in speaking with your client, and we appreciate her willingness to meet with us. So you have the contact info for all of our team, we can all be reached anytime at the emails here or via phone at:

As we spoke about a few minutes ago, we would be happy to meet with you and your client at our office this Friday, July 12, at 2:00 p.m. We're located at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza, in downtown Manhattan – the office is right by the Brooklyn Bridge 4/5/6 and J/Z subway stop, or with a few blocks of various Chambers Street stops on other lines. If you've ever been to 1 Police Plaza, it's right next door, slightly behind a large red outdoor sculpture. And if you have any issues finding the building, you can call me directly – [redacted]. When you get to the building, just let security know you're here to see me and I'll come down and bring you in.

Please let me know if you have any questions at all, or if it would be useful to talk further before Friday, and thank you again.
