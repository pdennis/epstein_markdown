Hi guys – this is a long shot, but by any chance do you happen to have a cell phone number for Judge Pitman’s deputy? Or even an email address? We’ve been asked to try to tee up the Epstein unsealing for him tomorrow morning—I think we could just call him at 9:00 when the court opens, but far more important people than I would like us to try to reach out today. We have all the Moses duty info since she’s on this weekend, but nothing for Pitman (and he doesn’t list any email address in his individual rules). Thanks either way!
