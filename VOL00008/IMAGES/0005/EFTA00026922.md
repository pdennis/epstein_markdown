Don't change your plans. We'll make 10 am work to accommodate important and busy schedule.

I'd have to move something but can do if nothing else works. I am wide open between 12 and 3 if there's anything good during that time.

This afternoon isn't ideal. I can do 6pm if absolutely necessary, but I would prefer any time tomorrow morning.
