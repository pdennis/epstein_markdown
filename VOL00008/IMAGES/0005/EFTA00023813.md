Gary,

We are available for a preliminary call this Friday, January 10. If it would be convenient for you, we are available at 9:00 local time for us (which I believe would be 14:00 your time). If that works, we can plan to call you at your office line unless you'd prefer we use another number or a conference line.

thank you,

Mr. Bloxsome,

Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date.

Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance.

Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch.

Regards,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
