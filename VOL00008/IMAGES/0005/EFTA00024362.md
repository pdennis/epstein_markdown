We talked about the agent's timing, so I wanted to let you know that the plane that will fly the agents down (48 agents in total) will take off at 9 a.m. tomorrow. If it is at all possible to know from Judge Miller before then whether she is prepared to sign the application, our team would be very grateful.

As we just discussed, I'm attaching a copy of the application that highlights the paragraphs that were revised. I've also attached a slightly updated clean version of the draft, which fixes a small typo I saw (which is also fixed in the highlighted version).

Thanks,

Subject: revised search warrant

Thanks again for your help today, and for being flexible while we evaluated how to proceed today. Attached is the revised application. The exhibits are the same as before, but I'm attaching them again just so you have the complete package. I'll call you in a moment to discuss logistics.

Special Agent [redacted] is copied here. The FBI would greatly appreciate it if we could swear out the warrant first thing in the morning, if at all possible.

Thanks very much--
