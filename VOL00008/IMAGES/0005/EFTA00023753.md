Hi _________________________.

I'm an AUSA in EDNY and am working on an investigation into the death of an inmate at the Brooklyn MDC. The OCME told me that it signed a confidentiality agreement in connection with the investigation into the murder of Jeffrey Epstein. We were hoping to extend a similar agreement and I wanted to see if you could share the agreement (or a boilerplate version of it).

I'm happy to speak over the phone if that's easier. My cell is _________________________.

Thanks so much,
