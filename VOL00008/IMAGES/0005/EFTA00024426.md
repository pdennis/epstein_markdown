Hi,

The below emails apparently did not go through to Judge Berman or his clerk. Would it be possible to check and see why that might be?

Thanks.

Dear Judge Berman,

We received a request from the Court for the contact information for victim attorneys. Not all victims are represented by counsel, but the attorneys we are aware of are:

EFTA00024426

Although the Government has made best efforts to notify victims of tomorrow's proceeding, the Government does not know which victims plan to attend tomorrow's conference, and it is possible that victims the Government is not aware of may attend.

We have not copied defense counsel here, in order to respect the privacy of the victims.

Respectfully,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
New York, NY 10007
