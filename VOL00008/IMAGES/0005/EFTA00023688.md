How are we handling producing to Maxwell vs. Counsel? With these files there are tons of text and excel files that need to be converted in order to be sent to MDC. Are we also producing the converted versions to defense or rather the original natives?

No way to put a confidential stamp on an excel file. There should be an image placeholder that says document produced in native format which has the confidential stamp.

Thanks. These look great. One quick question, on documents in native format (excel files) is there a confidential stamp? I've checked and it seems the answer is no but I just want to be sure that I'm not missing anything.

These documents are not supposed to be privileged reviewed. The only documents that need to be privilege reviewed are the electronic search warrant returns.

Thanks,

The data is probably secured for privilege review. Please let me know if these documents are not supposed to be privileged reviewed.

Thank you.

Hey

When I click on each of those links I'm brought to a Relativity page with no data. Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,

1. Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential
2. We are working on that.
3. I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can.
4. That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp them.

Thanks!

I know you want to produce these documents can you please tell me the following:

1. Will you placing a Confidential stamp on these documents?
2. What bates number do you wish to use on the documents?
3. How do you want to produce the documents (single page tiff images, database load files or PDF production).
4. Also please note that once the documents have been loaded to Relativity there is no way to run any searches for these images since they are mostly images and video.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.

Hey,

We have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent to Relativity and should be ready by tomorrow. Do you want to see them first or can they go directly to PAE?

Folder/Subfolder in Relativity: US v. Epstein → FBI Case File → Images Seized During Search
