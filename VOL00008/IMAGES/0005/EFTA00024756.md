Dr. Hughes,
Together with colleagues
I'm one of the federal prosecutors handling
the case of United States v. Christine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 2021 in the
Southern District of New York. We would be interested in speaking with you about your availability to
testify as an expert witness at trial. Are you available for a call tomorrow or next week to discuss?
