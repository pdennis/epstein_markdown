Subject: US v Jeffery Epstein

Counsel:

As Duty Assistant yesterday, the EDNY received this phone call from a potential witness in the Epstein case. Though referred to the FBI, he indicated he only wished to speak to someone from the USAO. Having failed to get someone at the SDNY he called here. An investigator from our office witnessed the call and his Memorandum of the call is attached. We indicated that we would refer the matter to you and that an investigator from the SDNY might be in contact with him.
