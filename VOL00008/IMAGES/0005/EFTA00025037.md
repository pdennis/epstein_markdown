Attachments: 2021.10.25_Letter_to_Judge_Nathan_re_Extension_of_Time.DOCX

Attached is the letter we intend to file with the Court regarding the extension to file the jury charge. It should reflect everything we discussed on our call earlier today.

Please let me know if you have any issues with it as soon as you can. I'd like to file it in the next hour or so.

Thanks,

Chris

I think I have a way to come to an agreement on this. I know today is extremely busy for all of us, but can you and I have a 5 min. call to discuss? I don't think everyone from SDNY needs to be on this call, but I leave that to you.

Thanks,

Chris

Hi Chris,

I think the answer is yes, but just to make sure: we'd file the Government's proposal on Wednesday, you'd file whatever redline you like on November 3. It also occurs to us that, since your redline will presumably contain new proposals/objections to ours and would not include our views, we'd want to file a short reply on November 5 or 8.

We'd consent to that option and, if you like, would join your motion for that schedule.

Thanks,

Hi

I just want to clarify the redline option. If we did the redline option, would you file the government's RTC (without defense comment) on Oct. 27 and then we would file the joint RTC (i.e., our redline of your RTCs) on Nov. 3? And you would consent to that option?

Thanks,

Chris

Hi Chris,

We had another idea that might facilitate things. We know Judge Nathan asked for a joint RTC, but what about asking Judge Nathan to let us file separate ones? We would also be comfortable setting a deadline for the defense RTC (or a defense redline of ours) on November 3.

If you were to make a request to file separate RTCs, with your deadline on November 3, we would join that request.

Thanks,

Hi

Given all of the other things we have going on this week, the defense would like a little more time to submit the joint requests to charge. We plan to ask the Court for an extension until Monday, Nov. 1. Does the government consent to that request?

Thanks,

Chris
