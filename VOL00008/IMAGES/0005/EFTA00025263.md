Good evening,
It will be tomorrow! You can follow up with [REDACTED] at MCC New York in the interim. There will hopefully be a new attorney on board (and even two!) at MDC Brooklyn in the very near future.
Thank you so much - I really appreciate it. If you need anything this evening, or tomorrow, please let me know. And even thereafter, I'll only be a phone call or email away if you need.

Best,

- was today your last day or is it tomorrow? Do you know who I can be following up with re Ghislaine Maxwell?
I wish you the best in your next endeavor, and thank you for all of your service!
