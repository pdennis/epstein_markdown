I know you guys are on top of this, but to keep myself organized, for tomorrow's production, we need to include the below on the drives. Attaching the witness list and cover letter to get us started. If I'm missing anything, let me know! Thanks again for all of your hard work!!

1. Witness list
2. Cover letter
3. 3500 Indices
4. 3500 productions
5. GX index
6. GX exhibits (for GM, redacted nudity)
7. Prior GM productions we told defense counsel we would provide to the defendant at the MDC (that would be 10/4, 10/7, and hopefully tomorrow's as well).
