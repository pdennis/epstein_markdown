I thought they also participated in the interview of [redacted], which was done as part of the Epstein investigation, when he took 5?

We probably should have included them. My fault. I'll call Guido and apologize.

Did [redacted] participate in the first interview of [redacted] before we got involved? I think that was it ...

I'm not aware of any. They were included in the press release because they were going to provide some assistance with the arrest.

Maybe I'm totally spacing something out, but which OIG agent worked on this?

Good morning  &lt;  &gt;

I wanted to follow up on a press release from your office from earlier this week entitled, "Acting U.S. Attorney Announces Charges Against Correctional Officer Who Demanded Bribe In The Form Of Sex From A Female Prison Visitor."

The press release lists DOI OIG as a supporting law enforcement agency at the end of the release. However, I spoke with our Special Agent in Charge in New York and we believe we should have been listed as an announcing agency. Our contributions to this case were significant, and we'd ask that for future press releases, you include our SAC as an announcing official. Please feel free to reach out with any questions, I'm at 202-579-7511.

Thank you.
