Do those say what Room A, Room B, Room C, etc. are?

I have the blueprints...I can take a picture of those and send to you. That way you'll have a visual.

Thanks [REDACTED]! Do you have a map or chart that can tell me which part of the residence corresponds to each room letter in this chart?

Hey [REDACTED],

Wanted to get this to you. This spreadsheet contains all evidence seized in NY. Let me know if you have any issues/concerns.

Thanks,

Hey [REDACTED],

Both myself and [REDACTED] were pulled this week to assist with the riots and looting currently happening in Manhattan. Hopefully this does not go on for too long. When we return to the office we will be sure to fill in those blanks for you and hopefully, once again get back on track.

Be safe.

Hi ___________ and ___________.

Any chance you'd be able to help fill in the attached chart with the specific location in the NY mansion where each device was recovered (similar to the chart you sent me for the USVI devices), please? Once I get that, I can put together the revised warrant.

Thanks,
