&gt;&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I got the below text from , an AUSA in Boston, about a potential Epstein victim. Can I put her in touch with you? Thanks!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a non-drug related question for you. Can you tell me who in your office is/was handling the Epstein case? Long story short, a friend of a family friend was a model in NYC 20 years ago and was taken to Epstein's townhouse one night. Not sure what happened bc I haven't spoken to her yet, but I understand something happened. She has talked to David Boise, and his firm is now all over her with calls and she doesn't know what to do. I said i would talk to you but don't know if your office is still involved in the case at all or is in touch with victims. If so, I can steer her in the right direction. I know it's an odd text, so thanks for any connection you can make for me. Thanks and look forward to seeing you in DC.
