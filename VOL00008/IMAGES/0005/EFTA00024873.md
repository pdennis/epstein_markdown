- With apologies, any chance we can push this call to 4:30?

Perfect. I'll leave logistics to you.

Sure, no problem. Would 4 tomorrow work for you? If so, we can give you a call then or circulate a dial in if that's easier.

, we're not clear about what you mean by "the materials [OPR] obtained," and we need to consider issues raised by having OPR provide its records for a case in litigation. Could I speak with you (or whoever on your team you wish) to get a better understanding of what you're looking to get?

I'm available tomorrow afternoon at or after 3:30, or anytime Wednesday.

Best regards,

Thanks very much, [REDACTED]. This is extremely helpful. I think it does make sense for us to talk further about how we might be able to get copies from you of the materials you obtained, including the 500,000+ emails and the 15-20,000 scanned hard copy documents. I've copied our team, whom I believe you've been in touch with already, [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. Would you mind if I put them back in touch with you or the appropriate person in your office to talk through the logistics of obtaining copies of these materials?

Thanks again,

AUSA

Chief, Public Corruption

USAO-SDNY

Following are some numbers you requested.

1. Total number of email files obtained for the 5 subjects → approximately 516,000.

This does not count attachments (e.g., correspondence, drafts, final documents, press report, etc.) as separate files.

Note that for subjects who left the USAO during the pendency of the Epstein case, there are fewer, and that the line AUSA (who remained involved with the CVRA litigation until mid-2019) accounts for the vast majority of the files.

2. It is our best ballpark estimate that we determined approximately 3,000 unique emails were directly relevant to OPR's investigation, but we certainly considered a larger universe.

3. Our best (most useful) collection of scanned-in USAO hard copy documents is from the CVRA litigation, and includes both the production to petitioners (3,754 pages), and a separate collection of privileged documents/records (about 15,267 pages) that were submitted to the court (and that remained privileged). We also have hundreds of pages of other case documents in both hard copy format and electronically, but they are largely duplicative of these two sets and are difficult to quantify.

We hope this is helpful.
