Subject: Call with Katya Jestin
Date: Wed, 12 May 2021 01:04:17 +0000

Today I spoke with Katya Jestin. Katya had previously indicated that she represents a wealthy, anonymous client who wishes to provide financial assistance to victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Katya had asked whether our office could connect her with attorneys who represent Epstein victims. Previously, I had told Katya I would get back to her.

During today's call, I indicated that our team could not and would not play any role in connecting Katya's client with Epstein victims. I indicated that we could not provide any information regarding the names or contact information of any victim attorneys. I explained that we could not be involved in any way in conveying funding from Katya's client to any potential witnesses in our case. To date, I have not conveyed any information about Katya's request to any witnesses or witness counsel in this case.

Katya indicated that she understood our position and appreciated our team's consideration.
