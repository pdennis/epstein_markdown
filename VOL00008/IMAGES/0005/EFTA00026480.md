Hi &gt;&gt;

Passing this on. It's pretty aggressive to try to contact me through the school where I teach, but defer to you on how to respond, if at all.

Thanks,

Hello,

I am a reporter from The Hill, and I wanted to seek any comment you may have on Ghislaine Maxwell seeking private screenings of potential jurors.

If you have any statement on this, please feel free to reach out.

I apologize for reaching out to you via your Columbia University email address, but wanted to be sure to reach you in the event you would like to provide a statement.

Best,
Monique Beals
