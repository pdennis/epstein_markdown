Hi everyone. One of our shared challenges in this time is nurturing the sense of community that’s so important to what we do—that spirit of shared purpose which brings us together in good times and bad to celebrate, laugh, and reflect.

Last week brought some very public milestones: a civil settlement that held Novartis accountable for years of illicit kickbacks and the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell.

But so much your important work is happening outside the spotlight, and I wanted to take a moment to celebrate that as well. So thank you to everyone who has taken on new gun cases to help combat the recent rise in violence; thank you to everyone handling the civil and criminal litigation around incarceration in the Covid era with thoughtfulness and care; [civil example]; thank you to all of our unsung AUSAs, paralegals, and staff. We miss seeing you every day, but we celebrate your efforts today and always. This District is lucky to have you.

Until next time, stay safe and keep up the great work.
