Subject: RE: for the AUSA handling the new investigation

We just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current / latest girlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from her lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It sounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new investigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate.

thanks,
