Yea that probably works. Or else sometime in the fall when covid is totally gone since Doud is old.

So maybe we aim for a mid-July date for Doud, if defense can do it? And assuming you can still do it.

Here's my chaotic summer schedule:

- 5/24: U.S. v. Steve Bannon et al (3-4 weeks probably)
- 6/21: U.S. v. Noel (MCC Epstein guards) (1 week)
- 8/16: U.S. v. Adams (MCC guard bribery) (1 week)
- U.S. v. Lev Parnas et al (2-3 weeks) = was scheduled for March but judge moving it to some times in August – October 2021. I'll know in the next week or two what the date is.

I'm not thinking I'll be able to do all of these. Doud would be top 3 trial for me but probably not #1.
