Thanks very much. Attached are some comments. Once the team has had a chance to review, we can discuss whether we might want to do a "cleanup" superseder to fix any statutory language in the indictment, or whether any issues are either harmless or can be resolved by not giving the indictment to the jury (or amending/redacting the version that goes back to cure any issues).

Thanks!

Hi all,

EFTA00023892

Attached is a draft RTC for your review. I've left in some comment bubbles to flag some of the judgment calls, and I'm going to clean up the cites/do a citecheck.

Looking forward to your comments.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
