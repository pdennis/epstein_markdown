Thanks very much. 1pm works. 3:30 would be tough for me.

I'm thinking we actually push this back to tomorrow afternoon. It looks as though a few of the reviewers have already logged off and I want to make sure they have time to read and review the protocol and warrant. I'm going to propose tomorrow at either 1:00 or 3:30 if that works.

I'm going to relay this to our assembled team. Rather than ask all of them what time works it would be easier to propose a couple times and go from there. Would tomorrow morning around 10:00 be an okay time to propose? I don't want to schedule a time that would conflict with anything you have going on.

Subject: Epstein Image/Video File Review Protocol

All,

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell.

Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:</fcel></fcel></fcel></fcel></fcel></fcel></fcel>

- NYC024363
- NYC024394
- NYC024326
- NYC024368
- NYC024390
- NYC024334
- NYC027910
- NYC024323
- NYC024355
- NYC027908

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the teams.

Thanks very much,
