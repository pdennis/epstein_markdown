So there does appear to be a Marius Fortelni, originally from Austria, currently living in Southampton, NY – see:

Notably—given the “residence” entry on the passport—according to Mr. Fortelni’s website he resided for a time in Saudi Arabia. If it’s possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni’s birthday, and see if it matches up with the date on the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein’s photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein’s mansion?? Given the time pressure I think it’s totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y’all.

Thank you!!
