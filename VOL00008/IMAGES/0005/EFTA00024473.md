Subject: Question re SDFL Epstein file

Hi

Hope you're doing well. As we continue our review of materials from the prior Florida investigation into Epstein, we've realized that the SDFL team assigned what appears to be a unique Jane Doe number (e.g., Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2) to each of the victims SDFL identified. We have not been able to find a key matching up each Jane Doe number with the corresponding victim name. Any chance you would be able to help us track that down, please? In order to figure out whether a document refers to one of our witnesses, we need to know the names that go with each Jane Doe number.

Thanks very much,
