Hi team,

I turned the edits suggested by the chiefs. ☐ asked that I get this back to them tomorrow. I am hoping to get it back to them by tomorrow early afternoon so I can turn their next round of edits and send to ☐ to review as soon as possible.

☐ already reviewed the initial draft I sent to the chiefs, but I wanted to make sure you all had an opportunity to review and comment on this before I send this back to the chiefs. I know it is quite lengthy, so apologies in advance.

Thanks,
