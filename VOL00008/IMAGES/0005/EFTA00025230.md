I’m sorry, this coming Tuesday, not Monday.

We just found out yesterday that we’re being sent to Florida for an FBI-arranged meeting with victims in the Epstein case, so again in connection with that investigation (2018R01618), I’d like to please request permission to travel on Monday to Florida and back. Unfortunately because of scheduling I expect I’ll need to fly down and back both on Monday (and back in time to make an afternoon flight to Tennessee for a separate work obligation), but it’s possible [redacted] may need to go if we can’t get the scheduling. In any event, we’re requesting approval for travel for one person for either zero nights or one night, and no need for a conference room for this trip.

thanks very much,

[redacted]
