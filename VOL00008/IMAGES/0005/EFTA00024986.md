Hi all,

If you want to get a production out today (sent on a drive via FedEx to GM), we will need to have it reviewed and ready for me to load by 3:20pm latest (FedEx last pick up is 4pm today).

The TW 3500 production is here: \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Trial\3500\1. Testifying\Production 11

NTW 3500 production is here: \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Trial\3500\2. Non-Testifying\Production 11

Rule 16 production is here: \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Discovery\GM\41 Thirty-Second Production (2021-11-xx)

Cover letters for both and 3500 indices (excel version) are attached. Please let me know as soon as you can if there are any changes you want to make.

Thanks,
