Not a problem, we will get tested tomorrow, we just wanted to check to make sure it was fine that we aren't getting tested closer to flying – given the lag in receiving results, we think tomorrow makes the most sense.

Thanks,

Thanks . I'm so sorry. I have asked but have yet to receive a response. I suspect yes is safer. I hope that is ok. Sorry about this.

Hi Jill,

Following up on our conversation, I was wondering if you had any updates on the testing issue we discussed. Our team is planning to get tested tomorrow in order to make sure we have results before flying, but please let us know as soon as you can if that timing is a problem for some reason.

In addition, my cell phone number and my phone will be working while I'm traveling. I'll also be reachable by email.

Thanks,

Hi Jill,

EFTA00026586

Thank you very much for letting us know. We want to make sure your client is as comfortable as possible. It would be very useful to our investigation to have more members of our team present for the interviews, but we will of course defer to her comfort level. Let's discuss on our call tomorrow and make a final plan for the interviews then.

The process on our end does not require that we be tested before we depart. and I are asymptomatic, have never been symptomatic, and have not come into contact with anyone who was symptomatic or a known carrier, so we have not been tested. That said, if you/your client would like us to get tested before we leave the U.S., there is a clinic near our office that has been able to provide results within a day or two, so we could go there to get tested this week.

Best,

Hi [Redacted]

I spoke to my client over the weekend. I suspect you will get rather more out of her if the number is kept to 2. I think otherwise she may be overwhelmed.

As part of the process at your end will you be taking tests before leaving the US?

Kind Regards,

Jill

Thanks, Jill. A few follow-up questions for you:
First, we are obtaining clearance for four members of our team to travel to London. Those would be [redacted], myself, FBI Special Agent [redacted], and FBI Task Force Office [redacted]. All four of us were on the video call with your client the other day, so she has seen our faces. Please let us know if she is not comfortable with that group, so that we can plan accordingly.
Second, would you like to meet at your offices, or would you like us to look into other arrangements?
Third, would you be available for a call next week in preparation for our trip?
Best,

Hi Jill,

Thanks for letting us know. Do you think you’ll be able to let us know today about the dates we’ve proposed? Apologies for pestering, but we can’t move forward with travel arrangements without them, and the process we’re initiating requires a considerable amount of lead time before traveling once we start it.

Thanks very much,

Thanks very much, Jill. In addition, we have learned that our embassy would be required to notify the Met Police that we are meeting with your client. We wanted to check with you to make sure you are okay with us making that notification, which we are told is standard practice for interviews conducted abroad.

Thanks,

Hi Jill,

With apologies for pressing, I wanted to follow up on these dates. As it turns out, we'll need proposed dates before we can move any further in the approval process. If you could please let us know whether these dates work for you as soon as you can, we'd be very grateful.

Hi Jill,

Thanks very much for taking the time to (virtually) meet with us last week, we very much appreciated the chance to speak with your client. We have been working on seeking approvals for a potential meeting with your client in

EFTA00026590

London in the coming weeks. Although we won't know whether the meeting is ultimately approved until we complete the process, we are working on the issue in the hopes of making this possible.

It would be very helpful to us in the approval process to be able to propose specific dates for a meeting. We would suggest that we set aside three days for successive meetings, if that works. Would you and your client be available for meetings on October 14th, 15th, and 16th? Alternatively, we would propose the 20th, 21st, and 22nd. If you could please let us know your availability, we'd very much appreciate it, and we'll keep you updated when we have more information.

Thanks very much,

| Hi

Thanks very much for reaching out. We would be glad to schedule a videoconference with your client to discuss her questions and concerns. Are there particular dates and times that would work best for you and your client? We are in the process of looking into the current rules on travel for government employees, and will let you know as soon as we have more information. Our team is willing to travel if we are permitted to, but we're not yet certain whether that is possible.

Thank you,

Jill,

We're very gratified to hear that your client is willing to speak with us, and we would be happy to answer her questions as best we can.

In terms of logistics, I recently moved to a new position within our office and so the current team has been updated – the investigation is now being handled by [redacted] and [redacted], whom you've spoken with previously, as well as new addition [redacted], who also has extensive experience in these types of cases—they're all copied here. They'll follow up with you to schedule a time for the discussion, and they can let you know the latest status on any anticipated approvals for Government foreign travel (which I believe currently is prohibited for us, otherwise we would be happy to travel to meet in person).

Thank you very much for your continued assistance in connection with our investigation, and I expect [redacted] and [redacted] will be in touch shortly as well.

thanks again,

From: Jill Greenfield

Hi [redacted]

My client would like to speak to you to discuss matters. This would be in the form of her asking how you would manage this. She did also ask if you were travelling to the UK at any point so. I said not but if I am wrong please do let me know.

Thanks

Jill
