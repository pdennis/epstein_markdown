Thanks very much, [redacted]. In my searches, I'm still seeing the 6:44pm American flight, but looks like it's now landing at 12:25 AM. Do you see that?

If not, is it possible the flight is only available non-refundable? If that's the case, then I suppose we should hold off booking until we have final confirmation on the schedule from our agents.

[redacted], I was in the midst of making your travel reservations, but I'm unable to see the return flight from PNS – LGA departing at 6:44pm on 2/19, arriving at 12:03am on 2/20 that you requested in the attached email below. I assume that it's no longer available.

The latest flight returning to LGA is leaving at 4:06pm, which I assume is too early. The latest return flight time I found that's fully refundable is departing PNS at 5:53pm, arriving in JFK at 1:24am on 2/20/20. Let me know if this flight is okay to book and I'll reserve it ASAP. Thanks.

# 2/19/2020: PNS – JFK (leaving late afternoon / evening)

Hi [Redacted].

Would you please help us book travel to Pensacola, FL and back for next week? I'd like **refundable** tickets for the following flights, please:

- Tuesday 2/18 American Airlines flight from LGA to PNS, departing 5:00 PM, arriving 9:03 PM (layover in DCA)
- Wednesday 2/19 American Airlines flight from PNS to LGA, departing 6:44 PM, arriving 12:03 AM (layover in CLT)

Please make sure the tickets are **refundable** just in case we need to move things around. We are still waiting to hear back from the agents about where exactly we should be staying for the hotel, so we'd like to just book the flights for now, and I'll let you know when we have a more precise location for the hotel.

Thanks very much,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), [Redacted] and I would like to please request permission for the two of us to travel next week for an interview of a witness in Pensacola, Florida on 2/19.

EFTA00025085

We'd plan to fly down on 2/18 and fly back on 2/19. Also, similar to prior requests, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room on 2/19.

Thank you,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th (overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on our formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days at a hotel for the interview itself.

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on that.

thank you,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and or and , but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.
