&gt; Following up on our conversation a few minutes ago, thank you for giving me a call and for your assistance. As discussed, defense counsel has arranged for an individual to join the autopsy; his name is Michael Baden. He is confirmed for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; So you have all my contact info, I'm reachable literally anytime at this email or via cell phone at __________________________
&gt;
&gt; I also expect that defense counsel may email you so you have their contact information as well.
&gt;
&gt; thank you again,

&gt;&gt; I'm one of the prosecutors at the Southern District of New York who has been working on the Jeffrey Epstein case and we have a time sensitive question — with apologies for the Saturday night email, could I please ask you to call me this evening if at all possible? I am reachable any time, including until late tonight. My cell is __________________________

&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,
