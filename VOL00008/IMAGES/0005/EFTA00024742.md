Hi ________________________,

Thanks— this attorney also represents ________________________, who we have wanted to follow up with as well, as soon as we complete discovery. We will reach out to him in early to mid November about both witnesses.

Thanks,

Just met with ________________________ and his daughter. We could not find a good phone number for him but he does not live that far from the city so we knocked on his door. His daughter advised us that his English is not good and she would translate for him. I told him we would just like to speak to him about his former employer over video conference. They acknowledged that they knew I was referring to Epstein. She told us he is currently represented by Aitan Gohlman ________________________ and they prefer all communications go through him. Do you guys wanna take it from here?

I should add: if he prefers to meet in person and you want to do a field interview without us in the first instance, that's fine. Thanks.

He currently lives on Long Island. I can reach out and see if he's willing to chat with us. Would you like to provide us with a subpoena for him?

What do you think of reaching out to _______________________________ for an interview? Happy to discuss next time we speak—can you check to see if he is in the area?

Thanks,
