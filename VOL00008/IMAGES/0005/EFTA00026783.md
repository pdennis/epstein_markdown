Sigrid,

Thank you again for speaking with us this afternoon, we appreciate it. As discussed, we wanted to follow up with you via email about a possible meeting with Ms. ___________—it sounded like it might be convenient to do a meeting next week while you’re in New York, if that would work for her? If so, if you could give us the dates and time ranges that might be possible, we can coordinate on scheduling on our end as well. And of course as always we’re happy to address any questions that you or she might have in advance.

thanks very much,
