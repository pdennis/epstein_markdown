Yes, that sounds about right to me. As I recall, there were not a lot of emails between Epstein and Maxwell, and the majority of the Maxwell emails came from just one of the thumb drives in the New York residence.

When I run the term "gmax" as a search term in the search warrant database, I'm getting only 3,835 hits. That seems low to me. Is that right? I know you're on the road, so no rush, but when you have a chance to check that would be helpful.

Thanks,
