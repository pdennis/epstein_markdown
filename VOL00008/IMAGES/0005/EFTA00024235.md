Counsel,

We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production will be made via USAfx. The materials on USAfx will include additional exhibits. Attached please find the accompanying index.

We will send a CD with the materials to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. If you would prefer that she receive the production on a drive, we can either request that the MDC send us one of the drives back to load with the production, or we can load a new drive if you would like to provide us with one.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
