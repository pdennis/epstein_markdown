Additionally, as you are aware, the Government has seized and extracted data from multiple electronic devices in connection with search warrants executed at Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York and the Virgin Islands. The data from those devices has been subject to a privilege review, based on privileges asserted by Jeffrey Epstein's estate. Because the estate has not waived any of those privileges, the Prosecution Team in this case will not have access to any materials from those devices identified as privileged by the taint review team, and the Government will not produce any such privileged material to the defense in this case.

Further, it is the Government's current understanding that none of the seized devices belonged to the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, and as a result, it is the Government's understanding that the Prosecution Team is not legally permitted to provide you with the full set of non-privileged materials that were extracted from the devices. Instead, the Government anticipates producing only the materials designated responsive to the relevant warrants authorizing the search of these devices. Correspondingly, upon completion of the responsiveness review, the Prosecution Team will only have access to that same set of non-privileged materials deemed responsive to the relevant warrants. The Government expects to produce these responsive, non-privileged materials to you by the November 9, 2020 deadline for completion of discovery.

EFTA00027073

The Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly produce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody.

Very truly yours,

AUDREY STRAUSS
Acting United States Attorney
