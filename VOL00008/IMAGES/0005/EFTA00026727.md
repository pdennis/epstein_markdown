Joe,

It was nice to meet you yesterday, and thanks very much for following up. We appreciate the clarification, and if you have any specific concerns about this topic please let us know, we are happy to discuss, and we appreciate keeping the lines of communication open.

I expect we will reach out later this week to set up a time for a call to discuss next steps, but of course please reach out to us at any time if there's anything you'd like to discuss.

Thanks,

Joe,

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented , prior to his passing in 2018. Agent served with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan's former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.
