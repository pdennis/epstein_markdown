Gary,

Thank you for your email. We are prepared to respond to your questions in full, but before proceeding further, we want to confirm that by “witness statement” you are referring to a live interview (to be conducted in person or via video conference), at which your client will answer our questions and, in advance of which, will produce any documents, including communications, relevant to the subjects to be covered at the interview.

Regards,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York

Subject: Sensitive correspondence.

Dear Ms Comey

The UK Central Authority (UKCA) has informed us that the United States has formally sought assistance in interviewing our client.

The UKCA told us that we would have the opportunity to contact Mr [redacted] from the US Embassy to explore whether, notwithstanding our concerns at the unfair treatment of the Duke by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the failure by the DOJ to abide by its promise to provide an appropriate level of confidentiality to him and us, it would be possible for the Duke to reach an agreement with the DOJ and to provide a voluntary witness statement.

EFTA00023799

Unfortunately, it appears Mr [redacted] has no authority in the matter and has directed us to contact the U.S. case team directly via your email address. With a view to progressing the request for assistance:

[1] Please confirm that any communications between us, with a view to providing the DOJ with a voluntary witness statement from the Duke will be treated confidentially and in particular will not be the subject of DOJ press statements or commentary.

[2] Please provide confirmation (given the reports of connections between the DOJ and US lawyers acting on no win/no fee arrangements) that any voluntary witness statement will not be used for any purpose other than the DOJ's criminal investigations.

[3] We would be grateful if you would confirm the areas of testimony that you would wish the Duke's witness statement to cover.

Kind regards

Gary Bloxsome
