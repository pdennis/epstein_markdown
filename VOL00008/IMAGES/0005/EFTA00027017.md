Yeah we actually already know what it's referring to – DB did an extremely comprehensive presentation to us, and has produced a large amount of documents. The transactions referenced include transfers we've described in both the Epstein and Maxwell filings, among others. We had them run the names of a bunch of people for transfers – see the attached email and its attachment – and they also did a summary chart of his accounts, also attached. And yeah it's Parvin, she's done a really thorough job. I share your view that despite the press coverage, there doesn't appear to have been any malfeasance at all in connection with the Epstein accounts.

Looks like DFS settled with Deutsche Bank yesterday. The press coverage is all about Epstein and the ostensibly "suspicious" transactions they processed for him, but if I'm a betting man, I'm betting the bulk of the resolution is based on the last sentence of the article: "The fine also covered the German bank's connection to a massive money laundering scheme and other improper activity."

Anyway, maybe worth seeing if you can pull the public settlement docs to see what the allegedly suspicious transactions entailed. Or you can go straight to the bank, I suppose. Remind me, does Parvin represent them?
