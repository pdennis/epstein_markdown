Hi

Defense counsel has requested that we schedule an evidence inspection this week with the defendant present. We'd very much appreciate it if the marshals could produce the defendant to a proffer room this week at [redacted]. Our understanding from [redacted], copied here, is that the marshals have been producing defendants for meetings of this type. A CSO and a case agent will be present for the meeting.

Could you please let us know what dates this week would work for the meeting? We are scheduling this with defense attorneys who are flying in from out of state, so would appreciate if you could let us know what dates work this week. Thanks very much,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
