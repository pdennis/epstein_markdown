Subject: Limiting instructions letter

Hey team,

Per the attached order on MV-3, we owe Judge Nathan our views on the proposed limiting instructions. Can we add this to the list for our call? I've written two responsive letters because I'm not sure exactly what she's going for with the second instruction.

Thanks,
