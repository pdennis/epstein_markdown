Dear all,

As **explained**, we are instituting a formal litigation hold in connection with Mr. Epstein’s death at MCC. You have been identified as having done work on or supervised the Epstein matter, and thus as possibly having responsive records. Please note and preserve whatever you have about Mr. Epstein, not limited to his death and to the earlier reported incident in which he suffered physical injuries. In addition, to the extent possible, please avoid altering any relevant records. If you need to use existing documents, please save what you’re working off as a new document so that the version that now exists remains preserved and available.

I attach a formal litigation hold notice, which as required is on an EOUSA-provided form. Please review the notice, fill out the form to indicate whether and where you have responsive records, and sign and return it to me. In particular, be sure to let me know by USAO number if possible what records and share directories we have that are likely to include relevant information.

I prefer scanned and emailed return of the forms, but you can also use interoffice mail if you prefer.

Please let me know if you think other USAO personnel may have relevant documents or evidence.

And please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss.

Finally, I am copying **to** inform him of the new litigation hold, and to ask him to ensure that all responsive information on our electronic record systems is preserved, including by suspending the routine maintenance email deletions for recipients of this email.

Many thanks,
