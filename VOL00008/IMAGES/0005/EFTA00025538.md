Attachments: Application_for_Amended_Warrant_for_3_Drives_from_NY_Residence_v2.docx; Exhibit_A_-_July_11,_2019_Warrant.pdf; Exhibit_B_-_Application_for_June_2020_Warrant.pdf; Exhibit_C_-_June_2020_Warrant.pdf; Exhibit_D_-_Maxwell_Superseding_Indictment_-_S1_20_Cr._330_(AJN)_(docketed).pdf

As discussed earlier today, attached please find a draft affidavit in support of an amended warrant for three of the drives seized from Epstein's NY residence. I'm also attaching the four exhibits referenced in the affidavit.

Please review this closely and let me know if you have any questions or revisions at all. I'll reach out to you on Monday to talk about when it makes sense to schedule a time to swear this out.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
