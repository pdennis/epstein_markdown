If someone is online before our call, would you mind recirculating our letter from last fall where we laid out what we were - and were not - obtaining by way of SDFL materials, and what we planned to do with the [redacted] emails? Thanks

Thanks very much – the team is free at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, so I’ll send around a calendar invitation for then.

I saw that and figured we would need to discuss. Would tomorrow morning work? I am fairly flexible before 12:30.

Could we please schedule a call to discuss this portion of Judge Nathan's opinion (on page 8):

"The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession."

Would it be possible to have a call this weekend?

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
