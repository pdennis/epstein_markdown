Would 3:30 work?

Hi and

Would it be possible to schedule a call to discuss this? We spoke with the civil AUSA on the Radar Online case today, so we have updates on that as well.

Thanks,

Thanks, . On the plus side, it would appear that all of these are recent and pertain (in general terms) to the Epstein investigation we all did and that you are intimately familiar with. Do we have a way of compiling a list of the requests made to Civ Div and handled by them? They must have a FOIA coordinator or something like that...

FYI. [ ]'s list has about sixteen cases. I've asked [REDACTED] to check his records to see if there are more. When we have the full list, [REDACTED] and I will check in with you to see where we should go from here. Two things to note for now:

- One of these FOIA requests is from Boies Schiller, and the log notes that BSF has made multiple requests, including to other districts.
- This list only includes FOIA requests directed to our office. It does not include FOIA lawsuits our civil division has handled, based on FOIA requests to other governmental components (for example, the Radar Online case referenced in Maxwell's letter).

Thanks,

As we just discussed:

Here is what we have in our FOIA tracking database regarding Epstein FOIAs.

And also attached is the letter in PPI about discovery vs FOIA (see p. 8)

Hi Darian,

Hope you're doing well. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. [REDACTED] suggested that you'd be the best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information:

- A list of all FOIA requests our office has received;
- For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and
- Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is.

That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

Thanks very much,
