Subject: Some will question: U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan and Prosecutor's Office

Some will question: How does America judge the degree of underage sex trafficking?

If a wealthy man and/or organization pays for airline tickets, hotel accommodations, and food for underage teens to which results in the underage girls being paraded on stage in nothing more than what is deemed 'not much more than lingerie'... eventually resulting in some of the underage girls possibly having sex with anyone 18+ and/or -18... possibly straight sex and/or lesbian sex, surely the wealthy individual and/or organization is guilty of underage sex trafficking to some degree.

While some will argue such cases are not to the extent of underage sex trafficking such as what unfolded in the case of Jeffrey Epstein -both Lolita Island and U.S. gatherings, the argument of presentation cannot be debated, a degree of sex trafficking occurred during what is considered 'Miss Teen USA Contests.'

There is a grooming involved within beauty pageants, is there not? The payment by a wealthy individual and/or organization offering various teenage girls the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity for sex behind pageant doors' is surely 'a hidden secret' which has taken place, has it not?

Had the underage girls not been offered the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' through the guise of a beauty pageant then, cases of -perhaps most likely, lesbian sex between underage girls would not have been given the time nor, the place for such sex vacations to occur. If such sex vacations occur then, surely it is a form of sex trafficking being set into place... into reality by the wealthy individual and/or pageant organization.

While chains, threats, freedom, etc... is perhaps not a form of physical sex trafficking to which often times associated with sex trafficking, if sex -especially underage sex of any manner at beauty pageant gatherings, occurs then, this sex trafficking has occurred.

Has anyone ever questioned past teen beauty contestants as to how many of them were sexually involved - either with those 18+ and/or -18... with either those within and/or around the pageants... with male or female, during pageant gatherings?</haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk></aliasa1a@hotmail.com>

If indeed any form of sexual involvement occurred then, in fact, sex trafficking occurred under the guise of 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' presented by the beauty pageant owners. A grooming for the world of high-dollar prostitution is what many can potentially perceive beauty pageants and modeling shows to be. NOTE: Obviously, wording of beauty pageants can also be replaced with modeling shows.

Miss Teen beauty pageants have been places of 'underage grooming.'

In order to help ensure Ghislaine Maxwell's day in court -not only for her and her lawyers to defend herself through the legal system, too potentially expose corrupt sex traffickers and, perhaps at this point, to expose the active participants within the deceased Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking saga. Those active participants might very well be high-ranking wealthy politicians and government officials and, socialites typically associated with Hollywood and the wealthy circles throughout America and, the world.

Ghislaine Maxwell's health and well-being should be extremely important to all women -young and old, in order to help ensure injustice is not a continuous practice as in the past while justice is upheld even against those who have thus far been shielded due to political power and/or wealth.

Such is the reason bail should be granted to Ghislaine Maxwell in order to help ensure her appearance before the Court and, before the Nation does not end prior in such an ill-manner of injustice to which befall upon Jeffrey Epstein to which many question the government's ruling of death based upon questioning any cover-up by those in positions of power.

Having an individual alive for justice to be rendered -guilty or innocent within a Court of Law, is a far more demanding form of Law than having an individual confined behind bars -with a great risk of death for silence, until their day in court... perhaps eventually for the political elite if Ghislaine Maxwell is alive and well while finally accepting, her voice must be spoken in truth and honesty... including a forthrightness even at this point in time in order to prevent the freedom of those within political power and wealthy socialite houses to continue abusing their positions of power based upon wealth against young girls and, young women of all ages.

Again, I petition America and, the Courts of Manhattan to grant Ghislaine Maxwell bail for the security of her voice... hopefully her forthright voice to be heard in court.

Plenty of stories have been revealed around media and former contestants, Donny Trump had employees attempting to groom underage girls for him during Miss Teen USA pageants... as have Donny Trump and Billy Clinton connections with Epstein and Maxwell.

Subject: For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan...

For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan to deny Bail Request, denial could potentially place the weight of injustice upon all women -both young and old, if Ghislaine Maxwell becomes another Jeffrey Epstein jail statistic based upon any possibility of any high-ranking politicians/government officials around the world and wealthy socialites seeking her silence.

I encourage both the Prosecutor's Office and the Court to grant Ghislaine Maxwell Bail -based upon stipulations I have noted within previous email [included below], in order for Ghislaine Maxwell to be given the opportunity to take the stand -not only in defense of the charges filed against Ms. Maxwell, also those whom were 'protected' by the death of Jeffrey Epstein.

Jails simply do not provide healthy environments for those Innocent Until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law... especially a Court Case of such magnitude which stands possibly for any and all youth deemed 'underage' by U.S. Law.

Any possibly Flight Risk can be avoided based upon Bail Agreement.

Requesting Bail be granted for the health &amp; well-being of Ghislaine Maxwell in order for Court to be upheld in Truth and Justice.

NOTE: This effort helps ensure Ghislaine Maxwell's safety based upon possible Lolita Island ties to high-ranking Officials... anyone connected with Jeffrey Epstein.

NOTE: Based upon old-school "Innocent until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law."

For Bail Acceptance, based upon me -Greg Hirsch, being without work and, being unable to find any companies interested in my CAEF endeavors, I ask to be employed as one of the Security Guards.

***If property still owned or, similar property, Ghislaine Maxwell pays for twelve RV campers strategically situated around property within 10' chain link fence around premises location at [as shown on Google Maps]:

27 E Washington Road

Bradford, New Hampshire

NOTE: RV campers and 10' chain link fence paid in full and, set in place and, fence erected prior to prisoner/accused released on bail.
