Subject: Maxwell - Telephone Conference Tomorrow
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:17:58 +0000

I know Bobbi Sternheim emailed you earlier about the telephone conference being held by Judge Nathan tomorrow at noon. I just wanted to follow up in case you had any questions and make sure that you have all the information you need. The Court emailed the parties that the phone number for the defendant for tomorrow's conference is [redacted] with access code [redacted]. I'm attaching the Court's order on this, which provides the separate dial-in for members of the press and the public. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much,
