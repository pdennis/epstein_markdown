I've CC'd the forensic accountant Lubin in our squad who will be assisting in this investigation. Let's try and plan a day next week to meet briefly and discuss a game plan. Are you guys around Tuesday to chat?

Andy,

Tomorrow morning could you please burn the following folders to a disc:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY
investigation\Subpoena Returns\American Express

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY
investigation\Subpoena Returns\Deutsche Bank

and put the disc in an envelope addressed to:

Special Agent Amanda Young

Detective

If it's possible to get the disc by 11:30, we'll give the disc to at the conference, or if not, if you could put the envelope with security and reply all that it's ready, they can pick up when convenient.

thanks,
