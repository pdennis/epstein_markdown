That sounds right. Probably not even that long.

Hello.

I am sure will be happy to help in any way she can. Let me find out what her patient schedule is like for next week and find a time that works. How much time do you think she should allot for the interview – just so she can plan?

Best,

Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

We wanted to follow up in connection with [redacted] – our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any questions at all. And if [redacted] is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer.

Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

I checked back with [redacted] and she said that the last entry in her journal is in late February and she went to New Mexico in April.

Thanks

Thank you very much, Sigrid.

Just to confirm, does [redacted] have any journal entries regarding the time when she traveled to New Mexico? I believe she told us during our interview that she does not have any entries from that time, but I just wanted to make sure.

Thanks again,

Hello – attached are the pages [redacted] sent me to provide to you. Here is a bit of an explanation and I also asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need anything else:

“The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY trip and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the movies with him.”

Best,

Thanks very much, Sigrid. Yes, we received the photographs from [REDACTED], which we very much appreciate. Anything else she is willing to share, including her journal entries, would be very helpful.

Hello [REDACTED].

Let me follow up with [REDACTED] about her journal. I know she shared some pictures with you from around the time period when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to you and will check with her to see if she has anything else that might be helpful to the investigation.

All my best,

Sigrid

Subject: [ ] follow-up request

Hi Sigrid,

Hope you had a wonderful holiday season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we made after interviewing [ ] a few months ago. During her interview, [ ] referred to several entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents [ ] may have that relate to her experiences with Epstein and Maxwell.

Would [ ] be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may have) to assist in our investigation?

Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful.

Thank you,

Assistant United States Attorney
