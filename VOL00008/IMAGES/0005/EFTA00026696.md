____, Sunny,

Thank you so much for all of your work on the exhibits. I made some edits directly in the index (saved on the shared and attached here). Some notes below on exhibits and the index. As noted in my prior email, _________________________________________________________ is going to update the index tomorrow morning to indicate which exhibits we intend to offer under seal. She may also have some other comments/edits on exhibits and/or the index in the morning. As always, call or email with any questions. Thank you!!

10Series
- I didn't update the spreadsheet, but I noticed a few things.
- When I look in the folder, as I see it now
- GX-10 – MV2

EFTA00026696

- GX-11 – MV6
- GX-12 – MV1
- GX-13 – MV4

- GX 10 isn’t listed in the spreadsheet.
- Remove MV-5 entry for now from index; when we get the certificate we will update

## 300 series

- Remove GXs 316 and 331 and move up the last exhibits in the series to fill the gap
- GX 313 – photo of GM including nudity (just making sure you see for redacting). Please cut “(nude)” from the description in the index, please. Add the appropriate asterisk.

## 400 series

- Do the word documents in native form (417A through 422A) have the old metadata?. Just want to be sure of this and asking because I see that it might be different based on properties when I looked
- There is no GX 419. Can you please fill the gap? Or shift things up? Sorry about that!
