Following up on the below from the week before last, the attorneys had hoped to set up a meeting for sometime later this week or next. Can I relay an answer about whether [REDACTED] is willing to meet with them?

thanks,

[REDACTED]

In our call today with counsel for the respective Trustees of the Epstein estate, they asked that we convey a request to meet with [REDACTED], and anyone else she would want to include in such a meeting, to discuss the Trustees' interest in resolving the Government's potential civil forfeiture claims against the estate. They said they appreciated our (the line assistants') willingness to hear their regular updates, but that they understand we're not in a position to negotiate, or even to provide feedback on the proposed plan for the fund, and so they'd like the opportunity to elevate that discussion and convey why they believe it would be in all parties' interests, including the victims, to engage in meaningful discussions about a possible resolution. When you've spoken with [REDACTED], could you please let us know whether she's willing to meet with them? And we can convey the response, unless you and/or she would prefer to do so directly. If she is willing to meet with them, they were hoping to put a date and time on the calendar as soon as is convenient for her after the holiday.

thanks,

[REDACTED]

Assistant U.S. Attorney
