Dear Judge Parker,

Attached for the Court’s consideration, please find an amended application and amended affidavit in support of a second warrant and order. As detailed in the amended application and amended affidavit, this afternoon, [redacted] realized that she had inadvertently included two errors in the affidavit submitted to Your Honor yesterday. Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits these amended materials and requests the issuance of a second warrant and order.

If at all possible, we would be extremely grateful if the agent could please swear out this warrant today. I can be reached at [redacted], and the agent can be available at any time convenient for the Court. We apologize for the error and the inconvenience.

Respectfully submitted,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
