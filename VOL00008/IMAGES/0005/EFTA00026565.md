I think that because it discusses suicidality, it's tangentially related to the case and we should produce it, but I don't think there's any basis to get and produce the other Epstein files. Do you guys have a different view?

I think we haven't produced it previously, as removed everything that we had already produced. While I don't see a harm in producing this 302, I wonder if it opens us up to having to produce more of the Epstein case file or whether we can rationally limit it since it discusses suicidality. Thoughts?

I've never seen those notes before and it's not my handwriting – they came from MCC? Maybe they are Lt. ? I would check with on that to make sure it's not her handwriting.

I remember seeing this 302, but I don't remember where – I don't have a memory of producing it, but I could be wrong. (should be able to tell if we produced it previously). and I never had access to the Epstein shared and never got or produced the underlying case files.

In reviewing additional documents for the latest MCC discovery production, I found these notes of an interview labeled "Unknown." Any idea who this might be? Also, FBI provided us with a supplemental 302 about Epstein's arrest. Do you know if we produced the original 302 about Epstein's arrest?

Thanks!
