Thanks for letting us know. And sorry you have to receive these emails. I think this is certainly better handled by the court than us as we have no control over these issues. Since _________________________________________________________________________ was copied I’m sure she is handling up her chain. Does anyone have any other thoughts? Happy to discuss if you’d like.

Good evening-

You failed to provide any update concerning the whereabouts of Ms. Maxwell’s legal mail that I had placed in the legal mailbox on 10/2.

However, on Friday afternoon, I was informed by Ms. Maxwell and Unit Manager _________________________________________________________________________ that the envelope had been located and affixed to it

was a bar-code type sticker, not generated by the MDC, but of the type issued by the U.S. Post Office.

I had placed the envelope in the legal mailbox. It did not have postage. If, for some questionable reason, it had been handled by the U.S. Postal Service

(which is highly unlikely and, if so, deliberately caused by the MDC), the Post Office would have returned it to my office address (at the return address on the envelope),

not deliver it to the MDC without postage.

This suggests some type of foul play on the part of the MDC, or at least some type of cover-up.

I am informed that the Warden is aware of this. Today, I received the envelope from Unit Manager _________________________________________________________________________.

Today, Christian Everdell, Esq. and I had a scheduled legal visit with Ms. Maxwell.

Rather than permitting us to use a somewhat larger room, we were required to use a room for two.

This completely defeated the purpose of COVID protective measures. The plastic partition did not shield

Mr. Everdell and there was little or no table surface for him to use. The room was unnecessarily cramped

when a larger room was available. My request to use a larger room was denied. The officer claimed the team could not position the camera

to focus on the larger room. This response was bogus. I requested to see the Warden, but that request was never honored.

Further, defense counsel at large have heard about the current electricity issues affecting water, toilet flushing, and meals.

Ms. Maxwell received a bologna sandwich despite being on no-flesh (vegetarian) diet.

This is yet another blunder on the part of the MDC which needs to be immediately corrected.

I will not waste my energy requesting a response because even if forthcoming it will likely be insufficient.

These matters will be brought to the Court's attention, so you can start preparing excuses for consideration by Judge Nathan.

Enjoy your holiday.

Good afternoon-

Ms. Maxwell still has not received the legal mail (a properly addressed manila envelope) that I deposited in the East Building legal mailbox on Saturday 10/2 shortly after 3 pm while I was escorted to the lobby by a male guard.

Please contact me immediately.

Thank you-

I will follow up with the appropriate departments.

Good evening-

As of this writing, Ms. Maxwell has not received legal mail which I personally placed in the
East Building legal mailbox on Saturday, October 2. On that same day, in that same mailbox,
I deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building. That client confirmed that he received his legal mail.

Ms. Maxwell has not.

Please explain why delivery of Ms. Maxwell's mail has been delayed.

Time is of the essence. Her trial begins on November 29th.

Every delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare for trial.

Your prompt response is requested.

Thank you-
