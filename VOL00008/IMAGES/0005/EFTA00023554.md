Hi _______________.

I hope you are doing well. We spoke about a year ago regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, and I am reaching back out now to request assistance in the discovery process for my office's related prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. Would your office be willing to share with us a copy of its files relating to your prior investigation and prosecution of Epstein?

I'm happy to have a call to discuss further, and please let me know if there is someone else in your office I should speak with regarding this request. I can be reached any time on my cellphone at _______________.

Thank you very much for your help.

Best,
