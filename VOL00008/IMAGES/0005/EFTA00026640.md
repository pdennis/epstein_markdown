Hi all,

How does 2:45 or 3 sound? Would tomorrow be better? Time got away from me playing catch-up on all I missed last week.

Thank you,

Hi

Good afternoon,

EFTA00026641

As I think you all know Nick has been placed in SHU based on an allegation that he was in possession of a cell phone. If true, I understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order.

Leaving that aside I want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of Wednesday, he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally nothing to read, listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the accompanying batteries.

Most troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been returned to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive work product that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to prepare for our next meeting. When I saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the documents he was working with when he was taken from the cell. I am very concerned that these documents have been seized by the staff at MCC. Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him immediately.

Lastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward.
