Thanks, team. How can I pitch in? I'm attaching the letter we sent defense counsel last month in Maxwell re: a bill of particulars. Also happy to do additional research on the accountant issue—just let me know how I can be useful.

Yes, I am aiming to get you a draft of the opposition at some point this weekend. Would be grateful for you to handle the other items. Thanks.

Hey – What's the plan on this motion? If you were planning on working on it, Rob, I can tackle the BOP/Brady letters and the accountant privilege letter.
