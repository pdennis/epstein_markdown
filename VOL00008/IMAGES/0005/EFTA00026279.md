Under penalty of perjury, I declare that I have examined the information on my 2015 New York State electronic personal income tax return, including any accompanying schedules, attachments, and statements, and certify that my electronic return is true, correct, and complete. The ERO has my consent to send my 2015 New York State electronic return to New York State through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In addition, by using a computer system and software to prepare and transmit my form electronically, I consent to the disclosure to New York State of all information pertaining to the transmission of my tax form electronically. I understand that by executing this Form TR-579-IT, I am authorizing the ERO to sign and file this return on my behalf and agree that the ERO's submission of my personal income tax return to the IRS, together with this authorization, will serve as the electronic signature for the return and any authorized payment transaction. If I am paying my New York State personal income taxes due by electronic funds withdrawal, I authorize the New York State Tax Department and its designated financial agents to initiate an electronic funds withdrawal from the financial institution account indicated on my 2015 electronic return, and I authorize my financial institution to withdraw the amount from my account. As New York does not support International ACH Transactions (IAT), I attest the source for these funds is within the United States. I understand and agree that I may revoke this authorization for payment only by contacting the Tax Department no later than five (5) business days prior to the payment date.

Department of Taxation and Finance
Application for Automatic Six-Month Extension of Time to File for Individuals (with instructions)
IT-370
568301 09-16-15

# Instructions

## New for 2015

Self-employed individuals engaging in business within the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) must now submit their application for automatic six-month extension of time to file, along with any required payment for metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax (MCTMT), using Form IT-370 rather than Form MTA-7, Application for Automatic Six-Month Extension of Time To File a Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax Return. Form MTA-7 is obsolete.

## General information

### Purpose

File Form IT-370 on or before the due date of the return to get an automatic six-month extension of time to file Form IT-201, Resident Income Tax Return, or Form IT-203, Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return.

**Note:** We no longer accept a copy of the federal extension form in place of Form IT-370.

If you are requesting an extension of time to file using Form IT-370, you may still file Form IT-201 or Form IT-203 electronically, provided you meet the conditions for electronic filing as listed in the instructions for the forms.

If you have to file Form Y-203, Yonkers Nonresident Earnings Tax Return, the time to file is automatically extended when you file Form IT-370. For more information on who is required to file Form Y-203, see the instructions for the form.

We cannot grant an extension of time to file for more than six months if you live in the United States. However, you may qualify for an extension of time to file beyond six months under section 157.3(b)(1) of the personal income tax regulations because you are outside the United States and Puerto Rico, or you intend to claim nonresident status under section 605(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Tax Law (548 day rule), as explained in the instructions for Form IT-203 under Additional information. Also see the special condition code instructions for the return you will be filing (Form IT-201 or Form IT-203).

## When to file

File one completed Form IT-370 on or before the filing deadline for your return (extension applications filed after the filing deadline for the return are invalid). Generally, the filing deadline is the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of your tax year (April 18, 2016, for calendar-year filers).

However, you may file Form IT-370 on or before:

- June 15, 2016, if you qualify for an automatic two-month extension of time to file your federal and New York State income tax returns because you are out of the country (for additional information, see When to file/important dates on the back cover of the instructions for the return you are filing) and you need an additional four months to file (October 17, 2016);
- June 15, 2016, if you are a U.S. nonresident alien for federal income tax purposes and you qualify to file your federal and New York State income tax returns on June 15, 2016, and you need an additional six months to file (December 15, 2016); or
- July 14, 2016, (if your due date is April 18, 2016) or September 13, 2016 (if you are a nonresident alien and your due date is June 15, 2016), if you qualify for a 90-day extension of time to file because your spouse died within 30 days before your return due date and you need additional time to file. However, you must file your return on or before October 17, 2016, if your due date is April 18, 2016, or on or before December 15, 2016, if you are a nonresident alien and your due date is June 15, 2016.

See Special condition codes on page 2.

If you qualify for an extension of time to file beyond six months, you must file Form IT-370 on or before the filing deadline for your return.

## How to file

Complete Form IT-370 and file it, along with payment for any tax due, on or before the due date of your return. Use the worksheet on page 3 to determine if a payment is required.

568302 09-16-15

Spouses who file separate returns must complete separate Forms IT-370. Do not include your spouse's SSN or name on your separate Form IT-370.

Payment of tax - To obtain an extension of time to file, you must make full payment of the properly estimated tax balances due. Payment may be made by check or money order. See Payment options below.

## Penalties

Late payment penalty - If you do not pay your tax liability when due (determined with regard to any extension of time to pay), you will have to pay a penalty of 1/2 of 1% of the unpaid amount for each month or part of a month it is not paid, up to a maximum of 25%. The penalty will not be charged if you can show reasonable cause for paying late. This penalty is in addition to the interest charged for late payments.

Reasonable cause will be presumed with respect to the addition to tax for late payment of tax if the requirements relating to extensions of time to file have been complied with, the balance due shown on the income tax return, reduced by any sales or use tax that is owed, is no greater than 10% of the total New York State, New York City, Yonkers, and MCTMT tax shown on the income tax return, and the balance due shown on the income tax return is paid with the return.

Late filing penalty - If you do not file your Form IT-201 or Form IT-203 when due (determined with regard to any extension of time to file), or if you do not file Form IT-370 on time and obtain an extension of time to file, you will have to pay a penalty of 5% of the tax due for each month, or part of a month, the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. However, if your return is not filed within 60 days of the time prescribed for filing a return (including extensions), this penalty will not be less than the lesser of $100 or 100% of the amount required to be shown as tax due on the return reduced by any tax paid and by any credit that may be claimed. The penalty will not be charged if you can show reasonable cause for filing late.

## Interest

Interest will be charged on income tax, MCTMT, or sales or use tax that is not paid on or before the due date of your return, even if you received an extension of time to file your return. Interest is a charge for the use of money and in most cases may not be waived. Interest is compounded daily and the rate is adjusted quarterly.

## Fee for payments returned by banks

The law allows the Tax Department to charge a $50 fee when a check, money order, or electronic payment is returned by a bank for nonpayment. However, if an electronic payment is returned as a result of an error by the bank or the department, the department won't charge the fee. If your payment is returned, we will send a separate bill for $50 for each return or other tax document associated with the returned payment.

## Privacy notification

See our Web site or Publication 54, Privacy Notification.

## Specific instructions

Name and address box - Enter your name (both names if filing a joint application), address and social security number(s). Failure to provide a social security number may invalidate this extension. If you do not have a social security number, enter do not have one. If you do not have a social security number, but have applied for one, enter applied for.

Foreign addresses - Enter the information in the following order: city, province or state, and then country (all in the City, village, or post office box). Follow the country's practice for entering the postal code. Do not abbreviate the country name.

Special condition codes - If you are out of the country and need an additional four months to file (October 17, 2016), enter special condition code E3. If you are a nonresident alien and your filing due date is June 15, 2016, and you need an additional six months to file (December 15, 2016), enter special condition code E4. If you qualified for a 90-day extension of time to file because your spouse died, and you need additional time to file (on or before October 17, 2016, or in the case of a nonresident alien, on or before December 15, 2016), enter special condition code D9. Also enter the applicable special condition code, E3, E4, or D9 on Form IT-201 or Form IT-203 when you file your return.

▼ Detach (cut) here ▼ Do not submit with your return.
