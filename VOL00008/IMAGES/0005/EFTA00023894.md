Hey [redacted],

As you may have seen, on Friday, Judge Nathan denied all of Maxwell’s supplemental motions. (She also denied an ex parte motion for some Rule 17 subpoenas, so it seems like our earlier motion was effective.)

Judge Nathan’s order, however, says that we did not object to providing the defense with the identities of Maxwell’s uncharged co-conspirators, and she presumes we intend to do so.

We’ve drafted the attached letter explaining that we do not, in fact, intend to do so. For convenience, Judge Nathan’s opinion is attached, and the relevant passage is footnote 1 on page 12.

Thanks,
Andrew
