Special Agent

I was the chief of the Palm Beach Police Department during the entirety of its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. I obtained your contact information from [redacted] of the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility.

I understand that you are the case agent for the New York Field Office in the Jeffery Epstein case and subsequent investigation of coconspirators now that Epstein is dead. Please call me at [redacted] as I believe that I am in possession of information that is germane to your investigation that you may not otherwise be aware and I feel compelled to pass to you or someone at the FBI who is working on this case.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Global Security Advisors
