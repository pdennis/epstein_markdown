Hi [Redacted],

I'm out of the Palm Beach RA. I think we've spoken in the past, but I got your email from [Redacted] on my squad.

Reaching out tonight on behalf of SA [Redacted] (Atlanta Division, and cc'd here) who was hoping to get your team some information. [Redacted] is the WMD Coordinator for Atlanta and has an FAA Contact that just provided

Atlanta with some information on Epstein's black Jet Stream, which is sitting at ATL. reached out to us to inquire where to send these documents.

Would you kindly advise? Happy to e-introduce you guys. Please let me know if I can help out further in any way. Thanks.

Best,

Palm Beach County RA
