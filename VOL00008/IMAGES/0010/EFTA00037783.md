Thanks Mandy.

It looks like the subscriber records for the [redacted] number start in November 2005, and the messages we looked at with the [redacted] number are from October 2005. Looking at the [redacted] tolls, those start in '04.

Could you please let me know who the service provider was in 10/05? Thanks.
