Importance: Normal

The guy's name is  number is  mothers name is

So, he tells me he and his mother have been kidnapped several times and brought across state lines because he is the son of a hitman/drug dealer.

He did not know that Jeffrey Epstein was one of the men in the group that ordered the kidnapping of him and his mother until he saw his picture in the paper. He was tortured by this group and he recognized the face in the paper as one of the people that ordered the kidnapping and watched with his very affluent group torture him and his mother and kill his attorney.

He has reported the kidnapping several times to SA  in Orange County California.

Sorry I have to send you the phone calls I get.
