The following was expressed during my SHU reviews today.

- I tier believes they are being treated unfairly.
- Alimeheti #77704-054 indicated he was given a stress ball by psychology but Lt said he could not have it.
- Several inmates stated their cells were moved and they did not get all their property.
- Inmates are upset they have not been getting showers or recreation.

Thank you.
