No, this is being handled by our Crimes against Children squad (C20). I've copied the SSA,

I just emailed you on the red side and realized you're probably headed out for the day. The short story is I work in Phoenix and received a call from a detective who I used to work with. Apparently a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, who has apparently been to the island as a teenager several times, would like to disclose for the first time. The detective is looking for guidance. Is this case being worked on your squad? How would you recommend I guide the detective? Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
