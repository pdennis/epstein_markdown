Hi _____________________________.

Thanks for letting us know, and sorry if there were any issues there. Attached are some of the records sent us. Are you able to tell who owns the building at 116 E. 65th Street?

Thanks!

Hey guys,

Just a heads up when your liaison runs Maxwell though the TECS system we get a notification email that someone at JFK is running her. Just please give us a heads up if your having someone else run her name so there's no confusion that she may be leaving the country or there is some other investigation going on. Her name has hit 3 times in the past month on TECS.

Thanks!

No problem, we will start working on what we can today. I've CC'd [REDACTED] for assistance with some of these requests.

[REDACTED], would you be able to give us a hand with items 2-3 on this list as requested by the AUSA's. I've performed an updated Accurint check on Maxwell search for any properties she owns with negative results. Hoping maybe you can come up with something in your searches. Thanks!

Hi [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].

In connection with the Maxwell investigation, I know this is a travel week, but if at all possible, are you able to assist with the following? It would be great to get some of these in motion this week:

1) Are you able to spend some time reviewing the message pads seized from Epstein's residence, to search for any messages left by (or regarding) any of the individuals relating to the GM case? In particular, it would be helpful to know if there are messages relating to: [REDACTED]

2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to request additional financial information, but it would be helpful to have a snapshot of what we already know about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be helpful.

3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns?

4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check through the leads regarding Maxwell.

5) I think we emailed about this last month, but can you let us know how you know that she has UK and French citizenship?

6) Could you please send us the notes from the [REDACTED] interview?

Thanks in advance, and sorry to pile on, I know everyone is busy.
