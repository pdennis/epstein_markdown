As of today approximately 6:15 AM Electronic Technician  informed me that here at MCC NY we have a total of 161 cameras. At this time we are recording on the new system 141 - 146 cameras we need to work on 15 -20 cameras to get them operational, approximately at this time we have 110 cameras labeled correctly at the recorder. Tomorrow  from  and  will be finishing what they can and testing the system on generator power. From this day forward Monday - Friday days any Electronic Technician or Telecommunication Specialist is here at MCC NY I will be getting an update on camera outages which I will forward to my AW and Warden. Any questions please let me know.
