On August 14, 2019 approximately 1:30pm I was notified by the visiting staff. That a visitor of inmate [Redacted] possibly had contraband on her to pass to the inmate. When I arrived in the lobby area of the institution I asked the visitor who was identified as [Redacted] if she had any intentions on giving inmate [Redacted] anything prohibited she stated " Yes it's wrap up, I don't know what it is but I can take it out ". I then ask for female staff to take her in a private area so she could forfeit the items. 3 bundles wrapped in electric tape containing a cellphone, tobacco, pills, marijuana, rolling papers and other contraband was recovered.
