All Staff,

Due to the heightened media presence this shall serve as a reminder that any and all media inquiries should be referred to my self. During my absence please direct them to Alt PIO Mr. at Ext.

Please do not engage and or response to any media inquiries either in person or via phone. If you should have any questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

I would like to personally thank the staff working this past weekend as most of you have screened and encountered many calls/request for information and maintained their professionalism at all times.

Thank you for your continued support
