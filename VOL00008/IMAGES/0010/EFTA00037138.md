# CLIENT VERIFICATION AND CONSENT

I have read the Overview of the Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement and the Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement, and I understand the potential risks and advantages of joint representation of my case with similar claims against one or more of the same defendants. I have either reviewed the Overview of the Joint Representation and Prosecution and the Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement with independent counsel or I have chosen not to do so. I seek to retain the Marsh Law Firm as my attorneys. I consent to their joint representation of me and others with similar claims against one or more of the same defendants, I consent to their joint prosecution of my case and the cases of others with similar claims against one or more of the same defendants, and I waive any potential conflict of interest that could arise from such joint representation or joint prosecution.
