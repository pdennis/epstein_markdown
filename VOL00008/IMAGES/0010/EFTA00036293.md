We are currently extremely understaffed in our psychology department and are therefore covering both clinical and forensic studies. We also have a very high caseload of forensic studies at this time. Additionally, I have a medical procedure coming up in August and am trying to get all of my forensic cases done prior to being out. For all of the above reasons, I requested the 15-day extension in order to complete a thorough and comprehensive evaluation. Attached is a copy of the letter I sent the Judge, with the Warden's signature on the final copy.
