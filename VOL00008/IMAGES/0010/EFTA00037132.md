Dear Miss

## Renunciation of British Citizenship

I am writing to inform you that the above named is now registered as having renounced British Citizenship.

Enclosed is the Declaration of renunciation bearing a stamp of registration. This confirms the date on which the applicant ceased to be a British Citizen, under Section 12(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981.

Any British travel documents that you may still hold should be returned to:

Her Majesty's Passport Office
Globe House
London, SW1V 1PN

Renunciation of British nationality affects a person's right to live in the UK. If you live in the UK, you should contact us as soon as possible for information on how you are affected by your renunciation of British nationality and what steps you must take to confirm your immigration status. Details of how to contact us can be found on our website at www.gov.uk/uk-visas-immigration
