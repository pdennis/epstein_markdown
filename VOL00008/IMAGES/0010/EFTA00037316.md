The case agent made arrangements to have them shipped to NY. He's currently checking on the status.

Ok no problem. I've reached out to the SSA in West Palm Beach. I'm waiting on a call back. I'll follow up with her if I don't hear back. I'll let you know as soon as I have the info.

As you can see SDNY is anxious for an answer regarding the case files, can you please get me the status on these files asap. Where are they, what are they (how many volumes, boxes, etc.) and when will they be sent to NY? I will discuss with the ASAC about the plan moving forward with the scanning.
Thanks,

Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them available for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. Our understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the case team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession of [redacted]). So I'm not sure what still needs to be located?

And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs to know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to whoever we need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us (or even directly to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the materials arrive.

We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors to have it resolved.

Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they should call)? And thanks again for your help.

Thanks [redacted] we are still trying to locate the files and determine a time frame on the delivery. I'm discussing the situation with my ASAC and FBI legal, i don't think they're opposed to your idea but right now they don't want the files going direct to the USAO. we'll probably need to get the files here, see what we have and hopefully everyone will be amenable to the third party scanning as discussed. We'll touch base after the holiday.

Wanted to quickly follow up on this to see if there's any update on status (both in terms of whether the documents are en route, and also the prospects for our office managing the vendor process)? Please let us know when you have a chance? And if anything else from us would be helpful, we're happy to do whatever we can to get the gears turning.

thanks again,

Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it’s a number of cases so hopefully that’s helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they’ve been scanned.

The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we’ve used outside vendors, including for original and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.):

U.S. v. Chambers, 1997
U.S. v. Adelglass, 1997
U.S. v. Ng Lap Sen, 1997
U.S. v. Tortora, org, 1997
U.S. v. Ashraf Hassab, 1997
U.S. v. Goldbrener, 1997
U.S. v. Vargas, hea, 1997
U.S. v. Krupkin, do, 1997
U.S. v. Cruz, overd, 1997

In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to continue to get work with us). I’m not aware of any instances where that has been a problem.

Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we’re also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week.

Thanks again.
