&amp; Co, thanks for this. One question on the attached MCC sign up sheet for OT. Are the names on the sheet the final list of people who asked for a shift and received it? Or is this everyone who asked, and some got the shifts and some did not? Just want to know what I'm looking at. Thk

info for questions 8-10:

After review of the overtime logs for mandatory overtimes vs. volunteer overtimes during the week of August 4-10, 2019, the numbers are as follows:

8/4 (22 total overtimes, 4 augmentations - of the 22, 1 was mandated)
8/5 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 1 was mandated)
8/6 (29 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 29, 4 were mandated)
8/7 (27 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 27, 2 were mandated)
8/8 (36 total overtimes, 2 augmentations - of the 36, 4 were mandated)
8/9 (30 total overtimes, 3 augmentations - of the 30, 1 was mandated)
8/10 (38 total overtimes, 1 augment - of the 38, 2 were mandated)

Staff at MCC sign up for overtime utilizing the overtime program. Custody staff are utilized first, then non-custody staff. Once the sign up roster has been exhausted and there are still vacancies to fill, there is an email to all staff and an all-call via the radio system requesting volunteers. If there are still vacancies, mandates are utilized on the evening and morning shifts. During the day shift, augmentation is utilized.

Attached are the sign up logs beginning on 7/14/19 and ending on 8/13/19.

1. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual Current On-Board employee numbers for MCC New York? Also, can you provide snapshots of MCC auth vs. onboard staff for past three years (quarterly snapshots fine).
2. What are the Actual Authorized and Actual On-Board Correctional Officer numbers for MCC New York? Pls provide Correctional Officer count by PP last three FYs.
3. What is regular entry level grade and salary (with locality) of a entry level CO at the MCC?
4. Pls provide MCC Inmate count weekly for past 5 years (fiscal or calendar, your choice). Or, if weekly isn't convenient, whatever your standard reporting is will be OK. 3 years OK if you don't have 5 quickly.
5. What was the normal staff count supposed to be for Friday 8/9 night shift and overnight shift into Saturday 8/10? What was the actual staff count for those two shifts?
6. What 3R bonuses are being offered at MCC NY? How many staff have received them the past two FYs? How many current staff have received 3R bonuses?
7. This FY or last FY, did MCC New York request additional Correctional Officer positions or total positions from the Region and/or CO BOP, and if so, were they provided?
8. Does MCC New York generally use augmentation or overtime to address staffing shortages? We assume both. Does BOP have a rough breakdown of the usual split between the two?

9. Do you track mandatory vs. voluntary OT at MCC NY? If so, pls provide breakout of usage by PP this FY or readily available time period. (Is voluntary OT vs. mandatory OT coded differently in NFC? If so, we can run rpt here). If you need to ask the MCC for a breakout, skip this.

10. Does MCC use the traditional BOP "bid sheet" (or whatever the BOP term is) process whereby staff can sign up in advance for OT shifts? If so, do you save? Can you provide YTD data on how much requested OT has been used vs. total OT?

Pls answer what you can from Central Office, no intention of adding to work at MCC. Just let me know if you can't answer something because you'd have to ask the MCC. Thks
