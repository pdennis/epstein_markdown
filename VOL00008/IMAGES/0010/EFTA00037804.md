This was from a while back, but wanted to follow up on the question of physical evidence. I've reviewed the list (I thought it was really difficult to read, so I reformatted it significantly, though without any substantive changes – see attached) and I think the answer is we should have everything transferred up here with the exception of extremely large items.

Specifically, I think at this stage we do not need to be housing the following:

1B2 – 31: Green massage table
1B2 – 43: Peach massage table
1B1 – 6: Beige massage table
1B1 – 7: Brown massage table

Also, for some of the entries there are numbers next to the descriptions in parentheses. For most of those, it looks like either the number of the type of thing or just a repeat of the sub-number of the various item numbers in the first column. For item number 1B2, a bunch of the entries have numbers (following the descriptions) that don't seem to be either of those things. Is there any significance to those numbers?? I just want to make sure there are no issues with our records of what exists.

Let us know if any questions or issues – and obviously anybody please say the word if you disagree about holding off on bringing up the massage tables – and thanks.
