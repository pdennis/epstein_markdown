Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC. I've seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

If the Bureau is added, the following is proposed:

The Bureau of Prisons also temporarily reassigned the Bureau pending the outcome of the investigation.

While I prefer not to state the Bureau’s name in this release, if you decide it needs to be added, his name is
