Per your request, I have prepared an analysis of the account numbers included in the AMEX production regarding Maxwell. The attached draft analysis is to be used for discussion purposes only and is subject to change.

While there are quite a few account number changes, the production includes three account relationships. Please note that despite the fact that the account numbers change, they are in same account.

1. ELLMAX LLC/GMAXWELL - The last statement for this account is September 2016.
2. G MAXWELL - This is her current account (last six digits are __________).
3. THEODORE W WAITT - Maxwell had a sub account under this relationship. The September 2010 is the last statement in which Maxwell is included in the account.

If you have any question, please contact me.
