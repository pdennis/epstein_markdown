I understand what the policy says but was the trip more than 12 hours? Thanks.

Ma'am

Both fall under this category that's why travel authorizations were created for both staff.

Thanks

GSA FTR 301-11.1 allows per diem when the trip is over 12 hours.

The travel must be over 50 miles and over 12 hours to get per diem.

If you have any other questions, please let us know.

Thanks.

Good afternoon,

I have a travel related question,

If a staff member is assigned as an escort staff and this trip is over the 50 mile radius and goes over 12 hours all together. Is he/she entitled to per diem "75%" on travel days?

Sincerely,
