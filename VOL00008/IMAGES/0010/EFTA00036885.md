Good morning

You don't know me, but I have some idea of what you are going through right now as the Exec and PIO. I was the PIO at _________________________ was killed, so trust me when I say, I have a good idea of what you are going through when dealing with the media and union during this difficult situation and the information that is being shared. Stay strong!!
