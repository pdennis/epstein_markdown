Good afternoon,

I've attached an inspection record for Kevin Maxwell as reference. His last listed flight (2/29/2020) was INBOUND to Boston, however he is listed as not being on board. His last 5 flights have also been listed as not being on board. Based on the inspection record being dated on 3/16/2020 it is unclear if he is in the US currently. It was noted regarding COVID-19 he has a "travel history with a nexus to Great Britain". The document does not specify if he was in the US trying to leave or trying to come to the US again in March.

Thanks,

Kimberly
