# HILLARY M. NAPPI, ESQ.

Hillary M. Nappi is a Partner at Hach Rose Schirripa &amp; Cheverie LLP and practices in complex civil litigation. Ms. Nappi has been selected by Super Lawyers as Metro Rising Star in civil litigation from 2018 through 2022.

Ms. Nappi leads the firm's Victims' Rights practice group and provides a trauma-informed approach to all of our clients. She is litigating hundreds of cases on behalf of survivors of sexual abuse and assault against several institutions – both public and private – in the wake of the passage of New York and New Jersey's revival statutes allowing once time-barred claims to be heard. Ms. Nappi has successfully resolved these sexual abuse cases prior to trial, resulting in millions of dollars in recovery for survivors. Ms. Nappi is also representing plaintiffs across the county in §1983 actions and has secured recoveries as a result of their discrimination.

Prior to joining the Firm, Ms. Nappi spent nine years working at the law offices of Boies Schiller &amp; Flexner LLP. While in law school, Ms. Nappi worked as a legal assistant/paralegal to the firm's Chairman, David Boies. After her admission to the bar, Ms. Nappi was promoted to Staff Attorney. As a Staff Attorney, Ms. Nappi was on the trial team assigned to work on Starr International v. The United States, No. 1:11-cv-00779-TCW. At the time, the case was the largest ever filed against the United States Government, alleging that the Government's acquisition of AIG equity and subsequent actions relating to a reverse stock split were unlawful.
