I hope all is good in NY.

Please see attached document provided by NCA. Additionally, please advise whether any internal NSPCC investigation into Clare Iveagh would adversely affect your investigation.

Also, NCA has some financial intelligence regarding Epstein's . NCA believes FBINY might already be aware of this information as it is a U.S. bank account, but if this would be of interest, NCA can route to you via FinCEN.

Please let us know how we can coordinate with NCA on your behalf.

Thanks,
