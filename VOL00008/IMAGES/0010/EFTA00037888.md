Hello Downstater. See below for a message from a co-chair of the coalition regarding a march for the CVA on 9/28, a female adult sexual assault group announcement from CVTC, and a job posting from the Justice Center.

Dear Downstate Coalition Members:

I hope you are well and are enjoying the last weeks of summer. I am writing to invite you to join Safe Horizon for a march up Fifth Avenue on September 28th to raise awareness about the Child Victims Act and to support survivors. Since launching our PSA campaign in Times Square last week to highlight the beginning of the one year "window" on August 14th that allows older survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file retrospective civil lawsuits, we have seen a spike in interest and energy around the issue. Our plan is to channel that energy and also reach more survivors and family members who might be looking for community and resources. The march will take place on Saturday, September 28th (we are still finalizing the start time for the march) and will proceed up Fifth Avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral (between 50th &amp; 51st street) to Jeffrey Epstein's former home on E. 77th Street.

Please let me know if you and/or colleagues are interested in joining us on Sept. 28th. It would be great if you could also spread the word about the event with your supporters.

Thanks so much, and please let me know if you have any questions or would like more information about the Child Victims Act, the look-back window, or anything else. You can reach me at @safehorizon.org

With best wishes,

EFTA00037888
