- Establishment of goals
- Risk assessment
- Determination of operational and procedural definitions
- Evaluation of existing communications networks and other related technology
- Equipment and systems selection
- Engineering and procurement

- Training
- Test and turnover
- Long term maintenance

In developing assessments, designs and proposals SIGNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC. follows the above guidelines to ensure that a system will operate according to requirements and within budget. Included in our design process is a check and balance system that includes in-house engineering reviews, managerial oversight and suggestion and, when appropriate, assistance from other engineering sources in the industry. Based on our experience, we have formed alliances with the best manufacturing and support organizations in the industry, among them the following:

**ACCESS CONTROL APPLICATIONS** - SIGNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC. represents Software House (Sensormatic), LENEL Systems International, Hirsch and GE. We use these same sources for Photo Imaging and Badging Systems.

**ASSET TRACKING** - At present we use HID, Axcess Products and others for hardware in conjunction with the access control lines listed above.

**CCTV APPLICATIONS** - SIGNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC. represents NICE, CISCO, American Dynamics, Bosch, Pelco, Panasonic, Vicon and others.

**NVR CONTROL SYSTEMS** - SIGNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC. represents NICE, CISCO, ONSSI, Pelco, and a variety of other vendors.

**EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT** - Commend, Stentofon and Talk-A-Phone products are our primary vendors for this application, used in conjunction with other CCTV and access control equipment.

While maintaining client confidentially, we can work with the manufacturer in the conceptual design process to ensure the functionality of the system, adequately adapt to any special application requirements and to establish favorable pricing of the system. We have found that our relationship with the manufacturer affords us the compounded expertise of many organizations, without additional overhead. The end result is system designed according to specifications and within budget.

11. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES - Signet Technologies, Inc.'s LIMITS OF LIABILITY: It is understood that Signet Technologies, Inc. is not an insurer; that insurance for whatever reason or purpose and in whatever amount shall be obtained by Customer, if any is desired; that the sums payable hereunder to Signet Technologies, Inc. by Customer are based upon the value of services offered and the scope of liability undertaken and such sums are not related to the value of property belonging to Customer or to others located on Customer's premises. Customer does not seek indemnity by this Agreement from Signet Technologies, Inc. and specifically waives any rights for indemnity for any damages or losses caused by hazards to Customers, Invitees, Guests, or property. Signet Technologies, Inc. MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, THAT THE SYSTEMS IT INSTALLS OR THE SERVICES IT FURNISHES WILL AVERT OR PREVENT OCCURRENCES, OR THE CONSEQUENCES THEREFROM, WHICH THE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO DETECT. Customer agrees that Signet Technologies, Inc. shall not be liable for any of Customer's losses or damages, irrespective of origin, to person or property, whether directly or indirectly caused by performance or non-performance of obligations imposed by this agreement or by negligent acts or omissions of Signet Technologies, Inc., its agents or employees. The Customer does hereby waive and release any rights of recovery against Signet Technologies, Inc. that it may have hereunder. It is agreed that it is impractical and impossible to fix actual damages which may arise from situations where there may be a failure of services provided, due to the uncertain value of Customer's property or the property of others kept on the protected premises which may be lost, stolen, destroyed, damaged or otherwise affected by occurrences which the system is designed to detect or avert. Due to the inability of Signet Technologies, Inc. to establish a causal connection between systems or service problems and Customer's possible loss, it is further agreed that if Signet Technologies, Inc. should become liable for any losses or damages attributable to a failure of systems or services in any respect, its total liability to Customer shall be limited to $250.00, which the Customer agrees is reasonable. The payment of this amount shall be Signet Technologies, Inc.'s sole and exclusive liability regardless of the amount of loss or damage incurred by the Customer. No suit or action shall be brought against Signet Technologies, Inc. more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action therefore.

Since it is agreed that the Customer retains the sole responsibility of the life and safety of all persons in the protected premises, and for protecting against losses to his own property or the property of others in the protected premises, Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Signet Technologies, Inc. from any and all such claims and lawsuits including the payment of all damages, expenses, costs, and attorney fees incurred by Signet Technologies, Inc., its employees and agents, from and against all claims, lawsuits and losses, by persons not a party to this Agreement, against Signet Technologies, Inc. for failure of its equipment or services in any respect, alleged to be caused by the improper operation of the system, whether due to malfunctioning or non-functioning of the system, or by the negligence, active or passive, of Signet Technologies, Inc..
