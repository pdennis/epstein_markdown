Sorry to bother you on your day off, but now I'm being told the DD wants this link chart today. Is there someone on your squad I can touch base with to find out the status of this request?

Right now we do not have a link chart, I'm on AL today but I've asked the squad to put one together.

The DD has requested a link chart on the Epstein HT case. Do you know if NY has prepared one, and if not, can we please ask them to produce one for the DD ASAP?

Thx
