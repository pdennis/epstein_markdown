Hello,

Yes, I have been here for almost 3 years. All is well and thanks for the prayers.

Hi

I didn't realize you were at MCC now. I've been sending warm thoughts and prayers all weekend to [REDACTED] and his crew, I will definitely add you too. I know these are difficult days, but otherwise I hope life is good for you in New York.
