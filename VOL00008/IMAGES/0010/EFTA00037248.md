&gt;&gt; Sorry for the delay. Was eating dinner. I got some emails that have to do with JE but also some weird email that was sent to him by someone saying 'barr' caused them pain. I'll send them to you. Don't know what it really means, maybe you can see what it is?

&gt;&gt; I think Mark is a good person, but he is very interested in women and has a lot to do with them.

&gt;&gt; The wealth of his brother is determined by the government. He no longer has much time to use his brother's wealth. He is old. He doesn't even believe in God. he has been in contact with underage girls. And...

&gt;&gt; I was going to take some money from him and give it back to him later. I'm not a thief.

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; What do you know?
