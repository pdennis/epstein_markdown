Hi Melissa,

Great questions. Fully vaccinate visitors do not need to show proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated visitors do need to test negative within two days of entering the building. Are you able to confirm whether [REDACTED] is vaccinated?

For both of you, we can refer you to a nearby COVID test site if needed.

I was just checking the SDNY’s COVID-19 protocols.

1. Do fully vaccinated visitors need to show proof of vaccination?
2. Do unvaccinated visitors need to show proof of a negative COVID test?

Thank you,
Melissa

Hi Melissa,

I hope all's well. We spoke to [redacted], and we're planning to fly her here on Wednesday morning for potential testimony Wednesday afternoon or Thursday. We've also set up a prep by phone for 6:30 eastern tomorrow. Does that work for you?

Thanks!

Also, should I coordinate logistics for [redacted] travel and setting up a prep through you, or is it all right if I reach out to [redacted] directly?

Hi

We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if need be. The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November.

I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too.

Hi [REDACTED].

I hope you had a nice weekend, and thanks again for the call last week. I’ve attached the FedEx records for which we are looking for a records custodian. According to a log, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sent FedEx a subpoena in February 2008, and the FedEx point of contact was [REDACTED].
