Hi _______________________________________________________________,

Thank you for sending this info. Plan D is owned by Epstein; Visoski is one of his pilots.
We had not heard that the plane was currently in GA.

Thanks,

I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia.
Flight plans indicate N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it operated from Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK).
It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan.

I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE.
The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to;

Plan D LLC
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Island
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager

I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. he is a pilot phone:

I don't see EPSTEIN name on any of the paperwork.
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN.

I also attached a picture of N212JE.
