Please be advised that _______________________________ is requesting his legal mail out of his property. My understanding is that there is no property officer assigned at this time so I was unsure as to who this request should be directed to. Please advise this inmate on how he should move forward. Thank you.

________________________ several inmates in SHU from 11-south are requesting to see you, at your convenience please stop by. Thank you

________________________ is requesting a legal call. However, he request one every-time he sees me. If you see it fit. Maybe someone else can provide the call for him.
