Re: Retention of Marsh Law Firm PLLC

Dear :

Thank you for speaking with me about your potential claims. We are honored that you have chosen our firm to help guide you in your path to justice and resolution. In our experience, it is useful to outline our professional relationship in written agreements, and court rules often require them. Please review these agreements carefully. We realize that much of the information may be unfamiliar or confusing, and hiring an attorney may not be a common event, so if you have any questions or comments please let us know.

There are two agreements you need to review and sign for us to represent you: (1) the Legal Services Agreement, and (2) the Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement. Once you are satisfied with the Agreements, please follow the prompts to sign, initial where needed, and return to us.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to the prospect of working with you.

Very truly yours,

Jennifer Freeman
