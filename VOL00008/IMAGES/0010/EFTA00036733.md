- Please work with Warden. I would like to TDY 3 or 4 of the best LTs in the Region to NYM for 30 days, and rotate 3 or 4 more for an additional 30 days. Be cognizant of those locations that are short LTs and dont pull from just one location. If their are superstars outside the region to consider, talk to the other CSAs but let me ask the RDs before scheduling. Thanks.
