[PRIVATE] called us on Thursday August 8th stating that he had 2 bad drives on his raid unit of the NICE Vision Pro Unit NVR. We advised him to get replacement drives. Once they are replaced they should start to initialize to become available for the raid array. [PRIVATE] did not have drives readily available. He checked with his local CSM to see if they had any spare replacement drives. Once he located replacement drives on Friday August 9th, he did not have access to the DVR room to replace them. He called Signet for phone support on Saturday August 10th when he gained access to the DVR room. He attempted to replace the drives and they started to rebuild. During the rebuild process of the drives, the drives were required to be taken out of the raid on DVR 2. Once the drives are removed without proper shutdown of the recorder, the video database becomes corrupted. Typically, any time the raid on a raid 5 configuration loses 2 drives, the raid needs to be rebuilt and all data is wiped from the raid.

Hi: Unable to locate anything official. The basic steps are as following: 1. Set the raid level to none, and save. It will be restarted with all drives being "J." [Replace any faulty drives] 2. Set the raid level to 5 and save. It will restart and being an initialization. The password is 1111 (if it recall correctly). Once the raid is created, you'll need to restart windows and create the proper partitions. S1 keep looking but that should get you going.
