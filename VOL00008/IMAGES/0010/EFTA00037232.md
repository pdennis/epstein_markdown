We spoke with Mark Epstein and were able to get the original emails from him. Bill is analyzing the headers and will send an attachment shortly with the analysis results as well as copies of those emails.

As for the YouTube video, I am doubtful that we will get a copy of this. As I understand it, Mark received an email from Jeff that had a YouTube link to a "mock interview" between Jeff and Steve Bannon. Apparently there were some comments about Trump and their relationship that Mark thought were of interest. We understand Mark received this email from Jeff sometime this year, 3-4 months ago, and viewed it at that time. When he went back a couple weeks later to view it, it was no longer available. (Sounds like the YouTube video was taken down whether it

was a private video or public video.) Mark cannot locate the original email from Jeff or the YouTube link. He is reviewing his YouTube Internet history as well as searching his emails for it.
