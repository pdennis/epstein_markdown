OK, so I've just spoken to our crime correspondent (lovely guy called Martin Evans).

Told him the basics, and he thinks it's outrageous.

We'd like to do it up as a story, if that's OK with you.

Two things -

1) how do you feel about us saying it was you who rang them? Absolutely no pressure - we can withhold your name if you would like us to.
2) do you mind my forwarding the audio to him? He's very much someone we can trust.

He will then ask SY why they are so disinterested in a hugely important case.

Let me know?

Many thanks

Peter is a blessing and love him very much.

No way, I want this on the record! Publish the whole thing if you have to.

The British public deserve to know the truth and what to do if they are ever raped or trafficked outside the UK or at least should know the procedure.

Oh my word...

Peter's support and encouragement there is just amazing.

Let me speak to a colleague who knows more about Scotland Yard than I do, and get back to you.

I appreciate you want this to be off the record, so I won't give too much detail.

I'll get back to you
