is going to see if it is just a bulb.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/14/2019 7:20 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;

The light is Suicide Watch Cell #1 is out. This needs to be replaced ASAP. As there is an inmate in the cell currently, the light needs to be working. (All cells are currently in use so he can not be moved to another cell.) He will need to be moved by the Lt. while the light is being replaced.

Thank you.
