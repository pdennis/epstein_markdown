Special Agent

I am a Threat Intake Examiner (TIE) at the FBI National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) Unit where we receive information from the public regarding criminal activity and threats to national security. The following information is being forwarded for your situational awareness and any action deemed appropriate.

On 07/09/2019 at 6:21 p.m. Eastern Time, [redacted], date of birth [redacted], telephone number [redacted] called the FBI NTOC to report that she was returning a call from an unknown FBI agent regarding the information she report on Jeffrey Epstein. [redacted] received a voicemail from an unnamed agent wanting to speak to her about the report she filed. [redacted] contacted the NTOC but did not have any information on who she needed to speak with.

Please advise if you need further assistance concerning this matter. A criminal Guardian containing this information can be drafted by the NTOC Unit upon request of the NY Division if appropriate.

Sincerely,

TIE
