I recognize these are difficult times with social distancing and lack of time in the office, but I need to be made aware of developments like this. I was asked about it by the front office about it yesterday and told them it was false. Now I need to clarify that. I think it goes without saying, I am not a micro-manager but I

Yes, SDNY had mentioned they would be sending one. I was talking with one of the ALATs in London as well; so he is aware it is in the works.

Were you aware of this MLAT that was sent to the UK requesting information from Prince Andrew?

FYI – our Office is sending the attached MLAT to Prince Andrew related to the Epstein and Nygard investigations.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

See below from [REDACTED]. Attached is the final approved version of the MLAT.

Begin forwarded message:

I've attached the request. As I mentioned, I plan to send it over with a very brief cover letter on Tuesday, after discussions with the Deputy Chief of Mission, the Ambassador (but only if he requests), and the Home Office. Also, as I mentioned, [REDACTED] recommends that there are no public announcements about the delivery of the request until after the witness declines a voluntary interview.

I will follow this up next week with an email explaining the process which usually follows after the Home Office receives an MLA request.

Have a great weekend.

Best,
