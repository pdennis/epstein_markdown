Rough estimate. 3 iPads sent for unlocking. 1 iPhone sent for unlocking, 1 iMac locked and not able to be imaged. 1 external hard drive imaged but encrypted. 2 iMac imaged and processed. 1 iMac imaged and yet to be processed. 2 windows boxes imaged and processed, 1 laptop imaged and processed. A bunch of loose media (hard drives, thumb drives, etc) imaged and processed. To date nothing has been reviewed pending a taint review. Call me to clarify if necessary. When we get back from the impending search, I can get you a better status.

Hey there,

Off the top of your head, do you happen to know how many electronic items were processed by cart? How many were analyzed? Anything pending? How many encrypted and cant be read?

Thanks,
