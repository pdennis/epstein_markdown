Hi everyone,

Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Epstein Image/Video File Review Protocol

All,

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein’s devices. The protocol asks that all reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell.

Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

- NYC024363
- NYC024394
- NYC024326
- NYC024368
- NYC024390
- NYC024334
- NYC027910
- NYC024323
- NYC024355
- NYC027908

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the teams.

Thanks very much.
