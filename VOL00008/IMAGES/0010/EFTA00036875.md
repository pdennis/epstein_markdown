This is what I admired about you! Strong! I'll come up there and make those New Yorkers smile with my "southern charm." It will be alright.
Have a good afternoon and a glass of cold sweet tea. My treat.

Hello,

I do remember you and I am glad to hear fro you. Thank you for your kind words. I don't know why they decided to provide fake and non-factual information about me, but hey, if it takes the heat off of my boss, I will take it any day. I know what the truth is and therefore, they can say whatever they want. They think they can get a response from me, they are sadly mistaken. I have been in this business a long time and could have retired years ago and I am going when I want to go. Lol! Please keep us in your prayers. We are trying to keep the staff uplifted during this time. Thanks again.

Ma'am,

You probably don't remember me but you were at Yazoo when I began my career. I admired you and kept up with your progress through the years. You and your institution are in my prayers. If I can ever be of assistance, please feel free to let me know.
