I called her with ______________________. The case she was referring to is Maxwell/Epstein. I said I would direct her email to the right place.

Do you know if this is a Maxwell reference? If not, I may contact her with an agent to see what she's talking about.

Good morning,

My name is ______________________ and I am writing to you on behalf of a friend of mine. He is currently being held at ______________________ in ______________________. He asked me to reach out to you and to let you know that he has information that can help your case that you are currently working on. He said that he knows about a guy that lives across the pond. He asked me to ask you if you would be willing to reach out to him. His name is ______________________. I appreciate you time.

Thank you,
