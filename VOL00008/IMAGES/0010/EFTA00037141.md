# Legal Services Agreement

Marsh Law Firm ("Firm") and
("Client") (the Firm and Client together are the "Parties", the Firm or Client individually is a "Party") hereby agree that the Firm will provide legal services to the Client on the terms set forth below.

## 1. SCOPE OF LEGAL SERVICES

The Client hires the Firm to provide legal services concerning any and all past, present, and future legal causes of action or claims associated with, corollary to, or arising from any and all allegations or instances of sexual abuse involving the Client and Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and/or any others participating in or in any way connected to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking insofar as those causes of action or claims are against or involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and/or other city, state, and/or federal government entities' failure to investigate Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.. This includes all causes of action or claims—including criminal, civil, and other—arising from these allegations or instances, whether in connection with one or more individual or multi-party case(s) or class action(s). These causes of action and claims are defined collectively as the "Claims."

This includes all legal causes of action—including copyright, tort, equity, and civil—arising from the creation, distribution, and possession of the Client's child sex abuse material ("CSAM"), images, videos, or likeness by any person, corporation, or other public, private, or nonprofit entity or syndicate anywhere in the world.

The phrase "legal causes of action" also includes, if applicable, all restitution requested, ordered, or paid which is associated with, corollary to, or arising from any actual or potential criminal cause of action in which the Client is, could, or might be named a victim. These causes of action and claims are also included in the "Claims."
