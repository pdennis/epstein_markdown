Sleep well,

you do not need to worry if you are not your brother's accomplice. Just remember you could have solved my problem with $12,000 and made a friend, But now you have an enemy, Until now, my motivation was to make money, but now my motivation is just to put you in jail.

One of my friends is the designer of the IRGC spy software, the same software that managed to hack the CIA site.

From now on, you and your friends and lawyers, beware of any messages, emails or software, your computer and mobile phone may be under my control.

I see the day you are in prison and all your property has been confiscated.

Bye
