Can you take a look at this list and tell the names of those I'm missing? Please indicate if they are or are not flying down on the Q400.

Thanks

6500 Estate Smith Bay

St. Thomas, VI 00802

Hello there,

The Marriott and most other hotels are still closed from the storms. The one Marriott on the island is a time share and fully booked next week. Sugar Bay has space for all.

The hotel is open for gov and recovery, etc. The gym, pool, and beach are all open. The restaurant is open for supper. We can re-evaluate when we get there. But right now, it's the only thing with gov rate.

We will re-evaluate our options Friday.

Cheers,
