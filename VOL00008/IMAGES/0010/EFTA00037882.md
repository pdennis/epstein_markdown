Officer

Thanks for your follow up.

This is a video of one of the buildings that was posted to You Tube by somebody named Rusty Shackleford (file purports to be taken 7/7, but in any event it was posted to You Tube on July 17, 2019) @ 1:50 et seq. you can clearly see a computer on one of the tables

Here's another video of the same room taken by drone, and posted to YT (file purports to be dated 8/3, but in any event it was uploaded to YouTube on August 6). @ 1:03... same room, but no computer

Both videos were taken and posted prior to the publicized raid on the island on 8/13/19.

So unless you guys can account for the movement of the computer, somebody not in law enforcement moved it. Obviously this raises questions of conspiracy and obstruction at a minimum.

I want the investigation aware of this information that is in the public domain, and that is widely discussed among people skeptical of the Epstein prosecution and suicide.
