Wanted to quickly follow up on the below (and attached), and our call last week. From the hard drive you sent that contained mostly mixed files, we ultimately were able to identify seven devices that appear to have been conveyed in individual folders -- the following NYC numbers:

NYC024363

NYC024392

NYC024328

NYC024365

NYC024366

NYC024371

NYC024383

There are two things that are odd about this list, that we need clarification on, please. The first is, on your spreadsheet, it says that NYC024392 was not yet ready and hadn't been provided to us. Did we get something else under that number, or was the number incorrectly listed on the spreadsheet as incomplete?

And second, I don't see any listing at all for NYC024328 on the spreadsheet -- I believe the list goes 236, 237, 239. It's entirely possible I'm just missing it -- please let me know if so -- but if not, did you send us a device that wasn't previously identified on the spreadsheet? And if so, are there other devices we should be expecting that aren't currently listed? Or was it just a typo? Please let us know as soon as possible, since those seven folders are all in the process of being sent to our vendor for processing into platform-readable files and uploading.

Also, are we still on track to receive all of the devices extracted individually on Wednesday?

thanks,

Here you go. Almost everything is over at Southern once I drop off the phones. Just 1 laptop and 2 desktops to

get to you. I has to re-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have already produced, I can re-work it to split things out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get something moving. Any questions, let me know.
