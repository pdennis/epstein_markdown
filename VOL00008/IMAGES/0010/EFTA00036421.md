Congratulations to the August 9, 2019, graduating ERT T4T class and welcome to the group. They had a few people (9) cancel out of their class but we were able to make some last minute phone calls and get some people to step up and make

some last minute plans (THANK YOU VERY MUCH). Graduates welcome to the ERT T4T group. Please remember do not give away to future T4T's our Thursday surprise. Next class is January and it will start our FY20 classes. I have sent out to a first round of T4T's to schedule them for the FY20 classes to come out to MSTC and get them re-certified. I am not getting a lot of responses so I will be moving on to the next names shortly to request you to come out and re-certify. I want to get started on the classes as soon as possible. IF you get to go to a CMT as a ERT T4T to re-certify PLEASE let me know so I can update the master list.

Please also let me know if you transfer to another institution so I can keep the Master list up to date.

Their has been a lot of questions about the CD burner lately and which one is authorized to get. As long as you are NOT going to be connecting it to the BOP Network or any BOP Computer, your facility/IT can approve it without going through Central Office. We are only making a recommendation and NOT ordering or mandating that you get them. It will however make it easier for you when you need to make copies of the photos that you took during the Crime Scene. IF you get the single CD burner you will have different times on the Chain of Custody for when the CD was created (found). IF you are able to find the multi CD Burner and the CD's all come out at the same time then you would have the same times on the Chain of Custody.

Info is coming in that the CD Burner that we recommended is no longer available and is outdated. from FCI Tucson did a little leg work and found the attached model that is a single burner and portable (Nice work).

AUSP is trying to set the standard and came up with a PREA Major Mock Scenario. Maybe you can make it fit your facility.
