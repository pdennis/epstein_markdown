Hey ,

We just mailed out some NYPD hats, pins, patches and task force coins as another way to say thanks to you and the squad. Please make sure everyone that helped out grabs something!

Thanks again,

&gt;
&gt; Enjoy the holiday. You earned it.

&gt; Just want to thank you and your team for the assistance provided over the past few days, especially SA [ ] who was outstanding! This was an important case for our Task Force and for the FBI. You dropped everything, gave it your full attention and made it a priority. The team you assembled was extremely impressive and today's entry couldn't have gone any better. Please pass on my appreciation to everyone that participated, I am truly amazed at what we can accomplish as an organization with such great people. Thanks again!
