Your guys got a big job at McKean..

&gt;&gt;&gt; [REDACTED] 8/8/2019 4:20 PM &gt;&gt;&gt; [REDACTED]

Please be advised the bids are back and Hotfoil -EHS, Inc will be awarded the contract. The total is $213,260.00. The purchase order is being typed tomorrow 8-10-19. The SCS from Elkton, [REDACTED], is off until Tuesday, she starts duty officer and will be in at 12:30 pm. She has reviewed all our documentation and will sign the purchase order for McKean. I have also reached out to [REDACTED] SCS at Lewisburg. If Mr. [REDACTED] is in tomorrow we will have him sign the PO instead of waiting for [REDACTED] on Tuesday.

Now we are working on purchasing the locks with our locksmith Mr. [REDACTED]. Mr. [REDACTED] is working on getting quotes and that should be purchased shortly.

We will keep you posted.

Thank you for your patience!
