Let me know if you need anything in Palm Harbor. I have the Crimes Against Children Task Force folks that should be able to assist if anything is needed.

Got it. I concur. The Winter Garden area is covered by SSRA _______________________________ (Lakeland RA), and the Palm Harbor area is covered by SSRA _______________________________ (Pinellas RA). I have copied both on my concurrence.

Just an FYI, as a result of the Epstein arrest and indictment, we will be traveling to Florida to interview approximately 25 victims. Most of the victims are in the Miami/West Palm Beach area, however, two victims are believed to be in Winter Gardens and Palm Harbor. Just wanted to let you know we will be in your AOR, flying down tonight and starting interviews tomorrow. Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
