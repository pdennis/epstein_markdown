Sorry for the delay. Here is my essay and thank you for letting me know that you received my application otherwise I would start to worry. Also I really do need a flight booked back to New York preferably the 27th as it is high season here and there might not be any available flights at the end of the month. Can you please check with Jeffery and let me know.

Thanks ever so much
