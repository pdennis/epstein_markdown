Warden,

Per our conversation, I spoke to two of his attorneys yesterday, August 9, 2019, primarily in relation to his request for access to water in attorney conference. Attorney Mariel Colon, with whom I spoke in person in the late morning, had asked as an aside whether we would consider housing him in the Cadre. I advised we could not since he was a pretrial inmate. Later that day but prior to the 1:00 close-out meeting, I spoke to Attorney Michael Miller on the phone. He had asked whether we could house Mr. Epstein alone in SHU, to which I replied that we could not based on his prior suicide attempt/gesture. He acknowledged that he understood. To my recollection, neither attorney referenced consideration for suicide watch or psychological observation during yesterday's conversations.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thank you,
