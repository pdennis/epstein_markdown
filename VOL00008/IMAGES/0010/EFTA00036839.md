As of today approximately 6:15 AM Electronic Technician [redacted] informed me that here at MCC NY we have a total of 161 cameras. At this time we are recording on the new system 141 - 146 cameras we need to work on 15 -20 cameras to get them operational, approximately at this time we have 110 cameras labeled correctly at the recorder. Tomorrow Jeff from Signet and [redacted] will be finishing what they can and testing the system on generator power. From this day forward Monday - Friday days any Electronic Technician or Telecommunication Specialist is here at MCC NY I will be getting an update on camera outages which I will forward to my AW and Warden. Any questions please let me know.
