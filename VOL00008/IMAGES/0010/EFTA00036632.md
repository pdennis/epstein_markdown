[REDACTED] - The FBI is going to be retrieving the previous recordings from or camera system at MCC, but because we were having difficulty retrieving the recordings, they have told us the recording capabilities will be off line for up to 8-10 days while they retrieve this data. We will still have live viewing/monitoring. My question: are there options for remote recording from another location, or do we possess other equipment that can be connected to the system while the current recording capabilities are off line?
