No worries, I was just looking for a couple of good agents but we have enough.

Subject: Trip to St. Thomas

Hey,

I saw the ERT email that went out the other day. Unfortunately next week is pretty busy for me with proffers Mon-Tues and a trip to DC on Wed-Thurs for an HSI coordination meeting. But I can see if I can re-schedule any of those if you're desperate for additional bodies. I may be able to get someone to cover the DC trip for me.

We are heading down to St. Thomas to execute a search on Epstein's island. I'm looking for some extra manpower if you're able to go, approx. Sun (8/11) to Wed. (8/14). Let me know if you're able.

Thanks,
