I know you have lot to do. Do you want to perform the Mortality Review for inmate Epstein this week? We have 30 days to complete the review. The people that need to be present are the CD, HSA, 1-MLP and AW over Health Services. I'm on leave next week.

Very Respectfully,

No problem, but will need time to look up policies and procedures for each specific thing.

Thank you,

The Supplement is outdated and needs to be updated. Not only with the Naloxone but with other information. You will need to review the entire supplement for updates. Thanks.

Hi AW , we can add the Naloxone information in this supplement. I will place Naloxone information in this Supplement and send it to you for your review and if you are OK with it and the Warden is OK with it, we have him sign.

Good Morning,

We need to find time to review the attached Supplement to ensure it is up to date. I would like to add the Naloxone in it instead of creating a new Supplement just for Naloxone. This is what the other institutions have done. Your thoughts? Thanks.
