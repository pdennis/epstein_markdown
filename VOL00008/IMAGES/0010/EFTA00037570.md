I was just getting ready to shoot an email to [REDACTED] that we won't have anything for today. We are planning for Mon-Fri reporting.

We are consolidating all reporting (VCAC, VC, and CR) through [REDACTED]. Assume CID will be consolidating too? Is that through you or the VC side?

Please let me know if y'all have an update planned for today (or not).

Thanks,

See below. The VC squad has nothing planned for today on the Epstein case. Can we make sure VCAC has nothing planned as well?

FYI,

Per NY, no updates planned for this weekend by VC Squad.
