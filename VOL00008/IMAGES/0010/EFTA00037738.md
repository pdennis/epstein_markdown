Contact has been made and is amenable to be interviewed. However, she asked for three things, two of which require your input, the third related to location of the proposed interview and the MET has offered their space to which she was agreeable. Her questions are as follows:

1. Will an attorney be provided for her as she doesn't have the finances to hire her own
2. Can she have a list of questions beforehand

Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.

Kind regards,
