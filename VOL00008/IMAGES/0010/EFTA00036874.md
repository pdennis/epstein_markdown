Good Afternoon,

As your supervising Associate Warden, it is my goal to have a one on one with each of you and provide you with my expectations. Due to the current situation, I am unable to do this at this time. However, I do want to pass a few things on to you until we can have a sit down discussion:

(1). Please ensure you have accountability for your staff because when you are not here and something happens, I am the next in the chain of command to have to respond. If you are out, please ensure that you have an Acting and that Acting knows that he/she is/will be given the same courtesies as you.

(2). Timely submission. Please ensure that you submit paperwork in a timely manner. Meaning that if you are late, please don't email it to me and expect me to print, proof, route, etc... This is not professional and not my job. Submit your T&amp;A in WEBTA timely.

(3). Provide me with your leave requests for the entire remainder of the year. Please ensure that those previous and current requests are entered in WEBTA. I would hope that you would have a discussion with me prior to submitting them in WEBTA.

(4). If you are late or call in sick, please do not leave me a voice mail message or text. Please contact me on my BOP cell phone at [redacted]. Once you arrive at work, please submit your leave in WEBTA.

(5). Comp Time must be pre-approved by me. No exceptions. Once worked, a Comp Sheet must be completed and routed in a folder for my review and then I will forward it on to the Warden.

There are additional expectations forthcoming and will be discussed in person during our meeting. You will have your opportunity to discuss any concerns you may have at that time as well. Thanks.
