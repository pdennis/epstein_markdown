Yes, yesterday afternoon we received official requests for information from MOJ and the French Police. My understanding is that the French want to open an investigation and are asking for our Intel on any French nexus to victims or subjects under French jurisdiction.

Hi _________________________________________________________________________

I'm happy to discuss further. I likely won't be able to get to sync until a bit later today. As far as Epsteins travel, he traveled frequently to Paris and did have an apartment there.

Do you know what the present status is? Has France decided to open an investigation?

Hi _________________________________________________________________________, FBI and DOJ in Paris received requests this morning from French authorities to furnish any additional information regarding the ongoing cases on Jeff Epstein as it relates to France? This stems from the fact that the someone in the USG asked France to furnish travel information for Epstein in and out of France. Additionally, it has come to our attention that Epstein owned an apartment on _________________________________________________________________________, Paris France 75116.

Let me know when you can discuss further over Lync is preferable?
