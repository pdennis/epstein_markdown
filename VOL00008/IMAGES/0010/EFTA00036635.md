Recently, if you watch the news, you will see some things happening around our agency that does not highlight the great work we do each and every day. I just want to remind you that the work you do is important and valued by everyone. Even those who often times don't understand what that work is or they do NOT walk in the shoes we walk in daily.

This message is to remind everyone of the policies and protocols we put in place in order to keep people safe! Example; 30 minute irregular rounds, walking and talking, detailed counts, close attention to detail, and being positive, responsive, and proactive while working in a correctional environment.

Our message as an Executive Team to everyone is we "Do the Right Thing, at the Right Time, for the Right Reasons"! We ensure this by being caring human beings, charged with a very important task for the responsibility, safety of staff, inmates, and the community. This is an awesome challenge and each and every one of you should be proud and honored to take on.

Be cognizant of the message you put out in the community as we are all representatives of this agency. The only person designated to speak with the media is our designated Public Information Officer.

Thank you for what you do! At McKean...
