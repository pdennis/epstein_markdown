Subject: Epstein Claims Fund Program

The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein has created a Claims Fund Program to compensate the victims of Mr. Epstein. If a victim was abused by Mr. Epstein, she is eligible to participate in the Program. Victims are eligible to participate in the Program even if their claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations or if they previously entered into a settlement agreement with

Jeffrey Epstein in the past, assuming other criteria is met. There is no cap or limitation on the amount of funds available to the Program to compensate all eligible victims.

This Program is different from the lawsuits that have been filed or could be filed against the Estate. The Program is voluntary, which means that each victim has the right to choose whether or not to participate. If the victim has a claim that is not barred by the statute of limitations, she can choose to file a lawsuit and litigate her case rather than participate in the Program. She can also choose to participate in the Program and litigate her case in Court at the same time. The Program and the lawsuit are independent of one another.

The Program is run by Program Administrator Jordy Feldman. Each victim who chooses to participate in the Program will submit her claim (comprised of the details of her abuse and proof of her damages). Ms. Feldman will then make a determination as to the monetary value of her claim. Each claim will be evaluated separately, meaning the dollar amounts awarded to compensate each victim will differ and are made irrespective of one another.

Ms. Feldman will run the Program independently from the Estate. This means that the Estate will not be involved in determining the amount of compensation awarded to each claimant. Ms. Feldman will make those determinations on her own without input from the Estate. The Estate will be provided with the names of the victims who submit claims to the Program, but they will not have access to any evidence that each victim submits to support her claim.

After Ms. Feldman has evaluated a claim, she will issue a letter to the victim or her attorney including the amount of compensation that the Program is willing to pay to compensate her. At that time, the victim can either accept the amount of money being offered to her and sign a release precluding her from continuing any litigation or taking any further action against the Estate, or she can reject the amount of money offered and, if she chooses and the remedy is legally available, proceed with/file a lawsuit.

By way of brief relevant background, the Estate intended to have this Program approved by the Court in the USVI on February 4. Shortly prior to the hearing, the Virgin Islands Attorney General filed a lien against the Estate preventing the Program from beginning because she did not believe that the tenants of the Program were favorable to the victims. We worked together with both the Estate and the USVI AG over the past few months to improve the Program so that the AG would allow the Program to move forward. As you know, an agreement has been reached and the Program is moving forward. The only reference that was made to the FBI in the Agreement is that Jordy Feldman, as Program Administrator, will inform claimants that counseling is available to them through FBI Victim Services or other similar entities, as would be available to them whether or not a Program existed. The FBI has not been obligated to do anything outside of the normal course of business by way of the Agreement; your tremendous work on behalf of victims has only been highlighted.

I know that the news articles are often times inaccurate and can be confusing. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like clarification on anything.
