Dear _________________ and _________________,

I am a DCI in the Met Police in London, and have been given your contact details by DCI _________________, who I understand did some work with you back in 2021 in relation to the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

As you may be aware, there has been significant media reporting in the UK about (former) Prince Andrew and his activities both with _________________ and efforts he has allegedly made to get information about her through his protection officers.

The UK media also appear to be in possession of certain material from the Oversight Committee, including flight manifests from when JE arrived in the UK with other passengers and further allegations around trafficking etc.

I am reviewing these allegations, and wanted to enquire if you still had any active investigations in relation to this matter, and if your team had any involvement in the Oversight Committee hearings and any material being presented there.

If it would be beneficial to arrange a meeting please let me know, or alternatively if you are no longer involved with this case, I would be grateful of any contact details you have for anyone currently involved in the matter.

Kind Regards

Detective Chief Inspector _________________ | Complex Case &amp; Exploitation Command | Major Inquiries | Specialist Investigations
