6. Brief Synopsis of Case :
In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his hands and/or sex toys. Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages."

On August 10, 2019, a search warrant for Epstein's private island, Little Saint James located off the coast of St Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands is expected to be sworn out. The warrant will be executed on August 12, 2019.

A team of FBI/NYPD will travel from New York, NY to St Thomas U.S. Virgin Island on Sunday August 11th, 2019.

On Monday August 12th, FBI/NYPD team will reach Little St James (LSJ) and execute the search warrant. The group will divide into four teams and conduct a security sweep of the entire island, making entry into any and all structures. Team 1 will sweep ALPHA - Zone 1, Team 2 will sweep BRAVO - Zone 2, Team 3 will sweep CHARLIE - Zone 3, and Team 4 will sweep DELTA - Zone 4 (see attached zone descriptions). All individuals encountered on the island will be searched for weapons and once cleared, will be brought to a central location (TBD) for interviews. Agents/TFOs will attempt to identify employees on the island to provide access to locked structures and containers. In the event a structure or container needs to be accessed the Breech Team will be contacted.

Once all zones are secured search teams lead by FBI ERT will search any and all structures on LSJ. Teams will then break off to conduct any interviews of all persons found on LSJ.

# Department of Justice Policy Statement
On the use of Less-Than-Lethal Devices

I. Department of Justice (DOJ) law enforcement officers (officers) are authorized to use less-than-lethal devices only as consistent with this policy statement.

II. Pursuant to this policy statement, less-than-lethal devices:

A. Are synonymous with “less lethal,” “non-lethal,” “non-deadly,” and other terms referring to devices used in situations covered by this policy statement; and

B. Include, but are not limited to:

1. Impact Devices (e.g., batons, bean bag projectiles, baton launcher, rubber projectiles, stingballs);
2. Chemical Agents (e.g., tear gas, pepper spray, pepperballs); and
3. Conducted Energy Devices (e.g., electronic immobilization, control, and restraint devices).

III. DOJ officers are authorized to use less-than-lethal devices only in those situations where reasonable force, based on the totality of the circumstances at the time of the incident, is necessary to effectuate an arrest, obtain lawful compliance from a subject, or protect any person from physical harm. Use of less-than-lethal devices must cease when it is no longer necessary to achieve the law enforcement objective.

IV. DOJ officers are authorized to use only those less-than-lethal devices authorized by their component and that they are trained to use, absent exigent circumstances.

V. DOJ officers are not authorized to use less-than-lethal devices if voice commands or physical control achieve the law enforcement objective. DOJ officers are prohibited from using less-than-legal devices to punish, harass, or abuse any person.

VI. Less-than-lethal devices are used with a reasonable expectation that death or serious bodily injury will not result. They are, however, recognized as having the potential to cause death or serious bodily injury, and DOJ officers may use less-than-lethal devices as deadly weapons only when authorized under the DOJ Policy Statement on the Use of Deadly Force.

VII. DOJ officers must make necessary medical assistance available to subjects of less-than-lethal device use as soon as practicable.

# FBI DEADLY FORCE POLICY

Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.

A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.
B. Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles.
C. If feasible, and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force.
D. Warning shots are not permitted.
E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy.

This policy is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.
