I hope that you and your family have been well.

A brown envelope addressed to you from Atkins Fine Clothiers, Pebble Beach, CA was sent to 9 East 71st St and is now at my office. What address should we forward this to?

Thanks,

Andrew

Hi,

Thank you for your email.

Things are a bit crazy right now.

Darren could see you at his office on Monday from 9-11. I know he is scheduled to see someone else that morning as well but it should be alright. Please let me know if that will work.

Hi

Hope all is well.

I'm flying to FL on Saturday and returning Tuesday. It is important that I speak to Darren face to face. Something of interest has come up. Please tell him to let me know where/when to meet.

On another note, I will be in Paris from the 25th to 28th. Would it be possible to get into Jeff's place there so I can isolate family items, and photos that might be there. I don't want to take anything with me but would like to have them put aside so they don't disappear or get dispersed. Please let me know.

Thanks,

Mark
