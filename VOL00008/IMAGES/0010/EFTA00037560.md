Thanks, .and sorry about all of the questions, e-mails, and phone calls.

For now, PM will be the POC for CID. Please also cc me on everything. That way, if I get pinged late or early, I can try to minimize the disruption to NY.

Copy. Our plan will be end of day reporting Mon - Fri. Having just gone three weeks straight and with the case slowing to a normal investigative pattern, at this time I don't foresee us working weekends. If that changes it would be due to a significant event which we'll brief up.
Just let us know who the designated CID POC is.
Thanks

We are consolidating all reporting (VCAC, VC, and CR) through . Assume CID will be consolidating too? Is that through you or the VC side?

See below. The VC squad has nothing planned for today on the Epstein case. Can we make sure VCAC has nothing planned as well?
