Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Company shall not be obligated to make any so-called residual, rerun, foreign use, or theatrical use payments with respect to any motion picture produced pursuant to the rights granted to Company herein. The compensation payable to Author herein is an all-inclusive flat fee and shall constitute full and sufficient consideration for any and all uses of the Productions, and all elements thereof, in any and all media, whether now known or hereafter developed, throughout the universe, in all languages, in perpetuity, in all versions (including without limitation digitized versions), and for any and all  |

| --- | --- | --- |
|  29. | No Partnership/Joint Venture | Nothing herein contained will constitute a partnership between, or joint venture of, the parties to this Agreement or establish either party as the agent of the other. No Party hereto will hold itself out contrary to the terms of this section, and no Party will become liable for the representation, warranty, act, or omission of any other contrary to the provisions hereof.  |
|  30. | Remedies | a) Author's Remedies / No Injunctive Relief: Author acknowledges that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement by Company or any third party, the damage, if any, caused to Author thereby will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle Author to seek injunctive or other equitable relief. Author acknowledges that its rights and remedies in any such event will be strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover damages in an action at law, and Author shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement or any of Company's rights hereunder, neither the right to enjoin the distribution, publication, or other use of the Granted Rights or the exercise of any right in and/or to the Productions, nor the right to enjoin the production, exhibition or other exploitation of any motion picture produced pursuant to the Granted Rights, any element thereof, any subsidiary or allied rights with respect thereto, or any other results and proceeds of Author's services hereunder, nor will Author have the right to terminate their respective services or obligations hereunder by reason of such breach. Without limiting the foregoing or Company's other rights under this Agreement or at law or in equity, under no circumstances will any act or omission of Company which would otherwise constitute a breach or alleged breach of this Agreement be deemed such unless Author notify Company in writing setting forth in detail the basis for such breach or alleged breach and Company fails to commence reasonable efforts to cure such breach or alleged breach within thirty (30) days of Company's receipt of such notice.

b) Company Remedies: The rights and services which are the subject matter of this Agreement are of a special, unique, extraordinary and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in an action at law and which would cause Company great irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, to preserve its rights and interest in and to such rights and services. This provision shall not, however, be construed as a waiver of any rights Company may have for damages or otherwise arising from any breach of this Agreement. At all times, Company shall have all rights and remedies which it has at law or in equity pursuant hereto or otherwise, all of which rights and remedies shall be construed as cumulative.  |

|  31. Copyright | a) **Protection of Copyright**

i. Author shall ensure that the Property will be protected by copyright and will be registered in the United States Copyright Office in Washington, D.C. for copyright protection, following initial publication in the United States. In connection therewith, Author agrees and acknowledges that (1) the Property is a work of authorship protected under Title 17 of the United States Code and is intended to constitute, and does constitute, “intellectual property” within the meaning of sections 101(52)(E) and 365(n) of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), and (2) the rights of Company hereunder are “rights to intellectual property” within the meaning of such sections.

ii. Author shall take all reasonable steps at Author’s expense to protect all copyrights pertaining to the Property from infringement, and Author agrees that it will institute such action and proceedings as may be reasonable to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation by third parties of the Property or any part thereof which may be in contravention of the rights granted to Company hereunder. Company shall provide Author copies of all documents executed pursuant hereto.

iii. If Author elect not to take any action in the event of an infringement of copyright or of the Granted Rights, Author shall so notify Company promptly, in writing, and Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take such action as Company shall deem reasonable in the circumstances, at Author’s sole cost and expense. Author appoints Company as its attorney-in-fact (which power is coupled with an interest) to act in its name for the purpose of permitting Company to prevent any unauthorized use, reproduction, exhibition or exploitation of the Property or any part thereof.

iv. Author further agrees that it shall not take any steps to prevent, challenge or otherwise hinder Company from registering any and all of Company’s interest in the Productions with the United States Copyright Office in accordance with this Agreement.

b) **Copyright Termination**

i. If at any time after Company’s exercise of the Option, Author or any party succeeding to Author’s termination interest or otherwise claiming through Author or any other party so empowered by law is deemed to have any right to terminate any or all of the rights granted to Company hereunder (the “subject rights”) pursuant to Section 203 or 304 of Title 17 of the U.S. Code (the “Copyright Act”) or any other laws of the United States, or any of its subdivisions, or of any foreign country, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to preclude Author from freely exercising said right to terminate. Any exercise or further grant of the subject rights  |
| --- | --- |

so terminated shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this paragraph. Any such right to terminate the subject rights shall in no event apply to any rights granted to Company hereunder other than those rights arising under the Copyright Act or any comparable act of a foreign country. If the parties do not reach an agreement with respect to a reacquisition of the subject rights prior to the effective date of such termination, Company shall have a right of first negotiation and last refusal with respect to the subject rights as follows: If at any time, Author proposes to accept or make a bona fide offer to produce, license, transfer or exploit ("Exploit") any of the subject rights, Author shall first offer to negotiate to grant such rights to Company by giving Company written notice of the rights which Author desires to Exploit and the terms and conditions of any proposed transaction. Within ten (10) days after the receipt of such notice, Company may notify Author whether or not Company desires to negotiate, failing which Company shall be deemed to have elected not to negotiate. If Company notifies Author within such ten (10) day period that it elects to negotiate, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith regarding the subject rights for a period of thirty days thereafter. If Company agrees to negotiate, but such negotiations do not result in an agreement between the parties within such thirty (30) day period, then Author thereafter may negotiate with any third party with respect to the subject rights; provided, that Company may meet any bona fide third party offer which Author are willing to accept (or which is proposed by Author to any third party) ("Third Party Offer"). Author shall give Company written notice of the Third Party Offer, specifying its particulars, including, but not limited to, the identity of the offeror or offeree, the price and other terms, and Company shall have the exclusive right for ten days after its receipt of such notice to acquire the subject rights upon the terms and conditions in Author's notice; provided, that Company shall not be required to meet any term of condition of the proposed transaction which may not be as easily met by Company as by any other party. If Company exercises its right within such ten (10) day period, then Company shall be deemed to have acquired the subject rights and Author shall execute and deliver such additional documentation as Company may reasonably request to further evidence such acquisition. If Company fails to exercise its rights, Author may make or accept the Third Party Offer; provided, that if the transaction contemplated by such Third Party Offer is not consummated upon the terms and conditions in Author's notice within sixty (60) days after the expiration of such ten (10) day period, or if such transaction is so consummated but the subject rights return to Author for any reason, then Company's rights hereunder shall revive and apply to each

EFTA00037032

further Third Party Offer regarding the subject rights.

ii. Author agrees to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to prevent the Property from becoming public domain material to the extent possible; (to the extent required by law) to cause to be affixed to each copy of the Property or any part thereof published or offered by sale by or with the authority of Author, notice of copyright complying in all respects with the U.S. copyright law and with the Universal Copyright Convention; and to register the Property wherever necessary for such protection. If the Property or any part thereof is unpublished at the time any motion picture or sound record produced hereunder is published or released, it is expressly agreed that any statutory copyright secured by Company in its own name hereunder, covering such motion picture or sound record, shall extend to any and all copyrightable component parts of such motion picture or sound record, and shall be held by Company and that Company may, if it so elects, obtain separate statutory copyright protection for the Property or any part thereof in the name of Company, or otherwise, as it may elect.

iii. Author recognizes that a material part of the consideration motivating Company to enter into this Agreement is that Company shall enjoy all rights granted to Company for the full term of any and all of said copyrights (including, without limitation, all extensions of such copyrights, and to the full extent for or at any time hereafter permitted by law, the renewal term of all United States copyrights involved). If any United States statutory copyright in the Property or any part thereof was existing prior to January 1, 1978 and is in its initial term as of the date thereof, Author agrees to make application for, and secure a renewal of, each and every such United States copyright involved, prior to the expiration of each such copyright, or, if Author is not entitled to renew any such copyright, Author will use its best efforts to cause the person entitled to do so to make application for, and secure a renewal of, such copyright; and in either event Author will promptly notify Company in writing that such renewal copyright has been applied for and has been secured. Promptly after each such copyright has been renewed, Author shall, without payment of any further consideration by Company, execute and deliver to Company, or cause to be executed and delivered to Company, such further instrument or instruments as shall be necessary or proper to vest in Company all of the rights herein granted for the full period of such renewal copyright, upon and subject to all of the identical terms, conditions, limitations, representations, covenants and warranties herein contained, except for the monetary consideration herein specified. Regardless of the execution and delivery of any such instrument, all such rights shall be deemed to have

EFTA00037033

|   |  | been acquired by Company under such renewal copyright upon and subject to all of the terms, conditions, limitations, representations, covenants and warranties herein contained simultaneously with the effective date of renewal of such copyright.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  32. | Legal Clearance | Upon Company's request, Author shall cooperate with Company or any attorneys for Company or any insurance company providing errors and omissions insurance for the Productions, in connection with the legal clearance of such Productions  |
|  33. | Public Domain Material/Member of the Public | Nothing contained in herein: (a) shall at any time limit Company's right to utilize freely, in any work or production, any story, idea, plot, theme, sequence, scene, episode, incident, name, characterization or dialogue or other material which may be in the public domain, whether included in the Property or derived from some other source; or (b) shall be construed to be prejudicial to or operate in derogation of or prejudicial to any rights, licenses, privileges or property which Company may enjoy or be entitled to as a member of the public, as if this Agreement were not in existence. Company may exercise any such rights, licenses, privileges or property at any time and in any manner, whether or not competitive with the activities of Author. This section shall not affect the scope or validity of Author's representations, warranties or indemnities in this Agreement.  |
|  34. | Applicable Law | This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the state of New York. The Parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts of the State of New York located in the City of Manhattan, which the Parties acknowledge and agree are convenient forums to litigate any such action. The Parties waive any right to transfer such action to any other court and expressly consent to the permanent jurisdiction of such courts with respect to the resolution of any disputes under this Agreement and agree to be bound by the judgment rendered by such courts.  |
|  35. | Additional Documents | a) Without limiting Author's obligations or Company's rights under this Agreement, Author shall execute, acknowledge, verify, and deliver to Company or cause to be executed, acknowledged, verified and delivered to Company any and all further assignments, instruments and documents pertaining to the Granted Rights, consistent herewith, which Company may request and deem necessary to effectuate the purposes and intent of this Agreement and in the form Company may prescribe, after opportunity to review; provided, however, that Author's failure or refusal to do so shall not affect any of Company's rights in the Property, or any of Author's representations or warranties with respect thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Author agrees to timely obtain or cause to be obtained renewals of all copyrights in and to the Property. If Author fail or refuse to do so after a reasonable opportunity to review and negotiate such instruments or documents not to exceed five (5) business days (or three [3] business days in exigent circumstances as  |

|   |  | determined by Company in good faith), Author hereby appoints Company (which such appointment is coupled with an interest and hence irrevocable) as Author's attorney-in-fact to execute any such instruments and documents in Author's name and on Author's behalf and to institute and prosecute such proceedings as Company may deem expedient to secure, protect, or enforce the rights Company is acquiring hereunder. Company shall have the right to place the same of record in the U.S. Copyright Office and elsewhere as Company may determine. Company may sue in its own name or may use the names of Author or may join Author as party plaintiff or defendant in any such suit or proceeding. Company shall provide copies of all final documents to Author executed on Author's behalf under this section following Author's request therefor provided, however, inadvertent failure to so provide such documents shall not be a breach thereof. Notwithstanding the failure or omission of any party to this Agreement to execute and/or deliver such additional instruments, it is agreed that upon the exercise of the Option, all rights agreed to be transferred to Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed vested forever in Company, effective as of the date of the exercise of the Option, which rights shall be irrevocable under any and all circumstances, subject to reversion provided for in section 18.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   |  | b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author shall execute the short-form assignment (hereinafter, the "Assignment") attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. If Company shall exercise the Option and pay the Series Purchase Price and/or the Film Purchase Price, Author's signature on the Assignment shall be deemed to be effective and the Assignment shall constitute a valid and binding agreement and assignment and shall be deemed to have been executed, and shall be dated and deemed to be effective, as of the date of exercise of the Option. Company is authorized and empowered to date the Assignment accordingly. If Company fails to exercise the Option, then Author's signature on the Assignment shall be void and of no further force and effect whatsoever, and Company shall not be deemed to have acquired any rights in the Property other than the Option provided for in this Agreement.  |
|   |  | c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Author shall execute and deliver to Company the short-form option agreement (hereinafter, the "Option Agreement") which is attached to and incorporated in this Agreement. Company may record the executed short-form Option Agreement at any time, and may record the executed Assignment (but only after exercise of the Option and payment of the Series Purchase Price and/or the Film Purchase Price) with the U.S. Copyright Office and with the copyright office or comparable registry of any country.  |
|  36. | Assignment | Company may transfer and assign this Agreement or all or any of  |

EFTA00037035

|   |  | its rights or privileges hereunder, and/or delegate all or any of its obligations hereunder, to any person or entity. In the event of such assignment or delegation, Company shall remain secondarily liable hereunder (unless such assignment or delegation is to a so-called "major" or "mini-major" motion picture distributor or television network, any similarly financially responsible party, or any party which substantially controls, is substantially controlled by or is under common control with Company or which through merger, consolidation or acquisition succeeds to substantially all of the assets of Company, and such assignee/delegee assumes in writing all of Company's obligations hereunder, in which event Company shall be released and discharged from all of its obligations hereunder and Author shall look solely to such assignee or delegee, as the case may be, for performance thereof). Author may not assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, except with Company's prior written approval, and any such purported assignment shall be deemed null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Company's successors, licensees and assigns.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  37. | Miscellaneous | Nothing herein shall be construed to require the commission of any act contrary to law. In the event of any conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any present or future statute, law or regulation, the latter shall prevail and the affected provision of this Agreement shall be modified only to the extent necessary to bring it within legal requirements, such provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement to the extent required to bring it within the legal requirements and the remaining terms of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver by either Party of any failure by the other to perform hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other obligation. Company may deduct and withhold from Author's compensation all amounts required to be deducted or withheld under any present or future statute, law, ordinance, regulation, order, writ, judgment or decree.  |
|  38. | Entire Agreement | This Agreement (including exhibits and all accompanying documents) contains the entire understanding between the Parties regarding this subject matter, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements between the Parties with respect to Property, whether written or oral, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement. No officer, employee or representative of Company has any authority to make any representation or promise in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement that is not contained in this Agreement and Author has not executed this Agreement in reliance upon any such representation or promise. Any modification or amendment of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both Parties.  |

b) “Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts” means Gross Receipts less the following items on a continuing basis in the following order: (a) a 15% distribution fee; (b) distribution costs and expenses incurred in connection with distribution and other exploitation of any Ancillary Uses (including, but not limited to, any and all development, production, manufacturing, publishing, publicity, advertising, marketing, promotion, delivery, and guild residual/reuse costs associated with such Ancillary Use, but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs and expenses (which Tax Credits are not excluded from Costs deducted pursuant to clause (f) below)) (“Expenses”); (c) the contingent portion of any agency package commission payable on account of any Ancillary Use (defined below); (d) any and all third-party participations payable by Company in connection with the Project, other than those payable to net profit participants; (e) interest on the Costs (as defined below) at an annual percentage rate equal to 2% over and above the rate announced from time to time by J.P. Morgan Chase as its prime rate on unsecured loans (“Interest”); and (f) any and all costs incurred in connection with the development, production, and delivery of the Project (as defined in the Agreement) (including, but not limited to, any amounts payable to Participant) (collectively, “Production Costs”), but less all Tax Credits received and credited against such costs, plus an overhead charge of 15% of the Production Costs and Interest (“Overhead”) (Overhead and Production Costs, together, “Costs”).

d) "Network Services" means all ViacomCBS Media Networks ("Network") branded and/or affiliated worldwide content distribution services, blocks, and feeds made available on any platform (including television, online, players, areas, applications, etc.) and in any manner (including linear, on-demand, non-permanent download, etc.), by any means of transmission (including cable, satellite, telecom, internet, wireless, cellular, etc.), and/or on any device (including television, computer, tablet, mobile, etc.), whether now known or hereafter devised.

Third-Party Network Services do not include services or portions of services that charge a per-item transactional fee for the exhibition of one episode, series or project.

f) Interest will be charged only on the unrecouped Costs (i.e., (1) the aggregate of all amounts chargeable to Costs, minus (2) the aggregate of Gross Receipts, in each case on a continuing and cumulative basis) as of the mid-point and end-point of the applicable semi-annual accounting period.

g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Exhibit or in the Agreement: no exploitation of any subsequent production(s) based on the Project (each such subsequent production, a "Derivative Production") (as contrasted with exploitation of the Project) will constitute an Ancillary Use unless the Agreement specifically so provides; if the Agreement does specifically so provide, then, nonetheless, if Participant is engaged to render services and/or is entitled to receive contingent compensation in connection with a given Derivative Production, then revenue from such Derivative Production will not be included in the calculation of Participant's Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts participation set forth in the Agreement.

h) The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of the foregoing sentence, such subsequent productions that are a result of the sale, licensing, or other exploitation of the Project format ("Format Licensing") do constitute Derivative Productions, but because Format Licensing is an exploitation of the Project (and not of a Derivative Production), revenue from Format Licensing itself does not constitute Derivative Production revenue; however, license fees and (provided Participant is not otherwise receiving any contingent participation from such Format Licensing)

G:\VIT\S\A\Ined No Word\S\Inced No Word_Literary Option Agreement_x2.docx

EFTA00037039

contingent participation(s) from Format Licensing will be included in the calculation of Gross Receipts.

i) Company shall account to Participant with respect to Participant's share of Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts, if any, within 90 days after the end of each semi-annual period in which there are payments due Participant, and such statement of accounting will be accompanied by payment of Participant's share (if any) of any monies payable for such semi-annual period. Participant may, at Participant's own expense, audit Company's books and records relating to the Project in order to verify statements of accounting rendered hereunder. Each such audit will be conducted solely by a reputable firm of certified public accountants, upon reasonable advance written notice to Company, during reasonable business hours, at Company's offices, and in such manner so as not to interfere with Company's normal business activities, and, concurrently with each report such firm furnishes to Participant, such firm will furnish a true copy thereof to Company. Such right to audit is limited to the Project, and neither Participant nor Participant's representative will have the right to examine records relating to Company's business generally, or with respect to any other projects, for purposes of comparison or otherwise. Participant may so audit once per calendar year and each audit may continue for up to 30 consecutive calendar days. The records supporting the statements may not be audited more than once. Company's methods of treating any amount referred to in this Exhibit for tax or financial purposes will have no bearing on the computation of Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts. Each accounting statement furnished by Company pursuant to this Exhibit will be deemed conclusive and binding unless Participant objects thereto to Company in writing within 12 months after the statement is issued, stating in detail the basis for the objection. Participant may not bring any legal proceeding later than the expiration of the period of the applicable statute of limitations established by law or 12 months after making such objection, whichever occurs first. If Company makes any overpayment to Participant hereunder for any reason, Company (a) may deduct and retain for its own account the amount of such overpayment from any amounts that thereafter become due or payable by Company to Participant or for Participant's account, or (b) may demand repayment from Participant, in which event Participant shall repay such amount promptly.

j) Participant acknowledges that Company is part of a diversified, multifaceted, international company, the commonly-controlled and third-party "affiliates" of which include, or may in the future include, among others and without limitation, exhibitors; television, online, wireless, application, and other "platforms"; networks, stations, programming services, distributors, video device distributors, cable and/or satellite operators, record companies, video game companies, and publishers (literary and/or electronic); and wholesale and/or retail outlets (individually or collectively, "Affiliated Company(ies)"). Participant further acknowledges that Company has the right in its sole discretion to make use of Affiliated Companies in connection with the distribution and exploitation of the Project as, when, and where Company deems it appropriate to do so. With respect to Company's dealings with commonly-controlled Affiliated Companies, Participant expressly waives any right to object to such distribution and exploitation of the Project (or aspects thereof) or assert any claim that Company should have offered the applicable distribution/exploitation rights to third parties (in lieu of, or in addition to, offering the same to commonly-controlled Affiliated Companies). In consideration thereof, if Company enters into any agreement with a commonly-controlled Affiliated Company with respect to any disposition of rights in the Project, the consideration for which falls within the definition of Gross Receipts hereunder, then Gross Receipts shall be credited with an amount equal to the reasonable value of such rights as determined by Company in its reasonable business judgment. Participant acknowledges and agrees that Participant's sole remedy against Company for any alleged failure by Company to comply with the terms of this subparagraph will be money damages, and Participant

G:\VfZ\Derecel No Word\Derecel No More_Literary Option Agreement_v2.docx

EFTA00037040

hereby waives any right to seek or obtain preliminary or permanent equitable relief in connection with any such alleged failure.

k) If any provision(s) (or any portion(s) of any provision(s)) in this Agreement conflict(s) or could be interpreted to conflict with this paragraph for any reason (including, without limitation, any references to court, jurisdiction, judiciary, jury, action-at-law, or any other terms), the terms of this paragraph will control. Participant and Company agree that any and all controversies, claims or disputes arising out of or relating to this Exhibit and/or the conduct of the Parties hereunder or in connection herewith ("Dispute") will be the subject of good faith negotiation. If after good faith negotiation the Dispute is not resolved, and either party wishes to pursue the matter further, the Parties agree that the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration at the New York City office of JAMS, or its successor ("JAMS"), pursuant to the procedure set forth in subparagraph A. below. (A.) The arbitration will be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified herein, in effect at the time the request for arbitration is made (the "Arbitration Rules"). The Parties agree that a Dispute will include the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate and the arbitrability of the Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim of waiver. The arbitration will be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator will be a former or retired judge or justice of any New York state or federal court with substantial experience in matters involving the entertainment industry, who is affiliated with JAMS. The arbitrator will follow New York law in adjudicating the Dispute. The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision which will be part of the arbitration award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding except to the extent that limited judicial review is permitted by applicable law. The Parties are to share the arbitration costs and the arbitrator's fees equally. Each party will remain responsible for its own attorneys' fees. The Parties waive the right to seek punitive damages and the arbitrator will have no authority to award such damages. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed. Neither the Parties nor the arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, testimony, evidence or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal, statutory or regulatory requirements. Before making any such disclosure, a party will give written notice to all other parties and will afford such parties a reasonable opportunity to protect their interests. If either party refuses to perform any or all of its obligations under the final arbitration award within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered, then the other party may confirm or enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York. All Parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York for purposes of confirming or enforcing any arbitration award. This clause will not preclude the Parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York. (B.) The Parties acknowledge that this provision constitutes a waiver of each party's rights to a civil court action or a jury trial concerning matters covered by this provision; only an arbitrator, not a judge or jury, will decide the Dispute.
