Let me know if you have any questions about the above staffing or their duties/functions. Thanks

We appreciate all you've done to stabilize the MCC. Keep up the good work. The meetings and tour today were very helpful.

Can you please send me the information about the personnel you've added to the MCC, including the additional warden, the lieutenants and COs. I want to make sure I have the numbers and titles are correct.
