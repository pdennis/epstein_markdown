Importance: Normal

The Council of Prison Locals is advising all subjects and witnesses associated with this incident to remember, Art. 6, section f(1) "If an employee reasonably believe discipline may result, (2) he/she should exercise their right to requesting a representative. All staff are reminded Art. 6, section h, which protects them from answering any further questions until a representative is made available. I also, advise staff to read Art. 7, section e (2). Understand, the FBI will also be investigating this event. This doesn't applies to the FBI. So, if they desire to speak with any subject (s) or witnessed of an investigation stemming from this, I would strongly advise those staff seek or request assistance of counsel (Attorney).

IN UNITY!!
