Hi all,

Thanks for volunteering to help tomorrow. As of right now, if people could be on standby around 9:30/10 to help with victims. Some victims will be meeting at SDNY before the hearing so we may need some help corralling them and getting them to the courthouse without the press. I'd say for now to hang around 290 and I should have a better idea in the morning.

Also, I'm sorry to ask, but please be in a suit tomorrow. This is coming from the higher ups.

Thanks again!
