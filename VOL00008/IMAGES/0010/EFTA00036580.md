I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 times.

I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

Thanks.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-mail me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Thanks.
