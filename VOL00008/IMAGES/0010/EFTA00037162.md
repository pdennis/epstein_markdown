# Oh, I understand! I thought you were looking to be seen together.

# The other female therapists are booked this week. I am away quite a bit

# over the summer, but if it helps I can see her 2pm Wednesday 2nd July or

# 12pm Sat 5th July at Portman Square. I might be able to fit in some

# other sessions with her over the summer before I return fully from

# Summer break in September.

# Let me know if that would be ok to

# Sheri
