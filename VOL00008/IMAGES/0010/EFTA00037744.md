Good afternoon,

Amazon's response to the attached grand jury subpoena is overdue by **several weeks**. The FBI has emailed and left messages with your legal department several times over the past weeks without a response.

Please respond promptly to resolve Amazon's non-compliance. Otherwise we will initiate contempt proceedings regarding your failure to comply with valid legal process.

Sincerely,
