By the time arrived at the SHU Epstein was already removed from the cell and being treated. was assigned to follow EMS to the hospital in a BOP auto.

FBI cart was able to package video of the MCC into a viewable format as was requested by SDNY.

Coordination was made with BOP Thomas' attorney to retrieve Thomas' cell phone on Monday 8/26 and have it imaged by FBI CART who has already been made aware of the request.

OCME was contacted and they advised that FBI will be furnished with a final report and all previous documents requested once they finalize their report. OCME advised that Dr who administered the autopsy and one of the executives are having a meeting in the afternoon (8/23) regarding Epstein. OCME anticipates the report to be finalized soon and not requesting any further information at this time.

On Monday 8/26 three (3) proffers are scheduled of inmates who were in the MCC at the time of Epstein incident. These proffers in the past have dealt with not only Epstein but also guards at MCC allowing in contraband and/or any possible violations of BOP policy.
