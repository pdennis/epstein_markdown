Following up on our conversation from Friday, our chiefs would be happy to do a general team meeting – are there times tomorrow morning and/or early Thursday that would work for all of you? I know it’s many schedules to work with, but we’ll figure out a good time and get it on the books and we can all do an overall discussion and update.

many thanks,
