Good Afternoon,

In regards to Ghislaine MAXWELL (DOB: ), attached is her MA license (still active until 2022), driver's history. Queries in ISO, MA criminal history, vehicles registered in MA, and Coplink (LE encounters) returned negative results. The only report MAXWELL is listed in is the report from Gloucester PD filed by BORGERSON – attached in his Coplink reports.

EFTA00037650

In regards to Scott BORGERSON (DOB: ), attached is his license, driver’s history, criminal history, all registered vehicles, ISO insurance claims, and Coplink reports listing LE encounters in MA (Beverly PD is listed but there is no PD report, to obtain this you would need to contact them). There is a report from Gloucester PD that mentions BORGERSON, his ex-wife, as well as MAXWELL.

In regards to MA registration , no records were located in Coplink for any accidents or traffic stops. A query of the registration in ISO showed one vehicle claim by Scott BORGERSON in 2018. Attached is the vehicle registration for . There were no results in our LPRs – it should be noted that we do not have access to the LPRs on the turnpike, to obtain those you would need to reach out to Mass DOT.

Though MA registration did did not hit in our LPRs, other vehicles BORGERSON has registered to him did. I’ve attached the results.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Respectfully,
