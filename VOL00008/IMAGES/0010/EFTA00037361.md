Thanks [REDACTED]...also, got a question from [REDACTED]. Have we been in contact with our known victims since Epstein's death? I recall [REDACTED] mentioned that either we or the VS had made contact but wanted to confirm before I responded to [REDACTED].

Thanks [REDACTED], I agree there is probably no need to search the plane but it is possible we may pursue a seizure at some point in the future, but we are not there yet.

John Penza reached out a short time ago. He indicated a contact of his let him know that Epstein's plane is currently in Brunswick, Georgia for maintenance. John was passing this along just in case we had a need to locate or perhaps search the aircraft. I let him know we probably did not have a need to locate the plane at this time, but I would pass the information along.
