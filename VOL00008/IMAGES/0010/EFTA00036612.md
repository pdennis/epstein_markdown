Hi - here is the DRAFT of a memo - we were waiting on the highlighted information from HRSC - if and her staff have fill in those items, we can move ahead - just don't want to duplicate efforts - can reach out to she has any questions - thank you!

This is first attempt. I am asking for the highlighted info in the attached. We can take out the retention piece if we decide to only go with relo and recruitment.
