CDC in Miami is [redacted] the advised his contact in OGC did not think it was a good idea. They don't feel comfortable with our files being released out of our custody to a third party. OGC was going to reach out directly to [redacted]. I spoke with [redacted] and she had not touched base with OGC as of yesterday afternoon. Below is the long email history on this issue.

Hey [redacted],

Wanted to follow up on the scanning issue – I know Florida had said they'd get you an answer last Monday, but I take it they didn't – any update from them at all? (This Friday will mark three months since we originally asked Florida to get these docs scanned.) And assuming they're just leaving us hanging, is there a particular person we should have our leadership call? I think they may just call the FBI general counsel, but if you have a different suggestion I can pass it along.

thanks,

Definitely – let me check with the other two AUSAs on the case and I’ll get back to you as soon as possible. (I’m going to the grand jury at 2:00, so may not circle back until a little after 3:00, but will for sure get back to you.)

Sorry just to clarify, it was [redacted] who we talked to about using a vendor—Julio had him be the contact person when we were calling and emailing with them about it a month ago. [redacted] woke to [redacted] early May via phone about sending the materials to us so we could give them to a vendor, all of which he generally said would be fine and asked us to memorialize it in an email to him, which we did more than five weeks ago, on May 7. Sometime after that I guess FBI New York prevented them from sending the materials to us, and then another month passed before you guys received the materials a week ago. Wanted to correct the [redacted] distinction (though we also contacted [redacted] about the materials generally as well).

Great, thanks very much for letting us know. On the files, we were able to look through yesterday but just to clarify it will be the computer searchability that will really help us (flipping through unfortunately has nothing on Control-F capabilities). But sounds like we're in progress with Julio—and hoping for progress on the physical evidence as well.

thanks again,

We are waiting on an answer from Miami legal [redacted]. In the meantime you can come over and access the files anytime you want. I apologize for the delay but NY legal will not authorize the release of the files without Miami's concurrence. I know you mentioned dealing with Julio in the past and he didn't seem to remember giving this the green light. However, I do think they will ok it, he is going to get back to me asap.

Thanks.

Hi [redacted]

Wanted to check in on the below—any update on the status? I can't emphasize enough how desperately we need access to those records.

The other issue that has been stalled for many weeks is obtaining the physical evidence from Florida, which we also really need—if there's any way for us to help get the gears turning on that, we'll do anything at all that would be useful.

thanks,

Got it, thanks, and that sounds good. Miami was ready to send the records directly to us back in April so Limagine they won't object, but if they need any info from our end just let us know. (We were dealing with [redacted] case that's useful.)

thanks again,

I spoke with NY legal and they want concurrence from Miami legal. I think we will be good, if it stalls I'll suggest a conference call. I'll keep you posted. Have a great weekend.

Wanted to follow up from last week and to see if the records had arrived? Or if not, to just make sure there weren't any problems – not sure how they were shipped, ETA, etc.

We will get the status on the files asap, my understanding is the case file contained numerous volumes with multiple boxes and they may be a bit disheveled as a result of the previous review. I recognize and appreciate your urgency, I will make sure we get an answer today and get these files up here immediately. I spoke with my ASAC and he's open to the idea of the third party scanning, but he wants the files coming here first to get an accurate assessment before a decision is made. I assure you we are not going to sit on this, hopefully we can get the files up here, if they are not already enroute, and move forward with the approvals for your vendor.

Thanks

Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them available for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. Our understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the case team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession of [redacted]). So I'm not sure what still needs to be located?

And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs to know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to whoever we need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us (or even directly to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the materials arrive.

We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors to have it resolved.

Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they should call)? And thanks again for your help.

Thanks we are still trying to locate the files and determine a time frame on the delivery. I'm discussing the situation with my ASAC and FBI legal, I don't think they're opposed to your idea but right now they don't want the files going direct to the USAO. We'll probably need to get the files here, see what we have and hopefully everyone will be amenable to the third party scanning as discussed. We'll touch base after the holiday.

Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned.

The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.):

U.S. v. Chamberlain
U.S. v. Adelgla
U.S. v. Ng Lap
U.S. v. Tortora
U.S. v. Ashraf
U.S. v. Goldbre
U.S. v. Vargas,
U.S. v. Krupkin

U.S. v. Cruz, overdose death

In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem.

Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week.

thanks again,
