Of the 10 co-conspirators, 3 have been located in FL and served GJ subpoenas; 1 in Boston, 1 in NYC, and 1 in CT were located and served. 4 of the 10 are outstanding with attempts having been made. 1 is a wealthy business man in Ohio, a lead is being sent to CV; the remaining 3 are currently out of pocket. The team (8 SAs/TFOs, 2 AUSAs) is flying out tonight/tomorrow to various locations in Florida to interview approximately 25 victims. The 1-800-CALL-FBI line is up and running, we have received approximately 45 calls which we are in the process of vetting out. Let me know if you need anything else.

Good morning

A/SC [redacted] is requesting an update on the 10 co-conspirators by COB today.

Can you tell us how many have successfully been located/interviewed/served with GJS? I believe the breakdown was 5 in New York, 1 in North Carolina, 1 in Boston, and 3 in Florida.

Please let me know if you need anything from us.

Thank you,
