See attached reconstructed SROs.

I attached 2 copies of Epstein SRO reviews:

1. Epstein_Reno76318-054_SRO_20190710-20190723.pdf (confined in SHU 7/10/2019 - 7/23/2019), and
2. Epstein_Reno76318-054_SRO_20190729-20190810.pdf (confined in SHU 7/29/2019 - 8/10/2019)

Because the first confinement, Epstein was held only 2 days in SHU (7/7/2019 - 7/8/2019), NYM did not review Epstein.

Thanks.

SRO review data is stored in DREV table. But SHU generates SRO review for inmates are currently in Z house. I need to write some code to get around to get the SRO reports for Epstein.

, these are good. Thanks. Also, need any data you can get for SROs (SHU reviews). Apparently since he was "notorious" he should have had more frequent reviews. Do we have any data indicating the SRO?

I attached Epstein 292 forms from 7/7-2019 to 8/10/2019. During this periods, Epstein was moved in and out from SHU 3 times.

I looked into his SHU history records and filled SHU administration data into 292 history reports.

Thanks.

As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death (Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-mail me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.

Thanks.
