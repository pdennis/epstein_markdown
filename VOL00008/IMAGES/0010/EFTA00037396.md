, unfortunately, the more recent flyover was conducted of Greater St James. But I'm taking your crew on a site survey around Little St James on Saturday morning. The photos they acquire may be able to provide a clearer picture of the island.

Your thoughts?

Here is the aerial photo of the island we've been using, from Google earth. Do any of you know if there is a more recent aerial photo?

- is there a better photo you have from the recent flyover?
