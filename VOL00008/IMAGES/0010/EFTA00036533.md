Per your request... this is the CPD AD Memo I am referring to, dated June 24, 2019. The majority of the 13 cases I sent to yesterday, will be included in my next email, were denied a couple days thereafter. However, it should be noted, they were prepared well in advance of this memo and in accordance with 5100.08 and the CIM Manual.

I appreciate your assistance and will send you the case we discussed momentarily.

Wardens - See below. This will be part of the discussion at the September training. As indicated in the attached, separations and transfers should be the last option after all other policy driven options have been considered. Thanks
