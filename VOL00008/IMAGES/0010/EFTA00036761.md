Hey man it's **100%**. Tdy from Canaan just want to let you guys know to keep your heads up over the I know they will probably place a lot of a blame on you guys for what happened. But everyone knew about the staffing crisis over there and didn't anything about it. I know you guys do your best everyday because I saw it first hand. Just know I'm letting all the staff here know how good the shu crew and the staff I worked with was and this is no way a reflection of the work you guys do. God bless and keep your heads held high.
