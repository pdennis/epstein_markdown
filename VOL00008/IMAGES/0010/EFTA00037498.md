Subject: JE victim assistance

[redacted],

[redacted] from DOJ contacted me and plans to arrange a meeting in the near future with victims associated with JE (from the first investigation until his death). [redacted] would like to coordinate with the VS(s) assigned to the case as well as anyone else you feel has established good rapport with the victims. Please let me know whom [redacted] should coordinate with.

Also, I've been asked again about the info for NCA. Please let know how we should respond.

Thanks,

[redacted]
