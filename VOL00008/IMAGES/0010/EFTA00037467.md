Just want to thank you and your team for the assistance provided over the past few days, especially SA [REDACTED] who was outstanding! This was an important case for our Task Force and for the FBI. You dropped everything, gave it your full attention and made it a priority. The team you assembled was extremely impressive and today's entry couldn't have gone any better. Please pass on my appreciation to everyone that participated, I am truly amazed at what we can accomplish as an organization with such great people. Thanks again!
