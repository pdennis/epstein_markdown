Good morning [Redacted]

We received the following request from the cantonal police of Wallis :

***

On 02.06.2020, a person called EPSTEIN Mark from New York City contacted the operations centre of the cantonal police of Wallis in CH-Sion.

Later on the same day (at 16:21 hours and 16:24 hours), he sent an email to the said police service.

He stated that he was the brother of EPSTEIN Jeffrey, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in custody.

When he was investigating his brother's death, he allegedly came by chance across a conversation between a person unknown to him - "Mim Mim" - and a Mister HAUB.

EPSTEIN Mark also sent a screenshot of the Linkedin profile of "Mim Mim" and a screenshot of two messages from "Mim Mim" in which the unknown person threatened EPSTEIN Mark with the death of his children.

On 04.06.2020, at 13:30 hours, we called EPSTEIN Mark. He told us, that his deceased brother and HAUB Karl Erivan were possibly murdered.

He takes this assumption from the statements of the mail contents sent by the unknown person "Mim Mim".

HAUB Karl Erivan is missing since 07.04.2018, after a ski tour in the high mountains of CH-Zermatt.

Up to now, there are no indications that the disappearance of Mr. HAUB in CH-Zermatt, could be due to a violent crime.

The below listed information was taken from the e-mails forwarded to us by EPSTEIN Mark, which were sent between 30.05.2020 and 04.06.2020:

- "Mim Mim" and HAUB Christian (brother of the missing person) allegedly had a conversation.
- "Mim Mim" claims to have received hush money from BUSS Leander (alleged security officer of Tengelmann).
- "Mim Mim" allegedly sold documents
- The disappearance of HAU Karl Erivan and the death of EPSTEIN Jeffrey are allegedly connected.

Furthermore, EPSTEIN Mark L. stated to have been in contact with the following FBI agent:
