As you know I dont have a Psych Administrator. After discussion with Hugh, we're asking the following be completed first thing tomorrow by the appropriate Psych Svc employee: Reach out to NYM Chief Psych or Acting Chief, and review each inmate that is currently on watch, recently on watch, or Psych Alert, and ensure they have been properly evaluated, properly housed, and all documentation required regarding psych evaluations and PDS have been completed. Please have someone notify meet once complete. Thanks in advance.
