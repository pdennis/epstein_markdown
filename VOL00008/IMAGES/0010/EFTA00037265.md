To Whom It May Concern:

I'm a fact check reporter for The Daily Caller investigating a potentially false claim about the island of Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands that has been circulating online. The claim is that the FBI recovered human bones in the water near the island, which was previously owned by Jeffrey Epstein.

Has the FBI found or recovered human remains of any kind on or near the island since Epstein was arrested on July 6?

If you could respond as soon as possible, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
