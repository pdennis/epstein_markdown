Thanks for including me on this last email. I was not on any of the previous emails, so not sure who was receiving. Is there an email that has the actual threat? If we get that, I can forward to interpol. Alternatively, any indication who at AFP has been contacted already? If you can provide a name, I can engage directly with them.

Thanks,

I presume it may be helpful to know in which Australian city/state your victim currently resides.

Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to you all in Australia because I'm currently working the Jeffrey Epstein investigation in New York and one of the identified victims in this case is living in Australia. We received information about a threat being made against her for speaking out. We have notified her through her attorney. Her name is , DOB . She has reached out to the AFP and they've asked for confirmation about this threat. The threat was made by an anonymous individual. Information is limited at this time. We are investigating it.

I wanted you to be aware of this so you have it FYSA and to pass along confirmation to the AFP as necessary.

Please feel free to reach out with questions/concerns.

Thank you,
