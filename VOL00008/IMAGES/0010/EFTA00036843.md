I don't know why they decided to provide fake and non-factual information about me, but hey, if it takes the heat off of my boss, I will take it any day. I know what the truth is and therefore, they can say whatever they want. They think they can get a response from me, they are sadly mistaken. I have been in this business a long time and could have retired years ago and I am going when I want to go. Lol!

Hello,

Thank you. All is well. I am standing on the promises of GOD and I know that he will see us through all of this, including the fake news and lies. I appreciate your support and continued prayers as we continue to try to uplift staff and maintain our professionalism and composure/serenity.
