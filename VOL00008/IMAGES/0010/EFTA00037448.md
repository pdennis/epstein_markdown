Hey

See emails below. The travel request needs to go through you ADIC to the AD of IOD for permission to travel. CACHTU will support the request with funding. I got the request on the red side and will respond to that with the EAN. Let me know if you have any questions.

Take care,

The purpose of this trip is for the interview/proffer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's. The time and location for this interview has been arranged by the witnesses attorney who has been historically been difficult about changes. Both the witness and her attorney reside in London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators. For these reasons we request to travel while there is a temporary travel restrictions due to the corona virus. Below are the following expected expenses:

Airfare: $696 x 2 ($1392)
