Hey all,

I wanted to send a follow-up email about the device review. See below on who is covering what device. Happy to talk through and sit down with those of you I haven't. Everyone should be set up by end of day today to have access to the case. The AUSAs have asked that you read through the attachments to be familiar with it. They would also like to set up a call sometime later today to touch base with all of you about the review. Is there a time everyone could get on a call, maybe around 3:30 or a little later?

Let me know.

Thanks!

Hi everyone,

Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the

EFTA00037666

system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

I'll be around to assist/help as needed and answer any questions that may come up. Please feel free to reach out with questions.

All,

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell.

EFTA00037667

Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

- NYC024363
- NYC024394
- NYC024326
- NYC024368
- NYC024390
- NYC024334
- NYC027910
- NYC024323
- NYC024355
- NYC027908

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the teams.

Thanks very much.
