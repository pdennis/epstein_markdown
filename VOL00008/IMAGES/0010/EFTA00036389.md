Good afternoon,

Per the attached, representatives of the DAG's Office and the USAO SDNY will be touring SHU, Inmate Epstein's cell (to the extent it does not contaminate the crime scene), and the suicide watch area on 2. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Supervisory Staff Attorney
