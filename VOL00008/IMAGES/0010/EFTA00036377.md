Dear, Warden welcome on board M.C.C. New YORK, we spoke the other day on 10South High security unit. I just wanted to run this by you, the bunk beds in the S.H.U. unit are not centered in the middle of the cell. Making it very difficult in seeing the inmate in the cell, especially at night. If it could be done to weld the bunk in the center of the cell, it would make the inmate more visible and better seen during counts and rounds.
