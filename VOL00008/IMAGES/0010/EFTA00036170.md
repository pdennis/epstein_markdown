### Table of Contents

Did you know you can easily add a Table of Contents to anything you create in BOP? Use the Style menu in the editor to select any of the Header styles and the header text will be added to the Table of Contents with a link to that part of the content. Then insert the Table of Contents from the &gt;&gt; menu in the editor and the Table of Contents will show up where ever you inserted it.
