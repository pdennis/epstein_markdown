I'm walking into take a deposition now in JPM. Today and tomorrow. That case is going well.

For the DB case, that was a class case and a very good result. JPM should be better.

&gt; Hi Brad,

&gt; I wanted to congratulate you on the win with Deutsche Bank. Is that a class action? Are you happy with the settlement figure?

&gt; What are your thoughts on the JP Morgan lawsuit?

&gt; Kind Regards
