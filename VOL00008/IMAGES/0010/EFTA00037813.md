&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt; Sean just wanted me to reach out to you guys, I interviewed the air traffic control guy Pat, and through a couple phone calls, we believe that St. Thomas Jet Center (__________, Pat Hatch, employee) dealt with Epstein's helicopter. I called over there to confirm and they said the company has no comment and will not confirm anything regarding Epstein. Just wanted you guys to know in the event a subpoena was needed.
