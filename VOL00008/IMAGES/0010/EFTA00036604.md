Update:

IPPA AD [redacted] made an edit to his offenses &amp; then DOJ had us say investigated by FBI (even though FBI told us in the past not to say that). DOJ is talking with FBI now to confirm this latest version...so this is NOT final yet, but MAY end up being the approved version attached. I'll probably send to all media that emailed me (over 50 emails) and then I'm guessing they'll tell me to have [redacted] send it people to email or call him, etc., but I'll get back to you on all this.
