We had every intention on getting the materials from the ADELGLASS search scanned but we did not. it was a lot of back and forth with the SDNY.

However, we did get the materials from the search of CITY MEDICAL scanned and they were patient medical files. SDNY took care of arranging. We did not have any problems at all. After they were scanned, the documents were loaded into Relativity and we reviewed them in there.

Thanks

SDNY is requesting we turn over to them one of our files in its entirety so it can be scanned by a third party vendor. The AUSA mentioned that he did this for your case, U.S. vs Adeglass (see below). I was wondering how this went, if there were any legal hurdles with the request, any issues I should be aware of before I agree? We've never had a request like this but it makes sense due to the enormity of the file. I have been getting pushback from legal regarding turning a whole file over to the USAO. Just wanted to get your take on this before committing.

Thanks,

Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned.

The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.):

U.S. v. Chambers
U.S. v. Adelglass
U.S. v. Ng Lap S
U.S. v. Tortora, S
U.S. v. Ashraf Ha
U.S. v. Goldbrenner
U.S. v. Vargas, R
U.S. v. Krupkin, O
U.S. v. Cruz, ove

In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem.

Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week.

thanks again,
