I've been saying that same thing from day one. The body of FITARA was simply to address gov overspending on IT, and was designed for mass purchases.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/13/2019 6:28 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;
I completely understand the reasoning behind the law that FITARA claims to fall under. Its just too bad that the BOPs FITARA memo has nothing to do with the 400 page law. Fitara has caused nothing but headaches for us here at Danbury

Thank you fellows. It just took a little push to get the right message out there. Not patronizing, just playing Devil's advocate. Just knew somebody would be a little more articulate explaining where the BOP is going with this. We personally like our NICE system, since 2006, and understand the reason behind Fitara. It just takes a while and patience for people to accept change. It happened with us.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8/12/2019 1:02 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;

OH YEAH. Sorry couldn't resist. Always been a big fan of Mr. Kool Aid.

I do like the idea of a national supported system that would standardize the FBOP. It only makes sense. We have Motorola, Medtel and CEIA as universally recognized systems. I think most would agree those three were good choices and we would probably all fight tooth and nail to keep them. I can't say that I'm a fan boy of putting our systems on BOPNet. Everyone being on a different system has been the comm tech's best defense against absorption by IPPA and keeping local authority over IP assignments and network infrastructure.

I don't think hiring a contractor to provide third party multi-manufacture support was ever a good idea. Avigilon was purchased by Motorola a while back. They have a good camera selection with a Windows based recording system just like all major CCTV VMS manufactures these days. The problem with standardizing is if the selected system isn't what you cut your teeth on you probably won't like it. Great thing about Avigilon right now is few to none of us have it or have even seen it so everyone would get a new system and be on the same learning curve.

If Motorola offered a direct customer support contract to the FBOP for Avigilon on a nation wide bases it would be a good contender for standardization in my book. Also any other system manufacture with direct national support and separate network infrastructure would get my vote also. Every system I've seen was plagued by the same problem and that's a windows OS so what does it really matter?

Just to add a different point of view on this. There are currently 2 systems approved for BOP use (more specifically for new purchasing). NICE and Avigilon. We got a lot of Avigilon products FITARA approved and added to the approved hardware list a few months ago.

As I see it, the main issue is the contract with SIGNET. We have a BOP-wide maintenance contract with them for our DVR/NVR systems. Currently, that contract is set up for NICE, Pelco and Vicon. With only 1 manufacturer on both the approved hardware list and maintenance contract, we're in a bit of a pickle. I do not know when the contract is up for renewal. I can see Avigilon being added to the contract, and Pelco and Vicon remaining with only legacy support.

On one hand, it seems the BOP is trying to relatively standardize camera systems nationwide. Along with radios and telephones, cameras are probably the most used system we have that has actual user interface; specifically for transferring staff. Having the same system across the board will benefit a lot of people. Also, having a standardized system also helps with staff assist visits. A tech from Yazoo would know how to work on a system in Marianna. Another consideration is the BOP Command Center and Backup Command Center are both NICE-centric platforms from what I understand.

On the other hand, yes, someone in Central Office seems to have gotten the agency to jump head first in to the SIGNET/NICE pool. The main reason that I can think of as to why is the migration to IPv6. NICE was one of the first. Vicon and Pelco were way behind. I am not saying any of this to bolster NICE. I have my reasons for pushing to get Avigilon approved as I feel it is a far superior system. But, with seemingly 75-80% or more of the BOP already on NICE, it does make sense to go ahead and standardize across the board if possible.

Personally, I would love to roll out a bunch of Avigilon systems. Like all of you, I have my personal takes on the equipment that I like to work on. I would love to standardize all of the systems we have from coast to coast. That would cut down on training expenses, spare parts packages, improve responses to emergencies and staff assist visits, etc. Unfortunately, there is too much bureaucracy with our purchasing guidelines and required approvals for purchases such as these.

I have probably heard as many positive reviews as negative reviews from BOP techs regarding NICE. Personally, I went to NICE training a few years ago to check it out and was entirely unimpressed. I am sure that there have been changes to the system since then that would alleviate many of my negative thoughts on the system.

I'm certainly not championing or trashing NICE. I just wanted to lay out some other trains of thought as to why things might be going the way they are right now. There are many camera systems out there so very out of date that they are practically useless. It would seem money is finally being made available to rectify that situation.

This was just my $.02. I'm not trying to get anyone to drink the Kool Aid. Take it for what it's worth.

Yes, ...and no. To each their own but I do agree with, "if ain't broke, why fix or replace it?" And If I do need to replace it, how about taking some input from the individual(s) who actually install and maintain the equipment. They just might know a little bit and surprise the people behind Fitara with what they know; the more options the better. Each Institution knows what works for them.

I don't know, but when everyone says the same things about something, can everybody be wrong??

Here in Victorville FCI 1 we have had Nice since 2006 and it has been amazing. We got an update in 2014 and it has been a really solid system. In 2017 they replaced a Viconet system at the FCI 2 that was in really bad shape. Since their upgrade they have been really happy. I did not have any of these problems you guys are experiencing now. I'm guessing it has to do with the Windows upgrade. Once these issues are ironed out I'm sure you guys will love your new Nice system like we do here in Victorville. It has been the best Camera system I have ever worked with. Just give it a chance!

Nothing to contribute here. Just an observation that this is the new system they are pushing down to us?

Hello,

Looking for some help or advice from anyone using NICEVision. I just tried logging into Administrator to unlock an account and I get a pop up that states "Database Error." I click "ok," and it closes the application. I'm getting the error on the AMS as well as a BOPNet computer that is running the NICEVision software. I reached out to [redacted] but he is out of the office and I haven't heard back from anyone at the tech support number he left. If anyone has any ideas or has experienced this error, I'd appreciate any advice or guidance to fix it.

Thanks in advance.
