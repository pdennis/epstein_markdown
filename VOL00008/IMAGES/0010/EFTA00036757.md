Good Afternoon All:

If you are called for an interview by the agency or a representative of the agency (ie. FBI, AUSA, OIA, OIG), you are required to report the interview. You are required to be truthful.

In line with your Weingarten rights, once at the interview you have the right to request a Union Representative. In line with the rights afforded to any other US citizen, during a criminal investigation, you have the right to invoke your 5th amendment right to remain silent until your attorney is present.

Blessings to all.

In Unity!
