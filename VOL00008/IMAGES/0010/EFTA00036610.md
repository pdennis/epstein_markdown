Thanks. Just FYI, we do have a limited number of SAMS in other USPs. We hold them there pending their ADX hearings. Not all USPs, but a select few. I routinely had one at McCreary.

FYI from last night...

They do house SAM inmates there. SAM are Special Administrative Measures.

See:
https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-24000-requests-special-confinement-conditions

Only the AG can put a SAM on an inmate and this results in significantly limiting an inmate's communication. We have SAM inmates in 10 South and at the ADX (I'd have to check to see if we house anywhere else, but I don't think so). There are very few inmates subject to SAM as this is very limiting, and generally are due to national security cases.

Have a good day off (I hope it's a day off). We can talk at your convenience. Thx.

Good. Yes. [REDACTED] is great...young and has a bright future. I'm not aware of another name for 10 South. That's how we refer to it. I double checked with [REDACTED] and all said same.

Anytime you come up for air feel free to call to catch up on visit. Thanks!

The tour went well. The warden is impressive. Will catch up with you when I can.

What is the other name used for 10 south?
