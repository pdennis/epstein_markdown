Got a call back from Theresa's office manager. She requested all contact go through her. Her phone number is [redacted] and her email is [redacted]. She advised me that Theresa will not be able to make it today as she is in the hospital with her father. She also requested a subpoena be sent requesting her testimony.

Hey [redacted],

Would one of you reach out to Theresa Acosta, the court reporter for Maxwell's deposition, and ask her to come to the courthouse at lunch? We'd like her to be available in case the defense doesn't stip, as they've agreed to do. Mandy has her number.

Thanks,
