I called and left a voicemail to be here at lunch. She has not called me back yet to confirm I'll call again in a bit.

Hey

Would one of you reach out to Theresa Acosta, the court reporter for Maxwell's deposition, and ask her to come to the courthouse at lunch? We'd like her to be available in case the defense doesn't stip, as they've agreed to do. Mandy has her number.

Thanks,
