Please be reminded that per policy and the T&amp;A Handbook any employee hired for overtime prior to the administrative workweek, is entitled to any applicable night differential in addition to the overtime pay. This results in a notable increase in overtime costs. Therefore, unless otherwise unavoidable, the practice of hiring overtime prior to the administrative work week should be avoided. Specifically, the administrative work week begins at 12:01 am Sunday, so if you hire overtime on Saturday for the following Sunday or beyond, it is scheduled prior to the administrative workweek. The verbiage below is cut and paste from the T&amp;A Handbook, if you have further questions please contact me.

**Regularly Scheduled Overtime.** Overtime (over 8 in a day, over 40 in a week, or over 80 in a pay period), which has been scheduled, both day(s) and hours, prior to the administrative workweek for a specific employee. This overtime must be scheduled before the Sunday of the week in which it was worked to be considered "regularly scheduled." This is the only type of overtime that may be subject to GS night differential, if worked between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M. It is the only type of overtime (besides INS 1931 Act Overtime) that may be paid to recipients of annual premium pay.
