In your email, you state, "I am reminding you." I haven't spoken to you or anyone else regarding the incident involving inmate Epstein or anything else pertaining to August 10, 2019, so how is it possible for you to be reminding me? Second, I'd been properly relieved prior to the incident involving inmate Epstein.

Lt.

I am reminding you to submit your supervisor memorandum for the inmate Epstein incident that occurred on 8/10/19. Please have complete and ready for submission on 8/13/19.

Thank you
