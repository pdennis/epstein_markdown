Please see below. Can you respond? I wouldn't even confirm we have a meeting. If you don't acknowledge that we're even having a meeting, maybe they'll tell us where they heard about it.

Boss,

Hi there,

I am Jillian Gonzales I work for Dr. Oz. I am reaching out in regards to the FBI Briefing being held in NYC on October 23rd for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein.

What is the objective of this briefing? Is this meeting open to the public or the media?

I look forward to your response.

Best,
