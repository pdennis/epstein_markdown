Hey and

Apologies for the short notice -- we're trying to finalize the slides ASAP so Sunny has time to print copies before the end of the day. Would you mind signing off on this soon if you have a few minutes?

Thanks,

Hi and

Attached is a draft powerpoint to go along with the defense closing. It's mostly just some summary slides, but there are a couple exhibits (including a fake photo as suggested).

Thanks,
