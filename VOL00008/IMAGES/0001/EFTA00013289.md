Hi

Our chiefs let us know that you're planning to reach out to defense counsel, and that you had a few questions for us about the current status. Below is the contact information for defense counsel, as well as a brief recap of where we are in our discussions with counsel. Please let us know if any additional information would be useful.

[Redacted] is represented by three attorneys, all of whom have been on our calls over the past months. I don't have direct numbers for them, as I believe they're all working remotely. We emailed them to let them know you were planning to reach out. Here is their contact information:

Susan Necheles:
Kate Cassidy:
Samidh Guha:

We have not heard from them since that date. We emailed them on Monday to check in and have not heard back. Regarding deadlines, we of course defer to your judgment, and have no issue if you decide to extend it when you speak with them.

Thanks very much,

[Redacted]
