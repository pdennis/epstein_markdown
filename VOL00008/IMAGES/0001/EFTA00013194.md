I don't think there's a harm in taking it into evidence, but don't think it's necessary – thoughts?

I reached out to David to see if we want the original ligature used on July 23 to compare to the ligature from August 10th?

Thanks. We spoke with Dr. Graham at OCME, and he said he would set up a phone call between us and Dr. Roman tomorrow, so we can address these issues with her then.

I can answer about determination of time of death- I cannot determine a time of death reliably, especially not within the already tight timeframe that you have already delineated with the phone call and the time found.

Dr,

Is it possible to determine a time or timeframe of death? Additionally, the AUSA office is asking of your findings of the ligature. If possible could you give me a call, may be easier than emailing back and forth. We are working on getting the interviews of those who discovered the body but there are some legalities to that.
