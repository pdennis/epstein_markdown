Hi The ASAIC will be there for the meeting. I think she also will be at the OLEOs.

Let's get together at 1:30. FBI is welcome but let's try to limit it to one representative. Is that o.k.?

I just left you a voicemail, so you can disregard that. We had a very good meeting with on Friday. No one was sure whether you want an FBI presence at the meeting on Friday and thought I should ask you. Could you let me know? And does the meeting with Epstein's team start at 2:00? Is there a plan for a pre-meeting meeting with our folks?

Thanks.
