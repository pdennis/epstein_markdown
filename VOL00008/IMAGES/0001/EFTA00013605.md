Dear

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but I've been incredibly busy since I left paradise in Miami Beach. Just argued an appeal in NY and debated the Mideast at Georgetown. I greatly appreciate your willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position on how he handled Epstein's sentence as long as he didn't get special treatment, but let's put any call off for a while. . Thanks.

Alan
