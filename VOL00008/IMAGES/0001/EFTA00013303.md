Subject: RE: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509

Date: Wed, 30 Dec 2020 18:21:52 +0000

I have reached out to MDC legal counsel to discuss the two emails you sent me today regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. I will reach back out to you once I have had that conversation.

Thank you and Happy New Year,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
New York, NY 10007

Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509

MDC Legal continues to provide inaccurate information.
Contrary to the information provided to you as recited in your email of 12/29-
"MDC legal counsel confirmed that no staff member has ever directed
Ms. Maxwell to remain in a particular location within her isolation cell.
They confirmed that staff understand that no such directions should be given."
last evening (12/29), Ms. Maxwell was instructed by guards not to stand
on either corner of her isolation cell, not to stand to the left or right of the toilet and sink,
and not to stand within 2.5 feet of the door to the cell.
She was told that if she did not comply with this directive, she would receive a disciplinary sanction.

In addition, she is not receiving food designated on the menu.

Further, the discovery disc provided does not work on the MDC computer; and the computer
reports multiple errors indicating it cannot accommodate disc.
Consequently, a replacement disc and/or replacement computer is required.
Please let us know of the status of hard drive containing complete production;

its immediate production could eliminate the disc issue.

Your assistance is appreciated.
