Re: Freedom of Information Act Request No. 2019USMS34199
Subject: Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Requester:

The United States Marshals Service (USMS) is responding to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for agency records pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein.

Pursuant to your request, the USMS conducted a search of its automated files and the District Office in the Southern District of New York and located 73 responsive pages. Of these 73 pages, 3 pages were found to have originated or contained information which originated from the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Those documents have been forwarded to that agency for their review and direct response to you. The remaining 70 pages are being released to you and are attached hereto. Portions of the pages are being withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(6), (b)(7)(C), (b)(7)(E), and (b)(7)(F).

FOIA Exemption (b)(6) allows an agency to withhold personnel, medical, and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Records that apply to or describe a particular individual, including investigative records, qualify as "personnel," "medical," or "similar files" under Exemption 6. FOIA Exemption (b)(7)(C) protects records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that the production of such records or information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. A discretionary release of such records is not appropriate. See United States Department of Justice (DOJ) v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989).

FOIA Exemption (b)(7)(F) protects law enforcement information that "could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F) (2006), amended by OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110175, 121 Stat. 2524. Courts have routinely upheld the use of Exemption (b)(7)(F) to protect the identities of law enforcement agents, as well as protect the names and identifying information of non-law enforcement federal employees, local law enforcement personnel, and other third persons in connection with particular law enforcement matters. See Rugiero v. DOJ, 257 F.3d 534, 552 (6th Cir. 2001); Johnston v. DOJ, No. 97-2173, 1998 WL 518529, *1 (8th Cir. Aug. 10, 1998).

Accordingly, the personally identifiable information of law enforcement officers and government employees was withheld from the responsive documentation. The disclosure of such sensitive information contained in records compiled for law enforcement purposes to the public could subject law enforcement officers and other government personnel to harassment and unwelcome contact. This could disrupt and impede official agency activity, as well as endanger the safety of law enforcement officials. Additionally, the personally identifiable information of third parties named in the records was withheld. The disclosure of third party information could constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and subject the individuals to embarrassment, harassment, and undue public attention. Individuals have a recognized privacy interest in not being publicly associated with law enforcement investigations, not being associated unwarrantedly with alleged criminal activity, and controlling how communications about them are disseminated.

FOIA Exemption (b)(7)(E) exempts from release information that would disclose law enforcement techniques or procedures, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. Public disclosure of information such as internal URLs, codes, and internal identifying numbers could assist unauthorized parties in deciphering the meaning of the codes and numbers, aid in gaining improper access to law enforcement databases, and assist in the unauthorized party’s navigation of these databases. This disclosure of techniques for navigating the databases could permit people seeking to violate the law to gain sensitive knowledge and take preemptive steps to counter actions taken by USMS during investigatory operations. The disclosure of this information serves no public benefit and would not assist the public in understanding how the agency is carrying out its statutory responsibilities.

For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV (2010)). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.

If you are not satisfied with the response to this request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United States Department of Justice, Suite 11050, 1425 New York Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001, or you may submit an appeal through OIP's FOIAonline portal by creating an account on the following web site: https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home. Your appeal must be postmarked or electronically transmitted within 90 days of the date of my response to your request. If you submit your appeal by mail, both the letter and the envelope should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

You may also contact the USMS FOIA Officer or our FOIA Public Liaison at (703) 740-3943 for any further assistance and to discuss any aspect of your request. Additionally, you may contact the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at the National Archives and Records Administration to inquire about the FOIA mediation services they offer.
