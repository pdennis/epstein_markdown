Mr Berman,

Thanks for the shout out, but I'm not a journalist

Iololol

Just a very long list of credible information I have provided to the grossly corrupt SEC et al scumbags Janey, update my various TCR's and derivatives. Separate but related Janey. Separate but related. Hey, is Jay still working on his NITE/VIRT/Sull Crom disclosures?

Jeffrey Epstein's 'Infinite Means' May Be a Mirage

Mr. Epstein, facing sex-trafficking charges, has long been hailed as a financial wizard. He got rich with the help of two wealthy connections, but there is little evidence he's a billionaire.
