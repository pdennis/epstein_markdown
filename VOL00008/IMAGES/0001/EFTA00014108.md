Hi [REDACTED] – clearly thinks I am an idiot. But here is a corrected version of his motion, can you also prepare a proposed order and the file tracking sheet?

Subject: Government's Motion to Seal

In preparation for this afternoon's filing, I have prepared a motion to seal, which is attached. I did not include Epstein's name and made general assertions regarding the confidentiality of the negotiations. Please have someone sign both the motion to seal, and the government's response, for me. We then need to prepare a sealed document tracking sheet, to accompany the motion.

An original and one copy of the sealed document should be placed in two separate envelopes, with the case number written on the outside. An original and one copy of the motion to seal should be filed with the Clerk.

Thanks.
