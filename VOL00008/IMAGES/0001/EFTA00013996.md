Hi guys — I am and I put in a call to Roy Black this morning. He was “unavailable,” so we left a message.

I was approved an immunity request for one of the New York victims/recruiters. It is out so we are going to send it down to you, but I wondered who it should go to first, one of you or how.

Thanks.
