Thank you.

Subject: RE: Relativity access.

We'd like to set up a Relativity database, please, for U.S. v. Epstein, and to grant access to AUSAs.

Currently the only documents we need to have uploaded are in the following folder:

EFTA00013438

JSvEpstein

Investigation\FBI materials (reports, FOIA,

etc)\2018-12-04. FBI Case File

We'd like the PDF files in the folder uploaded but NOT the files in the subfolder (titled "Files combined and manifest"). We also expect to be receiving a large amount of case files in the coming weeks, and so want to get up and running, including agent access, so there's no delay once we receive the large batch of documents.

With respect to anticipate review process, it's possible that at some point we might receive materials that would necessitate a privilege review, but not at this stage and not with respect to the materials in the linked folder.

Please let me know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks very much.
