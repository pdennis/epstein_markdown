Thank you for the call and the update on the Epstein investigation with regard to charging Ghislaine Maxwell.

As I mentioned, [REDACTED] (copied) has been chosen as the permanent ASAC for the NYO's Violent Crime/Gang Branch of the Criminal Division. [REDACTED] will be coordinating with you, [REDACTED], and the rest of the team as we move forward.

To rehash some of the points regarding Maxwell to get [REDACTED] up to speed with the latest:

SDNY is close to a final decision on charging Maxwell regarding her complicity in Epstein’s sex trafficking

FBI believes (as of January) that Maxwell is still living with a friend in the Boston suburb of Manchester by the Sea

Confirmed by historical pen register with cell site location and subpoenas to Amazon for delivery location

Since traditional surveillance, including a pole camera, are not suitable due to the secluded location, and in order to get more recent information, you propose getting a renewed pen register and Amazon subpoena. Additionally, you and the team may seek to get a mail cover.

It was a pleasure working with you, [REDACTED], and the team for the last several months.

Good luck moving forward with the case.

Best regards,

Supervisory Special Agent
FBI New York
