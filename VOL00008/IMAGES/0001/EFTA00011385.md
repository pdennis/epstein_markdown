Per the international travel checklist, I think we need to email you for approval / notice – and I are hoping to get approval to travel to Stockholm, Sweden, between February 3 and 7 to interview a witness in connection with the Epstein investigation. We’ll also separately put in phone requests, but please let us know if you need any additional information or materials.

thanks very much,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
