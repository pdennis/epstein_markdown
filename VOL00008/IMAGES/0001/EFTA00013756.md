Messrs. Lewis and

Judge Davis tried to reach you this afternoon, but was unsuccessful. He wanted you to know that he has chosen Aaron Podhurst and Robert Josefberg to handle this matter and they have agreed. He left a message on voice mail today to that effect.

If there is any disagreement with his choice, please advise. The Judge is undergoing surgery on his foot Monday morning, but you can e-mail to let me know your decision.

Have a nice holiday.
