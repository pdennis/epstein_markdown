Hi all,

Following up on this, can you let me know whether we're on track for this deadline? Apologies for pestering, but we'll need to make this deadline in order to meet our court-ordered 3500 deadline.

Thanks very much,

Hi [redacted] and [redacted]

And I spoke about this today, but I wanted to recap our conversation in an email so that everyone is on the same page about what types of communications we'll need you to gather. As we discussed, we would like to receive these materials no later than September 15th, so that we have enough time to review and process them for 3500 productions. I'll send around a calendar invitation so that everyone can keep track of the deadline. There are two categories of materials to gather:

- For [redacted], and anyone else at C20 or working with C20 (including victim specialists in New York or elsewhere):
- We will need any and all communications with witnesses, or attorneys for witnesses.
- This includes all electronic communications, including emails and text messages.
- We will need these materials for all witnesses, regardless of whether they are testifying or not, and regardless of whether they were part of the Maxwell phase of the investigation.

- For [redacted] and [redacted]:
- We will need all of their communications, reports, or other writings about the Epstein/Maxwell investigation, both internal and external.
- We will need all forms of electronic communications – documents, emails, text messages, chats/instant messages, or anything else.
- This also includes any type of report or notes (formal or informal) in connection with this case.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
