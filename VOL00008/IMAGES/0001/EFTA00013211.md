Sure – how is tomorrow at 10 or, alternatively, 2?

I think it’s probably easier to discuss in real time rather than email, unless you prefer otherwise, but the short answer is that we keyed in on these individuals as well as another 3-5 or so, for substantially similar reasons as you’ve identified. Want to chat about these individuals sometime today or tomorrow?

In my earlier review of some of the old Epstein 302s and grand jury testimony, I identified the below names as potentially significant victim witnesses for various reasons – some being the age, some being conduct that went well beyond massages, etc. Can you tell me which if any we have attempted to engage and, for those we have not, thoughts on whether to?
