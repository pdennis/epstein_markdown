Jay,

Can't speak tonight. Won't send it out tonight. I'll check with Alex in the morning and will call you then.

- I have to leave the office shortly, but please let me know if you want to set up a time to speak regarding your letter to Judge Davis. As you can see from my email earlier, we actually only have a few limited areas of disagreement with your letter. I would hope you would not send it out before we have a chance to speak.

Regarding the addendum to the contract, I am getting the appropriate signatures and will send them tomorrow.

Best, Jay
