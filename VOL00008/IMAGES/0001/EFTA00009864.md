Subject: Tartaglione document request

Hi

[REDACTED]

A while back, we spoke about obtaining a final copy of the BOP’s Psychological Reconstruction of Inmate Jeffrey Epstein and the MCC’s response so that we can evaluate what discovery obligations we have with respect to the document for purposes of the capital phase of Tartaglione’s trial. Have you been able to locate the document, and if so, can you please email to us when you have a chance?

Many thanks,
