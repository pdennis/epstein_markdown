IN RE:

SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATION

# MOTION TO FILE DOCUMENTS UNDER SEAL

The United States of America, by and through the undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, hereby moves to seal its Application for Search Warrant for the following reasons:

1. The attached documents contain information relating to an ongoing grand jury investigation; thus, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(6), all records and orders related to the grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before the grand jury.

2. Public disclosure of this matter would jeopardize the criminal investigation, notify potential subjects and/or targets and undermine the public interest and the function of the grand jury.

WHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that the aforementioned documents be sealed.

Respectfully submitted,

R. ALEXANDER ACOSTA
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
