Man arrested on Upper East Side with SUV loaded with ammo, shotgun in aftermath of Capitol siege

A man was arrested on the Upper East Side Wednesday with an arsenal of ammunition, a shotgun and other tactical items in his SUV in connection with the ongoing raids surrounding the siege of the Capitol, according to documents in the vehicle and a law enforcement official.

Samuel Fisher was arrested near E. 89th St. and York Ave. on unspecified charges related to the Jan. 6 siege. He was awaiting arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court.

A search warrant return - a document which lists what was seized in a search - visible in the Chevrolet 1500 Tahoe SUV listed the shotgun, six cases of shotgun shells, 12 boxes of .9-mm ammunition, a black tactical vest with a loaded clip, eight more loaded clips, a second vest with ballistic plates and a knife, and two machetes.

Members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force huddled around Fisher's SUV as cops blocked E. 88th St. after making the arrest. Video from the scene showed an FBI officer carrying the shotgun seized from the SUV to an evidence van.

Also spotted in the car were an American flag, a copy of the Daily News with President Trump's face on it, an emergency poncho and B12 vitamins.

It wasn't immediately clear if Fisher is accused of being part of the Capitol siege or was arrested purely for online activity. A second man, Patrick Edward McCaughey III, was arrested Tuesday night in the upstate town of South Salem. He is in custody and will be arraigned later Wednesday in White Plains Federal Court.

McCaughey is charged with using a riot shield to press against a Capitol police officer shown on video screaming as he's squeezed between a door in the midst of a violent confrontation with rioters at a key entry point in the Capitol, law enforcement sources said. The arrests followed dozens of others across the nation as federal authorities seek to hold people who stormed the Capitol responsible for their conduct, as well as anyone making online threats to kill elected officials. Five people died in the Capitol riot, including a police officer, in the hours-long siege that took place after President Trump extorted a crowd to march to the Capitol. The unrest came as Congress was certifying the electoral college votes that won Sen. Joe Biden the presidency.

Terror cells in Indonesia continue to recruit and plot attacks amid COVID-19 - As Indonesia grapples with the impact of COVID-19, terrorism cells in the country continue to spread radical messages, actively seeking new recruits and plotting their next attacks, a senior counterterrorism official said.

In an exclusive interview with CNA, the National Counter Terrorism Agency's (BNPT) director for enforcement, Eddy Hartono said although there has been no major terrorist attack during the pandemic, terrorism cells in Indonesia "are not sitting back and relaxing."

"They are actively recruiting, spreading their ideology, raising funds and conducting training," the Brigadier General said, adding that the only thing that has slowed during the pandemic is the sending of militants to join the ranks of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The police's counterterrorism unit Densus 88 arrested a total of 232 people last year for alleged involvement in terrorism activities.

"They are indeed planning attacks on security officials, state institutions, military and the police," Mr Hartono said. "Thank goodness we have been able to prevent (these attacks) from happening."

Among those who were arrested last year were two of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists Zulkarnaen and Upik Lawanga who have evaded capture for 19 and 14 years respectively.

Zulkarnaen, who goes by one name, was believed to be behind at least three terror attacks, including the 2002 Bali Bombings while Upik Lawanga was suspected of aiding a series of terror attacks between 2004 and 2006. Zulkarnaen was arrested in December and Lawanga was arrested in November...

A major area of focus was the increasing trend of terrorists using localized financing, otherwise known as "funding in place."

(U) Whereas al-Qa'ida historically financed its affiliate groups and actors from afar, sending money for recruitment, transportation, training, etc., terrorist groups today are less reliant on funding from group leadership. "Funding in place" not only provides a layer of security by not having to worry about financial and intelligence tools interrupting funding streams, but also makes it significantly harder to detect possible terrorist financing scenarios and future attack plans.

# U.S. Lawmakers Aim To Curtail Face Recognition Even As The Technology IDs Capitol Attackers [Reuters] WFO/Multiple Field Offices

- Researchers and law enforcement have been running photographs from the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol through facial recognition, which looks for similar faces in databases of mugshots, social media headshots or other images.

## 'No Plan, No Q, Nothing': QAnon Followers Reel As Biden Inaugurated [Reuters] multiple field offices

- On Wednesday [Jan. 20], QAnon adherents grappled with a harsh reality check: Trump had left office with no mass arrests or other victories against the supposed cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophile cannibal elites, especially Democrats, he was ostensibly fighting.
- In one Telegram channel with more than 18,400 members, QAnon believers were split between those still urging others to 'trust the plan' and those saying they felt betrayed. "It's obvious now we've been had. No plan, no Q, nothing," wrote one user.
- Some messages referenced theories that a coup was going to take place before the end of Inauguration Day. Others moved the goalposts again, speculating that Trump would be sworn into office on Mar. 4.
