Thanks, this is helpful. I don't think we need this yet but we'll reach back out if we do.

Expanding on this a little, I believe her name is _______________ – or at least that's how she's listed on travel records. We have a breakdown of airline tickets purchased with any AmEx card associated with Epstein, which is how he primarily booked flights for others (which he did constantly; we have records of more than 4,800 flights that he purchased in the past ten years). There are hundreds of flight ticket records for _______________ dating from 2011 up to as recently as last month.

Let us know if you want those records; the file is too big to email, but we can add you to the share drive or I can put it in the share of a case that _______________ and I have together so you can pull it over to your share if you have a different one and want a separate copy.

Here are the incident reports from the last incident. _______________ came up during arrest planning—I remember the agents telling me she was flying with Epstein recently, but I don't remember if they sent me records. I just took a look at the travel docs we have, and I'm not seeing anything.

Do you have a name for the ex-wife? Nothing comes to mind immediately.

In addition, could you forward anything you have (travel records, etc) about _______________? And do you know who her ex-wife is? She is supposedly also connected to Epstein. Thanks.

Did you receive any reports from BOP relating to the July 23 incident, or any documentation afterward regarding suicide watch? Any notes of communications with anyone at BOP regarding the incident? If so, can you forward?
