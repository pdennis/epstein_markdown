Hi all,

Attached please find the completed research on the next 40 jurors and typed-up VD notes from [REDACTED] and me. Green highlight indicates starting juror #117 and the 40th juror is highlighted in yellow.

Saved here on the Shared as well.

Best,

[REDACTED] If you could please get through the next 40 jurors tonight so the team has whatever research you can find for voir dire tomorrow, that would be great. Thank you so much!

Subject: Outside juror research

Hi team,

[REDACTED] have been looking into the jurors proceeding to voir dire (excluding those that were struck today) online, with many thanks to them. A sample of their notes is attached (which hasn't yet been corroborated by the notes I took today, which I've sent them—for example, if there's two people with the same name, my notes from today should narrow it down).

Can you please let [REDACTED] know what would be most helpful to you in advance of tomorrow (e.g., how many jurors you want them to get through, by what time, etc.)?

Thanks,
