Hi Jim,

I'm writing a story off of yesterday's Maxwell hearing before the 2nd Circuit. Sorry for late notice, this just came together.

I'm told that the "Court 2" that denied SDNY access to the case file was Judge Koetl on the [redacted] case.

Can you offer any insight into what differentiates the [redacted] case from the [redacted] case?

I'm told Maxwell was deposed in the [redacted] case. And I note that [redacted] are defendants.

Is it fair to say that Koetl's ruling was a fortunate break for Maxwell, [redacted]?

Thanks,
