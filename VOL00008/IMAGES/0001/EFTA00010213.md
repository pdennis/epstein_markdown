Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for another witness in the Maxwell trial—[redacted]. I expect he’ll testify on 12/8, but he could possible bleed over into 12/9. I need to prep with him on 12/7, and he’s not vaccinated, so we’ll need to get him a COVID test before he can testify. Given that plan, I’d like to have him fly in the evening of 12/6 and out on the evening of 12/9.

It is very important that [redacted] not run into [redacted] or any of their family, [redacted] is [redacted] ex, and they do not know that [redacted] is coming up to NY to testify. So would you please make sure that [redacted] stays at a hotel that is far away from anywhere you might put [redacted] and their kids?

Thanks so much,

EFTA00010213
