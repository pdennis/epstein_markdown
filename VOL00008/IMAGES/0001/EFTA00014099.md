Alex told me this morning that Epstein had pled. That is wonderful. I never thought we'd see the day. You deserve all the credit for this. If it had not been for you, he would have gotten away with it.

But my nemesis Mr. Epstein finally pled. The first article is my favorite. Thank you, as always, for your help and support. I am still in a state of shock.
