Here are the documents that I have electronically. The "Jeffrey Epstein Archives" document has several stories contained within it.

I do not have the letter that the Chief handed out, but some of these stories reference the letter. I do not believe that the letter mentioned any specifics. But, when the State Attorney's Office basically shut down the case, the Chief deemed the police investigation "closed," which meant that the PC affidavits for the arrests of Epstein, [redacted], and [redacted] became public. "The Smoking Gun" published the redacted PC affidavits and later published a portion of the Incident Report. Here are links to their stories.
