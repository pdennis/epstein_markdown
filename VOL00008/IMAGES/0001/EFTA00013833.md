Hi all – I spoke with someone from the Florida Bar this afternoon. She told me that they would be issuing a written opinion by the end of the week that was essentially a “non-opinion.” In other words, the letter will say that she cannot advise us regarding our victim notification obligations under federal law. She did, however, tell me that the solicitation rules don’t apply to our Office in a situation like this because we are not soliciting employment from the victims. I asked about whether the Office had reached a decision regarding Mr. Josefsberg’s related inquiry, but she would not provide me with any information, citing the Bar’s confidentiality rules.

I am going to wait to hear from Mr. Josefsberg or Ms. Ezell regarding the response they receive from the Bar before I send out the final batch of letters so that I can revise them if necessary.

On another note, Dexter, have you heard anything from Mr. Edwards regarding the resolution of the Doe v. United States case?
