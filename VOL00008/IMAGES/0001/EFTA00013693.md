Hi — This is not meant as pestering. I just know that the Miami paper hasn't covered Epstein like they have up here. This is a link to a site that, for some unknown reason, has compiled most of the "legitimate" newspaper stories about Epstein. It does not contain the recent story in the London newspapers about Epstein's link to Prince Andrew. If you want a link to that story, let me know. [As an aside about the London article/leak issue, the day after we put a key witness in the grand jury, a London reporter called the witness' attorney to ask whether his client had appeared before the grand jury yet. So wherever the leak is, it is of international proportions.]
