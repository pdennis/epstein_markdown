Just received a call from [REDACTED] One of Epstein’s private investigators, Robert Myers, has been trying to track down one of our victims for several days and finally caught up with her today. She told him that she did not want to talk to him and he then told her that, if she wouldn’t talk to him, her name would somehow appear in the press and she should think about how that will affect her. [REDACTED] put the victim in touch with one of our pro bono lawyers, and also informed her of her right to contact the police if she feels she is being threatened or harassed.

In the meantime, this is the latest New York press coverage of Mr. Epstein:

## Just Visiting

JEFFREY Epstein - who's facing jail time for soliciting prostitutes, some of whom were under the age of 18 - isn't feeling the love stateside, so he's skipped the country (temporarily, we're assured) to feel the love in Israel. A rep said Epstein, who was spotted at the Tel Aviv Hilton over the weekend, "is in Israel for Passover. He's meeting with Israeli scientists about medical research he's funding and taking a tour of military bases with [Friends of Israel chairman] Benny Shabtai." As for his ongoing legal troubles, the rep added, "It should be noted that the alleged victims have all acknowledged they lied about their age."
