Hi

Next week, the team on our Jeffrey Epstein investigation (we can fill you in more at 3 pm) is traveling to Florida to meet with the case agents on the original Epstein investigation and begin the process of collecting the hard copy files from that investigation.

Not a prospective update, but today, Victor Casado, a former supervisory guard at the MCC, was sentenced to 36 months for his role in smuggling contraband into the MCC for [redacted] in exchange for tens of thousands of dollars in bribes.

Same request. Hopefully soon I'll be in the loop enough that I won't have to ask this, but for the time being, please bear with me. Thanks!

Just so I have a sense, can you shoot me an email about any significant events (pleas, sentencings, hearings, significant meetings, etc.) that will be happening next week? I don't need detail – just a brief description of the event so it is on my

radar screen. Thanks.
