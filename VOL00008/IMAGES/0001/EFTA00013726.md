Hi all – So sorry to bother you on a Saturday, but I am hoping that I can persuade you to reach out to [redacted] about Epstein’s investigators harassing the girls. [redacted] received a frantic call today about Epstein’s investigators bothering the parents of one of the victims. According to the victim, he demanded to see the victim and when he saw her, he told the victim that they had video of the girl and were planning to put it on the internet. We don’t believe that Epstein actually has video of any of the girls, and [redacted] has calmed the girl down, but this activity seems to be getting more aggressive. Remember also that Epstein is using the state criminal case to subpoena depositions of victims in the federal case (who are not part of the state indictment) to get information about our investigation. These actions do not seem consistent with what Epstein’s attorneys are supposed to be trying to work out with [redacted] in DC. Any chance [redacted] will ask Epstein’s people to call off their dogs until he makes his decision?
