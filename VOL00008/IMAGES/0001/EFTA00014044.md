P.S. – The Saturday before his plea and sentencing Goldberger specifically told me that he would not get work release. So did Roy.

He is hanging out at his lawyer’s office during the day, eating a lovely lunch, and getting driven back to the campgrounds at night. He is allegedly working for the “Florida Science Foundation” which exists only to employ Epstein. Its offices are conveniently located 3 buildings down from me at Goldberger’s office.

Work release? What the hell is that? Where does he sleep at night and what is he doing?

Subject: Epstein is out on work release

The Colonel just stopped by to see [redacted] and told her that Epstein has been out on work release for the past few weeks.

Can I indict him now?
