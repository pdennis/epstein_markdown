I have received a couple of calls and an e-mail from Lilly Ann Sanchez asking for an extension of time to respond to several subpoena. She also states that they intend to provide us with a “supplement” to their presentation and what they believe will be their resolution with the state. I intend to send a response stating that the subpoenas for financial documents can be put off, but we want to get the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant as soon as possible. I also intend to invite her to call me to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could include concurrent time.

If anyone has communicated anything to any of Epstein’s attorneys that is contrary to this, please contact my assistant, [redacted] as soon as possible. I have asked [redacted] to send out the e-mail while I am in trial. You will all receive a copy of the e-mail when it is sent.

Thank you.
