Subject: Epstein-related docs released by Second Circuit
Date: Fri, 09 Aug 2019 15:43:03 +0000

Just FYI for everybody, today the Second Circuit has unsealed (and posted) a ton of documents from the [redacted] v. Ghislaine Maxwell libel lawsuit, so there likely will be a ton of reporting on that. Any reference to those newly-unsealed documents are separate from—and do not include—any filings we've made, and are independent of our case.

(We have been aware of the litigation and generally aware of the filings, though it also won't hurt to have a bunch of journalists combing through them and reporting out interesting elements.)

Anyway just wanted to note that there's likely to be a flood of attention to this development but that it's not anything new specifically from our investigation.
