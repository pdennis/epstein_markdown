Hi

Attached is the scheduling order with the public dial in information (there is no video). In addition to the public access line, the Court has set up a different access line for victims who want to attend-- if you'd like me to, I can let the Court know you plan to dial in, so that I can send you the victim access line. Just let me know your preference.

Thanks,

From
