Dear Mr. Scarola: I have attached the Non-Prosecution Agreement. Please restrict its disclosure only to those who have reviewed and signed the Protective Order. If any other staff members or attorneys need to see this document, please have them review and sign the Protective Order and send it to me. Thank you.
