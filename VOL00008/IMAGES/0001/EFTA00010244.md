Hey team,

Since [redacted] won't be in court tomorrow, I have reassigned the juror questionnaires for you guys to take on. The new ones start at row 71 (juror 199), with the one exception that I also reassigned [redacted] rows 39 and 40 (the last two from [redacted] first batch we didn't get to today).

[redacted] "I'll print yours out so we have the same hard copy notes method. [redacted] since I didn't get this done before you headed out, if you want to take notes in the spreadsheet attached and send to me by 7:45am tomorrow, I can print it out in the morning (but obviously do what's best for you note taking wise, I'm happy to accommodate however I can).

Thanks.
