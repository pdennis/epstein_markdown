I would construe the request as one under the FOIA, and route it to [REDACTED]. As to the letter, I have not sent it out, since I was on military leave on Oct 22-26. I will get it out this week.

Subject: Letter re Epstein

Hi [REDACTED] - I received a letter addressed to the “Records Custodian” for the U.S. Attorney’s Office making a “public records request for the entire file.” FOIA is not referenced in the letter. Should I do anything with this letter or respond in any way?

Also, have you heard anything back from Mr. Edwards regarding your latest correspondence?

Thank you.
