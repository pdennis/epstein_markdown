Hey [Redacted] Sorry I missed your call back. I tried you again later yesterday but we couldn't connect. No huge rush – can we speak Monday morning? If so, what's a good time?

In the meantime, it would help if you could email me a copy of the [Redacted]. I think all I have is a hard copy which I believe I left back at the office before we were ordered to work at home.

Thank you and enjoy the weekend.
