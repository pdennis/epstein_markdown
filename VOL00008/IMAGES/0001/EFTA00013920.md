, are you back? We need to spend some time together on the indictment. I was planning on Monday because I thought you were back that day but if you're already back let me know. By the way, and Alex have been very clear that we are not negotiating with this guy any more in any way.

Thx.

Hi , sent me an email about epstein wanting to do less time. I hope that his request will be denied. The original deal was supposed to be 2 years so he has already gotten a big break. Plus we have identified more victims since we agreed to the 18 months. Please keep me posted. Thanks.
