Good afternoon, ___________________________.

Could you please provide me with the name and contact information for your press official in charge of handling matters related to Epstein. I would like to connect them with our Director of Public Affairs, Aja Worthy-Davis, who is responding to press inquiries for us.

Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,
