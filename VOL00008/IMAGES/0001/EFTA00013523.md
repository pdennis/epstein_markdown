Hi ☐ Here is my suggestion:

Dear ☐ The FBI has informed us that a case disposition conference has been set in the Epstein case on January 7, 2008. Our agreement with Mr. Epstein contemplated a simultaneous plea and sentencing for October (or, as we later agreed, November), followed by Mr. Epstein self-surrendering to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008. From your last e-mail, it appeared that the judge was under the impression that Mr. Epstein could not be sentenced before January 2008. We are hoping that Judge McSorley would consider conducting the simultaneous plea and sentencing some time before January 4, 2008, so that Mr. Epstein can comply with the terms of our agreement and begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008.

I also would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the plea agreement, the Information that you plan to file (if it hasn't been filed already), and any factual proffer or other documents related to the plea. Please also let me know the date and time of the plea and sentencing so that someone from our office can attend and insure Mr. Epstein's compliance with the terms of his federal non-prosecution agreement.

If you need any information regarding the federal investigation, or if you have any questions about the terms of the federal non-prosecution agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number below or ☐ in the West Palm Beach office.

Thank you.
