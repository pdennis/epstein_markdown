The vendor has the data and is working on the upload. We had to remove the old data first. As soon as the data has been uploaded I will let you know.

Thank you

Not a problem. I will have the vendor remove the data from Relativity and replace it with this new data set. I will let you know if there are any questions.

Thank you.

Hello

It took a while to get this data off of their FTP site but I was able to download all of this data from the vendor. I am assuming that you would like to remove the Florida scanned data that is currently in Relativity and replace it with the new data that the vendor sent to us correct?

Thank you.

Good morning,

I'm trying to send you the portal access again. I went ahead and had all of the data uploaded into this portal for you - please let me know if you don't prefer this access and I will add to a hard drive and overnight it instead.
