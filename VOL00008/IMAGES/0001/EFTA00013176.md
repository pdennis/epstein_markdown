I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named [redacted] (phonetic) who claimed to be an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body. [redacted] left his phone number as [redacted].

Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate.

(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)

Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.

thank you,

Hi

MCC Administrators have been in touch with [REDACTED] at the USMS since early this morning. I too have been in touch with [REDACTED] since a little after 9 am, at which time I shared the limited information I had. The press release is the sum total of the information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is more information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further since it is an open investigation.

Thank you,

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone?

I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise.

Thank you.

As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

Thank you,

FYI:

The BOP just informed us that Epstein is being taken by ambulance to the hospital from another apparent suicide attempt- no other information was provided.

They will update us as more info becomes available.
