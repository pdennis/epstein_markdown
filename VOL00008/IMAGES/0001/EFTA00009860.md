Thank you very much for looking into this and for all of your help. For now, we would like to look into having a vendor scan the entire file and make copies of any CDs and cassette tapes in the files. Would you be able to send us the names of vendors you have used in the past please?

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney

Sorry it took time to get back to you. In answer to the questions from the call.

1. You are welcome to come to our office in West Palm Beach. We can set up a floor where you will be reasonably alone and can safely scan materials. There is a Marriott within a block of our office if you decide to come.
2. Turns out we cancelled our copy service earlier this year and never got it going again due to Covid. I can get names of vendors we used in the past if you want to go that route.
3. There are cds and cassette tape in the materials according to the legal assistant that has done the inventory.

Feel free to contact me with any other questions.

Best regards

Hello [REDACTED],

I can do a call this afternoon. Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow during the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don’t work, let me know and we will work out an alternate time.

In the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR has their own inventory of the materials.

When OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the documents that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the time on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well.

A copy of our inventory is attached.

I look forward to assisting you in this matter.

Best regards,

Managing Assistant United States Attorney
West Palm Beach Regional Office – SDFL

We supervise the team in New York that is currently prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell, and suggested we reach out to you. As discussed briefly with , we are hoping to locate the boxes of documents and other records regarding the prior SDFL investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators that we understand are currently being stored in the West Palm Beach office. In particular, we would like to make arrangements to review and scan those materials in connection with our own case, and suggested that we touch base with you on how best to do so.

I've copied the trial team here. Please let us know if you have time for a call in the near future to discuss further. Alternatively, if there is a more appropriate point of contact on this issue, please feel free to point us in that direction.

Thanks very much.
