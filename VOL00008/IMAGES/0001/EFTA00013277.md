Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509

Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell (02879-509) write to report that she was physically mistreated and verbally threatened by MDC staff over the weekend.

Officer (sp) performed a body search of Ms. Maxwell inside her isolation cell with her back to the handheld camera.

During the search, Officer squeezed Ms. Maxwell’s breast with vice-like pressure equivalent to a mammography.

Ms. Maxwell physically recoiled in response to pain caused by Officer. Another guard, Officer (sp) threatened to charge Ms. Maxwell with "assaulting an officer" should she move again during a search of her person.

Ms. Maxwell reported the physical incident to a staff psychologist and to an associate warden and was examined by medical staff. In addition to written reports, the physical and verbal incidents should have been captured on the handheld camera, used constantly to surveil Ms. Maxwell.

This is not the first time Ms. Maxwell has been touched inappropriately by MDC staff, as MDC records should reflect.

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell make this report to put the MDC on notice:

Should Ms. Maxwell be further assaulted and threatened, we will file an official complaint with the Attorney General’s Office and notify the Court. This will further blemish the BOP's reputation, already tarnished by negligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The restrictive conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention in the MDC correlate directly to the Epstein debacle in the MCC, making unprovoked rough treatment of Ms. Maxwell baffling.

Be further advised, should Ms. Maxwell face any retaliation as a result of this email, this too will be promptly reported.
