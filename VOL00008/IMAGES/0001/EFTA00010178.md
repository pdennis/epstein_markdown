I've added it to the pending Rule 16 production and have saved it to the trial subpoena returns folder here: \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Trial\Trial Subpoena Returns\Amazon\2021.11.10

Let me know if you want this pending Rule 16 production prepped to go out today with the 3500 and GX (right now the pending production just has these Amazon returns).

Hey and S

Thanks again for all the help today! When you have a chance, would one of you mind adding this to the next Discovery folder and to a folder for Amazon subpoena returns?
