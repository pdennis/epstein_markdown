Hi Florence,

Yes as to (a). We produced the autopsy report to (b) but they have not published it yet.

I’m also copying the prosecutor on the [redacted] case, [redacted], who should be able to be a contact for you in anything related to Epstein for the near term, as I’m planning to be out [redacted].

Thank you,

Hi

I hope all is well, and that you're staying both dry and safe these days.

We received a request for Epstein's toxicology report from someone who appears to be a member of the public. Before we respond, I want to confirm (a) that the federal investigation into Epstein's death has concluded, at least insofar as we would need to withhold documents on the basis of any ongoing investigation, and (b) whether you know if the NYT has published any of the redacted autopsy report that your office provided to them.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,

Florence Hutner

Florence,

The redacted autopsy reported, as produced to the Times, is attached. I provided notice to Mark Epstein's attorney this morning.

Have a good holiday weekend.

Hi Florence,

Following up on our call yesterday, we will send you a copy of the redacted autopsy report tomorrow, after it's produced. We also intend to call Mark Epstein's lawyer tomorrow morning to give her a courtesy head's up about the release.

Thanks,
