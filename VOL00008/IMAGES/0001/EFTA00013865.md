Marie that is a good time. I also want to conference Jack Goldberger into the call. This will be a wrap up call. Roy

Dear Roy:

Epstein matter. I am forwarding to you an e-mail that I sent to Jay Lefkowitz last night.

and I can call you at 3:30 to speak about your list of issues. If that time does not work, please let me know what times you are available.

Thank you.

Subject: Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Mr. Lefkowitz:

I understand that the Deputy Attorney General has completed his review of the Epstein matter and has determined that federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein's case is appropriate.

Accordingly, Mr. Epstein has until the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement between the United States and Mr. Epstein (as modified by the U.S. Attorney's December 19th letter to [redacted]), including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to begin his sentence of imprisonment.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the number shown below.
