requested my help in sending this out:

This should only take around 5 minutes:

- Please review the list of assets on the last page of the attached (criminal or civil, depending on your division) and type in the asset code number(s) next to any case of yours that may affect that asset or involve a given law firm). (Use Adobe's Type Text Comment tool to type.)
- If you have no hits, please type "nothing to report" at the top of the form.
Save the annotated report and email it back to my secretary, Jeanette Grayeb,

Thanks!
