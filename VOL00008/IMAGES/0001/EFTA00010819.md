Per below: the prolific Bag Man Terren Peizer and his felon Partner Michael Wachs: Crede. Peizer criminally obstructed justice for the Mogilevich Bag Man: Milken along with current Goldman CEO DJDsol.

Peizer in NETE as well as FreeSeas with fellow Bag Man Joshie Sason. Along with Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. FreeSeas is Newlead 2.0. A not so distant cousin: TopShips. ALL in related TCR's of mine where NITE was a top trader. AND before the SDNY Courts in separate but related actions. Felon Wachs ex wife: Esousa. Wachs sister Cobblestone. BOTH NETE as well. In fact, it was Esousa/Cobblestone entities used to "assign" RBL/Northern Leasing notes in NETE so that the SEC facilitated reverse merger between NETE and MULN could take place. These "assignments" were the mechanism to "TRANSFER" the massive NETE money laundering "payment processing" business to RBL/Northern Leasing. Guaranteeing Northern Leasing is up and running today as a result. Despite the NY Supreme Courts/NYAG rulings to shut it down.

I have attached my IRS TCR filed with Berger Montague. The IRS TCR was based on the SEC TCR. It was WHY IRS CI agents Vikas Arora and Nate Sarnacki flew to Denver from Chicago in April 2016 to meet with me. Berger submitted my IRS TCR shortly after submitting my SEC TCR in March 2013. As you can clearly see and as the record of extensive correspondence (including IG Hoecker) clearly shows: the SEC/FINRA/FINCEN UBS AML complaint for which Norberg, Pasquinelli, Knowles, Wardlay issued their fraud denial WHILE I was still waiting for my Opco Denial appeal: The Opco trading data ALSO implicates UBS as well as NITE: SEC OWB/IG Hoecker FRAUD: "Enforcement staff never saw Mr Dilorio's information" FinCEN Assesses $14.5 Million Penalty against UBS Financial Services for Anti-Money Laundering Failures | FinCEN.gov

# FinCEN Assesses $14.5 Million Penalty against UBS Financial Services for Anti-Money Laundering Failures | FinCEN.gov

WASHINGTON—The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today announced an assessment against UBS Financial Services, Inc. (UBSFS) for willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). FinCEN assessed a $14.5 million civil money penalty, of which $5 million will be paid to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the remainder will be concurrent with penalties for similar or related ...

www.fincen.gov

The blatant, and egregious disregard by NITE/UBSS at all in trading billions of shares of sham companies with no products, nothing but losses, reverse merger, repeat explained: illegal naked shorting facilitates ALL of it. Very profitable. Virtually riskless. Further, as I ask in my information: WHEN would NITE,UBSS, CDEL etc file a SAR? BEFORE or AFTER trading billions of shares??? There ARE NO SAR's. This also would fall under the jurisdiction of Kevin Goodman. This is the IRS TCR: money laundering/tax evasion related to this illegal naked shorting. In it, I discuss the Economic Substance Theory. WHY do sophisticated investors like the ones I have detailed extensively bother "investing" in these sham companies?? Take Mr Goodman's et al Parallax "Covid complaint" and the OTHER sham shells I detail below. In fact, take the SEC OWN WORDS in the Parallax complaint: Parallax had no products AND no money in Early 2020 when Arena/Bradly made their bogus claims. What did they have? The same thing I detail in my extensive correspondence: ALL of these money laundering shells have worthless certificates. Usually converted from bogus, fictitious promissory notes. Then dumped on the public by a WILLING executing BD/MM like NITE,UBSS,CDEL etc. AND, converted into real money. The BD/MM are compensated in the form of illegal naked shorting trading profits. This is and always has been the core business at NITE et al. Unfortunately: the effects of which are sitting on the NITE balance sheet as we speak. This is why my claims have been criminally obstructed by the SEC. The SEC has REPEATEDLY bailed out a known criminal enterprise. This is why Goodman produced the bullshit "order handling" complaint almost 6 months after I sent him my TCR in July 2015. This is why ALL of the related entities are omitted in his Parallax complaint. The SEC admits also repeatedly admits that shams like Parallax are money laundering shells. WHY? Just ask who trades them.

In Parallax Goodman, the SEC et al acknowledge Parallax as a money laundering shell. Yet no AML complaint. NITE top trader?

To further prove my point: The SEC approved Parallax S1: June 2019 with sellers I detailed below. Yet, in early 2020, the SEC acknowledges Parallax had no money to support their "new product" claims. HOW CAN THIS BE? As with hundreds of money laundering shells/NITE/UBSS et al top traded: These sophisticated investors are NOT "investing". They are LAUNDERING.

And with bullshit "order handling", "front running", stand alone "P&amp;D" (per my TCR: just a tool used to facilitate the laundering/naked shorting), "market access", "Covid disclosures", etc etc complaints, the SEC guarantees the activity will continue.

It does in July 2021.

EFTA00010830

No doubt a deterrent from the BD SRO FINRA where the salaries of employees are paid by the criminals they "oversee".

What an absolute farce of an enforcement deterrent the BD SRO FINRA is. Goodman is the PERFECT fit as the FINRA Overlord at the SEC. This bullshit "COVID 19 disclosure" complaint brought by the SEC/FINRA/Goodman et al is yet another example of SEC obstruction and corruption. Like "front running", "order handling", "market access", "stand alone P&amp;D", etc etc etc. NOT a deterrent. Intentionally. So the criminal activity can continue. Because the criminals OWN the SEC/FINRA. This is why the SEC has outsourced the entire OTCM to FINRA. Including short interest reporting, issuer corporate actions: reverse splits, and compliance with the BSA. Judge Oetken et al: The reason SEC IG Hoecker and his "bosses" at the SEC don't want to meet with me despite my many offers to do so (same goes for DoJ/FBI): I would absolutely HUMILIATE them.

SDNY, NY Supreme Court, NJ Judges et al

to say the SEC is a grossly corrupt, criminal enterprise ACTIVELY facilitating multiple, massive, ongoing frauds on the public to the benefit of the criminals who own them while screwing the whistleblower who caught them: me. The real world implications of this irrefutable FACT are staggering. REAL lives changed/ruined. Staggering losses for "main street investors" as Clayton referred to them. Because, for ANYONE spending more than an hour or 2 on a trading desk: Gordon Gekko was right: "It's a zero sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses". The Grossly corrupt SEC has rigged the game in favor of the criminals over the public it is mandated to protect. Mr Paley, did your Micro Cap Fraud Task Force actually accomplish ANYTHING? How did 4+ TRILLION shares of OTCM money laundering shells trade in 1Q 2021? Are prolific Bag Men like Kramer and Honig etc etc actually "out of business"?

RIOT is Honig/Russian money laundering shell

RIOT does "offering" with SBNY as escrow agent and the criminal law firm Sichenzia Ross.

Northern Data trades OTCM Pinks: no info

Northern Data now owns 12% of RIOT

RIOT is a "customer" of Beijing based Bitmain which has been effectively shut down by the PRC

Bitmain filed a "secret ipo" with Clayton/SEC

RIOT is a National security risk and ONGOING fraud on the public kept up and running by the grossly corrupt SEC: Gottschall et al

# Bitmain

Mr Gottschall: And to think ALL of this is happening 15 from my home in Castle Rock Colorado. Too fucking funny.

EFTA00010838

SDNY, NY Supreme Courts/NJ Courts grossly corrupt SEC et al,

Let's break down VIRT CEO Dougie "Mr Transparency" Cifu comments to Sell Side analysts on the NITE/VIRT 1Q 2021 earnings call in May 2021:

Per below:

"Yes, Dan, obviously you look at the same metrics I do, just to give you a little commentary on them, I mean April volumes were a hair under 10 billion shares per day which is down 32 odd percent from the first quarter..."

Meaning: 1Q 2021 equity market making volumes at NITE were roughly 13 billion shares per day.

Let's compare the last KCG stand alone quarter: 1Q2017 (below) where total equity market making share volumes were "a hair OVER 10 billion shares per day": 10.082 billion shares per day to be exact.

KCG 1Q2017: 154 mil trading revenue

93.589 mil commissions/fees

eps .05/ 67 mil shares outstanding

Since Dougie "Mr Transparency" Cifu won't actually disclose 1Q2021 metrics, let's do some simple math and solve for "X" shall we?

NITE/VIRT COMBINED 1Q2021

Remember: "April volumes were down approximately 32% from 1Q 2021 volumes"

April volumes were a "Hair under 10 billion shares per day"

Therefore: Cifu says to Sell Side analysts on May 4 2021 earnings call: 1Q2021 share volumes were roughly 13 billion shares per day

The 1q2021 NITE/VIRT combined SEC reviewed 10Q

Document (sec.gov)

trading income: 812.743 mil

net commissions: 191.64 mil

eps 1.91/sh on 123.4 mil shares out

Again: 1Q 2017 OTCM Pink money laundering shell volumes: 90%+ of total equity MM volumes

OVERALL OTCM Volumes: 100-300 billion shares/month

in 1Q2021 OVERALL OTCM Money laundering share volumes were 4+ TRILLION shares

a 10-30x+ INCREASE 2021 vs 2017 in OTCM Money laundering shell volumes

YET TOTAL equity market making share volumes were up just 30+% 1Q2021 vs KCG stand alone 1Q2017???

How much market share did NITE/VIRT LOSE since 2017: 90+%???

NITE/VIRT 1Q2021 share volumes were MULTIPLES of 13 billion shares/day. Cifu is KNOWINGLY LYING

Further:

Recall: ANOTHER example of SEC corruption: the KCG 1Q2014 "astronomical" OTCM share volume metrics expunged by McKessy, Norberg, Pasquinelli, et al from the 1Q2014 10Q:

The KCG stand alone 1Q2014 10Q: the basis of my March 2014 letter to McKessy with Berger Montague : I have attached the KCG 1Q2015 SEC reviewed 10Q above

Year over year numbers: The corrupt SEC failed to expunge

pg 53

1Q2014 KCG STAND ALONE OTCM share volumes

14.045 BILLION shares/day (My Letter to McKessy)

EFTA00010839

EFTA00010840

NYSE/NASDAQ volumes: 862 MILLION shares/day

So according to Dougie "Mr Transparency" Cifu"

1Q2021 average daily share volumes were roughly 13 billion shares per day: This number is LESS than KCG stand alone 1Q2014 share volumes of almost 15 billion shares/day: 7 FUCKING YEARS AGO

In 1Q2014 KCG trading revenue was 254.6 million and eps was .30/share

This is blatant, egregious Cifu/SEC facilitated fraud on the public the SEC is mandated to protect.

WHY is Cifu hiding this from the investing public and as important: WHY is the grossly corrupt SEC letting him? Read my TCR. In furtherance of the conspiracy: the CORE business at Knight/KCG/VIRT: NITE is and always has been Illegal naked shorting OTCM shells to facilitate money laundering.

Further: Clayton et all CORRUPTLY gave NITE and CDEL their own exchange: MEMX: in 2020 for this EXACT reason

The FINRA OTCM share volume discrepancies explained: NITE/VIRT is NOT reporting the vast amount of illegal naked shorting OTCM share volumes. Recall my correspondence to the grossly corrupt SEC when MEMX was announced: "Just between us criminals"

Once again, my allegations are irrefutably accurate. The SEC has AGAIN doubled down and taken the side of the criminal entity NITE. As a result: the SEC ACTIVELY facilitates multiple, ongoing frauds on the public to the benefit of the criminals who own them while screwing the whistleblower who caught them: ME.

Cheers!

SDNY/NY Supreme Court/NJ judges: My apologies. I think I typed too fast for many on this email. Let me state plainly what I allege: For that, I turn directly to UBS Sell Side Analyst Alex Kramm who had quite the exchange with Cifu on the 1Q 2021 earnings call earlier this month.

Mr Kramm: based on my analysis below, tell everyone WHY you think Cifu chose to be "Less transparent" with regards to 1Q 2021 share volumes?

I'll type slower this time:

1Q 2021 OTCM total reported share volumes: 4+ TRILLION

Cifu on the call(I have electronic version should you prefer)

"Yes Dan (Jefferies analyst Fannon), obviously, you look at the same metrics I do, just to give you a little commentary on them (without actually disclosing them), I mean April volumes were a hair under 10 billion shares per day..."

Mr Kramm: this is a knowingly, blatantly false and misleading statement. Accurately: a bald face lie. This is why Cifu won't disclose the actual share volumes.

Per below: in 1Q 2017: the last stand alone KCG quarter: OTCM share volumes were reported in SEC reviewed 10Q at 9+ billion shares/day. Back when OTCM TOTAL SHARE VOLUMES were reported in the 100-300 billion shares per month.

Yet, in 1Q 2021 when total reported OTCM share volumes were more than 1 TRILLION shares per month, hitting almost 2 TRILLION shares in Feb 2021, Cifu would have us believe NITE Equity market making share volumes were a "hair under 10 billion shares per day".

A blatant LIE. The SEC knows EXACTLY what the NITE equity share volumes were in 1Q2021. And it was a LOT MORE than "a hair under 10 billion shares/day". Driven of course by OTCM Money laundering shells. Trading profits: illegal naked shorting. Exploding balance sheet. Insolvent still/again.

Once again, the SEC facilitating/covering up a MASSIVE ongoing fraud on the public to the benefit of the criminals who own them while screwing the whistleblower who caught them: ME

SEC IG Hoecker: HOW IS THIS REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE??

There is only 1 explanation: SEC criminal obstruction and corruption.

Like the Dick Best/FINRA BBH complaint: also my information. No mention of executing broker dealers/MM's. OR as the SEC would like us to believe: "Penny stock trading fairies" NO!

The SEC in ALL of these actions is protecting the criminal enterprise which has been bailed out on multiple occasions: Knight/KCG/VIRT:NITE

Automatically placing this criminal enterprise on the SEC "Do not investigate list".

As a result, the SEC has KNOWINGLY, ACTIVELY facilitated countless, ongoing frauds on the public it is mandated to protect. ALL of the illegal activity I have detailed is ongoing in May 2021. NITE is again/still insolvent. Cifu in the latest attempt to conceal this massive illegal activity has once again limited transparency for the investing public. The NITE Q1 earnings call: May 4, 2021

Cifu: "April volumes were a hair under 10 billion shares per day..."

So, the last 10Q filed by KCG/Knight as a stand alone company was 1Q 2017. The VIRT acquisition closed on July 31, 2017. Cifu won't disclose and the SEC let him KCG 2Q2017 financials. BLATANT fraud. Cifu/ the SEC wrote down more than $4 billion in fails.

Market Making stats. Cifu no longer discloses in SEC reviewed filings

Avg daily OTC BB and OTC Market shares traded (millions) 9,096

Avg daily NYSE AND NASDAQ shares traded (millions) 986

Per my consistent correspondence with the SEC: Knight/KCG:NITE derived $80 - 90\%+$ of their equity Market making share volumes from OTCM. This is why VIRT acquired KCG/Knight. This is and always has been the core business at NITE. This is what Cifu conceals from the investing public. In May 2021.

EFTA00010844

As I have also detailed over the last several years: FINRA share stats data is complete fraud. This ALSO continues in May 2021

Market Statistics - Equity Trading Data Monthly (finra.org)

At the top of the page: "Last month statistics: April-2021 Share volume 44+BILLION shares"

Yet below that under April share volumes: TOTAL SHARES: 928+BILLION

The Knight/KCG/VIRT: NITE balance sheet in 1Q 2021 filed with the SEC in May 2021

The balance sheet is AGAIN exploding

Inline XBRL Viewer (sec.gov)

NOT HFT related where holding time is seconds

Tangible book after properly classifying naked short fails: booked as an asset: receivable due to self clearing: insolvent. By a VERY wide margin.

ALL as a direct result of ONGOING SEC criminal obstruction and corruption.

So, Ms Pasquinelli: who was the executing BD/MM converting all of these fraud notes into worthless certs and dumped on the investing public where they are converted to real money? WHY would ANY BD/MM execute these trades? HOW do OTCM money laundering shells trade to trip zeroes? More buyers than sellers? NOPE: ilegal naked shorting to facilitate money laundering. That is why none of these actions have been posted to the OWB website. Even though they CLEARLY are eligible actions: My information.

Cheers!

Give me a call Mr Gottschall. After I help you find Castle Rock on a map, I'll walk you through it. I'll type/talk slowly for you. Because, if you can't find Castle Rock on a map you don't have a chance in hell of finding

Per below:

Judge Cote's sentencing of Dan Kamensky is a gross miscarriage of justice. The SDNY, NY Supreme Court, Audrey Strauss, Mr Kamensky's counsel, FBI, other DoJ attorneys are in possession of information which clearly indicates a long standing and grossly corrupt relationship between the SEC and Handler/Jefferies. Further, as is material in the "ongoing" Joshua Sason investigations of massive fraud committed on the SDNY/NY Supreme Courts and directly related to my multiple claims: AQR and Sason: MI Acquisition with known felon Tom Priore: ICP: also SDNY and now a direct lending client of Ares Management: Ressler: Drexel with Handler: also Neiman Marcus. In short: Handler/Ressler set up Mr Kamensky for fucking with their deal. Had Kamensky won his bid, Ares/Ressler would have been left with a much less valuable asset. AND put them further under water.

www.pecloserlook.org

The SDNY Courts had this information. Kamensky's counsel had this information. Judge Cote should have declared a mistrial rather than sentence Kamensky. A gross miscarriage of justice.

Now, let's turn to another example where the grossly corrupt SEC is ACTIVELY facilitating multiple frauds on the investing public while screwing the whistleblower who caught them: ME.

Recall ANOTHER completely fraudulent denial of award : UBS AML. Where Norberg/OWB invoked the ILLEGALLY enacted Summary Disposition Rule aka Christopher J Dilorio rule. Where the SEC own SEC website clearly states: ALL tips received are THOROUGHLY reviewed by Enforcement Staff. Meaning: The Summary Disposition Rule: SEC Staff never saw the information: is a KNOWN fraud.

Follow up for Mr Searles/Banerjee et al: SEC LA where multiple frauds left up and running. Ares also LA and NY. Milken: Beverly Hills

Recall: UBS San Diego: K2. Where FINRA,FINCEN, and the SEC all confirmed UBS cross border business was never shut down per the terms of the DoJ dropping it's DPA in 2010. Further, clearly obstructed by SEC IG Hoecker when I filed a complaint with his office in 2015 after receiving another denial for Award related to the UBS Reg Sho complaint. ALSO according to the SEC OWB FAQ: Enforcement staff notifies investigating staff of related tips received AND Whistleblowers are ALSO entitled to awards based on new lines of inquiry. The Mckessy/Norberg/Hoecker criminal obstruction led to the UBS cross border business never being shut down. The UBS AML complaint acknowledges this irrefutable fact.

UBS K2: NO individuals were censured/fined by SEC/FINRA. ALL correspondence to UBS Weehawken. SEC LA: Searles/Banerjee et al had ZERO jurisdiction.

Searles: Anton Chia and related fraud and money laundering. As I have also irrefutably proven: MULTIPLE frauds Up and running today.

It is no coincidence the SEC LA/ UBS San Diego multiple money laundering frauds. Searles et al are PROTECTING UBS San Diego. That's why none of these frauds have been shut down. The UBS cross border business is very much up and running TODAY

SDNY/NY Supreme Court Judges et al:

The interconnectedness of my claims on display AGAIN

Per my 2013 TCR criminally obstructed by McKessy/Norberg et al: WHY do $50 billion Swiss banks trade OTCM Pink penny and fractional penny stocks? The record is irrefutable: FINRA/SEC/FINCEN using my information: these publicly traded shells are the perfect money laundering vehicle. Absolutely IRREFUTABLE. WHY do firms like NITE and CDEL trade the same OTCM Pink shells? Abusive, illegal naked shorting to facilitate this illegal activity. Virtually riskless. VERY profitable. NONE of this happens without a willing executing criminal BD like NITE converting worthless certs to real money and dumped on the investing public the SEC is MANDATED to protect. ACTIVELY facilitated and perpetuated by the grossly corrupt SEC: reverse splits, no CAT, Obligation Warehouse: circumvent close outs of Rule 204, rarely revoked registrations, outsourcing the entire OTCM to the BD SRO FINRA, etc etc etc. I made the link between the money laundering and the illegal, abusive naked shorting. This is and always has been the core business at Knight/KCG/VIRT:NITE. ALL money laundering can be reverse engineered from the executing BD/MM level. The cash register.

What we are seeing in GME is a rounding error compared to the fails and illegal naked shorting in the OTCM.

EFTA00010867

As I have also repeatedly said: the only difference between a money laundering OTCM Pink shell and a NASDAQ SPAC is the amount of money being laundered. Also on display real time as I have detailed. As with Swiss banks and penny/fractional penny stocks: WHY do giant Quant Hedge Funds like AQR facilitate so many fraud blank check shell transactions? CERTAINLY does not fit the investment thesis of a firm run by PhD's.

WHY does giant PE/Real Estate firm Apollo play Fisker SPAC? WHY did Goldman, JPM, Jefferies et al bail out NITE more than once? WHY has the SEC repeatedly bailed out criminal NITE?

The most recent Earnings call for NITE was remarkable: SELL SIDE is actually doing what it's supposed to do and questioning NITE/Cifu lack of transparency particularly in the last few years. This has been going on for some time detailed by me and blessed by the SEC. This lack of transparency is designed to conceal from the public the true nature of the core NITE business: illegal, abusive naked shorting OTCM publicly traded shells to facilitate money laundering. Until now, the Sell Side turned a blind eye/ also intentionally misled the public by omitting these share volumes from their models. These share volumes have been the subject of other SEC/FINRA actions. But, somehow NITE has avoided such actions. INEXPLICABLE. The SEC/FINRA have done everything in their power to protect NITE. WHY? Because they bailed out a known criminal entity in 2012 and have been criminally and corruptly covering up this irrefutable fact ever since. As a result: The illegal activity has continued un abated. Then in 1Q2021, the activity hit a level not even dreamt of. It has been a well orchestrated and massive SEC facilitated fraud on the public the SEC is mandated to protect. A key player in this massive fraud is the corrupt SEC IG Carl Hoecker who not only has criminally and corruptly obstructed an investigation of my extremely serious allegations, Hoecker has also criminally obstructed Congress from executing its oversight of the SEC.

These corrupt, criminal, ongoing frauds have also found their way into the SDNY and NY Supreme Courts as I have detailed. Mr Kamensky is most definitely NOT on the SEC/DoJ "Do not investigate list". This can also be observed in real time. Per my correspondence: MI Acquisition: Magna/Sason: 40 Wall St with AQR/"payment processing" and felon Tommy Priore: ICP:SDNY.

There is a straight and direct line between ICP/Priore and the Degenerate Milken as well as the corrupt SEC/SDNY Kamensky "sting" that goes beyond the degenerate Milken flunkie Handler/Jefferies. Where Audrey Strauss Praised the work of the SEC. As I have previously detailed: Ares Management: Neiman Marcus: Tony Ressler: Milken/ Drexel degenerate flunkie has built quite the monstrosity. A little PE. A little Real estate. But the 800lb gorilla at Ares: Credit. Ressler's sister is married to Fat Leon Black. Close knit bunch for sure. Ares:

EDGAR Search Results (sec.gov)

Massive CLO manager/originator. 1 stop shop. Because as I detailed previously: now a direct lender to fraud money laundering entities like Priore/Sason/AQR et al: PRTH.

Because securitization drives the lending and is not a biproduct of sound credit analysis: Junk is junk REAL TIME.

I applaud Chair Waters and her efforts to reign in illegal trading practices detailed in my extensive record. However: non bank lenders like the massive Ares pose a systemic risk to the US financial system. CLO's are a massive fraud on the public developed by the Milken degenerates like the sub prime and S&amp;L's. The SEC actually brought a complaint recently: IIG which described using CLO's as a money laundering vehicle. The Caymans have recently cracked down also. Greensill: Credit Suisse: Milken: is another example of securitization as money laundering vehicle in sub prime factoring: Jim Justice. SBNY is also a securitization fraud: SBA.

Chair Waters and her Committees see the Credit Ratings Agency/SEC fraud I have also detailed.

My Coronavirus/repo virus: CLO correspondence: The SEC corruptly didn't downgrade massive CLO debt in 2020. The result: issuance exploded in 2021. Non bank lenders like Ares as well as Apollo, Jefferies, Ted Virtue etc etc have reaped tens of millions in management fees. Who told the SEC to obstruct the proper role of the

EFTA00010868

Credit Agencies to downgrade massive CLO's in 2020? Mr Clements knows. His garbage CLO "report" late in 2020 set the stage for the "all clear" to the SEC.

SDNY/NY Supreme Court Judges.

I once challenge the best and brightest the SEC/DoJ/FBI/IRS CI/FINCEN have to offer. Tear me to shreds. Make an example. I haven't been wrong about 1 single thing. NOT EVEN 1.

The record is simply irrefutable:

The latest edition of "The SEC is a grossly corrupt, criminal organization actively facilitating multiple, massive, ongoing frauds on the public it is mandated to protect to the benefit of the criminals who own them while screwing the whistleblower who caught them:ME"

I refer you to the SEC Office of the Whistleblower FAQ

Of course, I have multiple forms copied should you prefer

SEC.gov | Office of the Whistleblower

# SEC.gov | Office of the Whistleblower

3. What information can I submit to the SEC? The SEC conducts investigations into possible violations of the federal securities laws. In general, the more specific, credible, and timely a whistleblower tip, the more likely it is that the tip will be forwarded to investigative staff for further follow-up or investigation.

EFTA00010871

www.sec.gov

AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN IG Hoecker et al: the "summary disposition" aka Christopher J Dilorio rule corruptly enacted by Norberg/Clayton et al was/is COMPLETE FRAUD

per FAQ #12 from the grossly corrupt SEC/OWB website:

"ALL TIPS, complaints, and referrals received by the SEC are FULLY REVIEWED BY OUR ENFORCEMENT STAFF..."

FURTHER

"Complaints that relate to an EXISTING INVESTIGATION are FORWARDED TO the STAFF WORKING ON THE MATTER."

New line of inquiry.

I don't see how it could be ANY MORE CLEAR IG Hoecker et al.

In addition to annual reports to Congress ACKNOWLEDGING the OWB as the primary contact for whistleblowers to the Commission at large, this is damning. The summary disposition rule aka Christopher J Dilorio Rule: "SEC staff never saw Mr Dilorio's information" is complete and total FRAUD. Designed to use my information to both bring and obstruct thorough investigations while screwing me out of rightfull compensation.

IG Hoecker, I'm still looking forward to our first interview given the 3 (THREE) complaints I have filed with your office. The UBS Reg SHO Denial was complete fraud. The UBS FINRA/FINCEN, SEC AML Denial was complete fraud. The Opco Denial was complete fraud. ALL must be reversed. The Summary Disposition Rule/aka Christopher J Dilorio rule must be nullified RETROACTIVE to its passage as it is clearly contrary to the SEC Rules ITSELF.

Subject: Fw: Formal appeal for denial covered action 2015-016/ Knight Capital TCR &amp; Appendix

Judge Buchwald,

I hope your colleagues in the SDNY and NY Supreme Court have forwarded my information. Like your colleagues, you are the victim of another SEC fraud on the SDNY court. I am an irrefutable expert on SEC criminal obstruction and corruption. Jay Clayton was NEVER "shocked" by the widespread fraud in the OTCM and crypto markets.

Widespread Fraud in ICOs and Penny Stocks Shocked SEC's Jay Clayton - Bloomberg

# Widespread Fraud in ICOs and Penny Stocks Shocked SEC's Jay Clayton - Bloomberg

The former Wall Street deals lawyer who leads the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said one of the biggest surprises of his first year heading the agency has been learning about the levels ...

www.bloomberg.com

Clayton's firm Sullivan Cromwell/Jared Fishman/Rodgin Cohen et al are EXPERTS on penny stock fraud having bailed out the criminal enterprise Knight/KCG/VIRT:NITE on more than 1 occasion. OTCM shells and crypto are complimentary money laundering vehicles.

Clayton and the SEC have obstructed a thorough investigation of my very serious allegations for years. Including the 2017 merger of Virtu and KCG: NITE. As a direct result multiple, massive SEC facilitated frauds on the public the SEC is mandated to protect are very much ongoing. In 1Q 2021, more than 4 TRILION shares of OTCM money laundering shells were traded. Money laundering shells like SEC reporting HWIN and hundreds just like it. Bitcoin continues to be mined in China, Russia, and Belarus. Bitcoin claims to have a limited supply. But, can that actually be verified? On his way out the door, Clayton bought the Ripple action. As you have stated: extremely flawed SEC argument that Ripple IS a security but somehow Bitcoin ISN'T.

In fact: either ALL crypto are securities OR NONE are. The IRS for its part treats cryptos as a capital asset.

Subject to capital gains and losses for tax purposes. As your colleagues can attest, the interconnectedness of my information is irrefutable. Several entities including Signature Bank/Greenbox are just 1 example of my "Derivative" information.

Seems to me that Clayton, Hinman, crypto pumper Peirce ALL had KNOWN settled precedent to regulate Bitcoin and ALL crypto as securities: SEC V SG Ltd. Where appeals Court got it right and where Howey was applied:

Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42 | Casetext Search + Citator

Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42 | Casetext Search + Citator

EFTA00010873

Read Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. SG Ltd., 265 F.3d 42, see flags on bad law, and search Casetext's comprehensive legal database

casetext.com

The inconsistency in the SEC approach to regulating ALL crypto as securities has caused great confusion in the marketplace and has opened the door wide to fraud.

This is just another example of SEC corruption.

Now, the SEC corruption has reached your Courtroom as well

Cheers!

Welcome to Episode number: I lost track: of SEC criminal obstruction/corruption while screwing the public it is mandated to protect and screwing the whistleblower who caught them: ME.

Give me a call Mr Gensler. Love to catch up. Saw where you did a OTCM esque reverse split in the massive USO fraud on the public.

SDNY Judges et al, when you read about something as absurd and ridiculous as Hometown International with a Deli front and New Jersey and entities in Hong Kong and Macau, you're probably thinking what I was thinking 10 years ago when I began researching NITE and the OTCM shells they traded. But, these are NOT 1 offs. This is WHY the OTCM exists: abusive naked shorting OTCM shells to facilitate money laundering is and always has been the core business at NITE et al. This is WHY NITE has been bailed out multiple times by other criminal entities. There is no such thing as just 1 cock roach. HWIN is no different. It is part of a MUCH MUCH bigger and well orchestrated scheme.

More on Hometown International:

Hey look, there's a Senegal/Ivory Coast individual named Ibrahima Thiam with a Macau address

If the name Thiam is familiar, it should be: Tidjane Thiam the former CEO of Milken controlled Credit Suisse: Jim Justice: Greensill.

Judge Swain: still ANOTHER version of A Stroll Down the ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAS CHANGED Avenue. This is another version of my extensive correspondence as I wait on the SEC Final Determination. Below, I detailed the $765 million fraud DFC/taxpayer loan to almost insolvent Kodak to transition from film/cameras(buggy whips) to hydroxychlorquine. The DFC was run by Jared Kushner's college roommate. Massive fraud from the outset. The SEC of course never investigated the massive pump and dump related to this fraud. AND, thanks to the SEC egregious obstruction of Congress: there is STILL no CAT. Of Course the DFC first appointed IG Zakel (Sep 6 2020) concluded 2 months later that Jared's roommate didn't break any laws. Further: The Akin Gump internal investigation is ripped to shreds by yours truly below.

hey look! Marx, Karfunkel: BERK has the same auditor as Trump: Mazars. Prly just ANOTHER coincidence. For those of you incapable of following along: The probability that ALL of the Karfunkel illgotten gains in the SEC/Trump/Kushner/Blackstone/DFC et al facilitated P&amp;D/Insider trading went to Congregation Chemdas Yisroel is virtually ZERO.

Have I mentioned there was NO :zero,zilch,nada Jay Clayton et al/SEC/DoJ insider trading investigation into KODK?
OK, good. Got it covered

Maybe, just maybe had the grossly corrupt SEC thoroughly investigated my irrefutably accurate allegations: Blackstone/Schwarzman: NITE, the massive pump and dump fraud: Blackstone et al: KODK wouldn't have happened. Which is why there has NEVER been a thorough investigation of my irrefutably accurate allegations. In fact, the grossly corrupt SEC has criminally obstructed a thorough investigation of my claims SO THAT frauds like KODK can continue. The SEC is bought and paid for by criminals while actively facilitating MULTIPLE frauds on the public it is mandated to protect WHILE screwing the whistleblower who caught them: ME. the record Janey is IRREFUTABLE.

Finally Ms Wing/Strauss: will you be keeping your DoJ e mail address up and running months after you land a new gig like Geoffrey Berman has? Almost like he never left.

So Judge Swain: What has changed since your Sedona/Badian/Hirsch/Refco/Bawag decision?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

Yes: Blackstone/Schwarzman/Marx/Karfunkel/Kushner/Trump et al are most definitely on the SEC/DoJ "Do not investigate List"

www.sec.gov

New Rule 240.21F-18 Summary Disposition

(3) The information you submitted was never provided to or used by the staff handling the covered action or the underlying investigation (or examination), and the staff members otherwise had no contact with you.

AKA the Christopher J Dilorio Rule. Created to deny awards of rightful compensation. Per my appeal: a whistleblower CAN NOT know who at the SEC he/she should contact as investigations are done in strict confidentiality. Further, the OWB itself is the CENTRAL contact for whistleblowers. It is the EXPLCIT and EXCLUSIVE responsibility of the OWB to distribute whistleblower information within the SEC. This "rule" is FURTHER overwhelming evidence of SEC corruption and obstruction.

Judges Cave and Nathan: ALL information presented to your Courts must be treated with extreme skepticism if not outright disdain. IF the SEC is willing to commit massive fraud on whistleblowers who expose their corruption and criminal activity just imagine the evidence it is willing to fabricate to bring a case like they are in Kamensky. An immediate STAY in Kamensky is warranted until an independent thorough investigation of my claims can be executed. ALL evidence presented to your courts by the SEC must be questioned in light of the overwhelming evidence I have provided. Again: this corruption goes straight to Jay Clayton himself. His former colleague Jared Fishman has played a key role in this massive fraud. Clayton NEVER disclosed these conflicts. In addition, your Honors are in possession of other Clayton/Sull Crom/AQR/Girsky facilitated fraud: Nikola. This is what it has come to when you blow the whistle on the grossly corrupt SEC: They create a completely arbitrary and fraudulent rule to silence you.

Judges Cave and Nathan,

My allegations are chock full of members of the SEC "Do Not investigate Club". Per my TCR: Key to the Aug 2012 "glitch/Bailout: Blackstone/Schwarzman. Blackstone had done extensive Due Diligence on Knight prior to the "glitch" and had considered buying them north of $14/sh. Somehow/some way Blackstone decided not to go ahead with buying Knight not too long before the "glitch" which took the stock to $3. The ultimate bailout deal was NOT collateral based. Rather a convert with a %50 discount to $3: $1.50/share. "WHEW". Per my TCR: ALL 2012 "glitch" bailout participants including Blackstone knew EXACTLY the fraud on the Knight balance sheet. Because of SEC corruption/criminal obstruction, NITE is insolvent TODAY. Absolutely nothing has changed. A massive ongoing fraud on the public.

As a direct result of the SEC "Do not investigate Club", The KODK/Blackstone fraud on US Taxpayers (see below) was perpetrated on the public.

Steve Schwarzman/Blackstone are near the top of the SEC "Do not investigate List".

Obviously, Mr Kamensky is not in the Club.

As you can clearly see from my appeal to the OWB: The SEC intended to run out the clock. 5 years in the waiting in their Preliminary Determination Opco Award Denial for " Investigators never saw my information". Yet, SEC actions based on my information include: Hanover/Magna, JMJ/Keener, Fife, Southridge/Hicks, Opco, and UBSS. Missing somehow: NITE, Handler/Jefferies, Blackstone/Schwarzman etc etc.

The last overt act of this massive conspiracy has not yet occurred.

Mr Kamensky and I are BOTH victims of a longstanding and corrupt relationship between the SEC and Handler/Jefferies et al. Also victim of this corruption: the investing public the SEC is mandated to protect and the US Taxpayer.

"On June 15 2020, Kodak signed a Letter of Intent with Phlow in furtherance of its application to the DFC to show it had a CUSTOMER for its future API's"

So, where is the SEC reviewed/required 8k for this agreement?

https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=31235

Meaning: the DFC application was a FRAUD. Fraud on the government. Fraud on American taxpayers.

Further: WHY would the DFC consider "loaning" $765 million to KODK with NO EXISTING API capability when it already granted LESS money to Phlow/Ampac with proven capabilities? Answer: KODK liquidity issues are SEVERE

Like Milken: Insider trading is NOT the real issue here. The latest BX orchestrated "glitch": KODK.

Mr Best,

Congratulations on your new position as Director of SECNY.

No doubt you have earned the promotion. For those of you who don't know Dick Best from his FINRA days, this masterpiece is what got him his job at the SEC Atlanta office

https://www.finra.org/media-center/news-releases/2014/finra-fines-brown-brothers-harriman-record-8-million-substantial-anti

The BBH AML complaint. Truly, fantastic work.

ALL of the entities in the complaint are un named. WHY?

This is my information.

Swiss Banks, FFI's, and of course: penny stock trading fairies aka executing BD's/MM's that made it all possible. Per Dick's complaint: BBH delivered 80%+ of the trades to executing BD's/MM's. Did Dick Best criminally obstruct an investigation into my claims? Per my extensive correspondence with Robin Traxler at FINRA AND the fact that the SEC had my Knight Capital TCR in its possession for almost a year when Dick brought his BBH complaint. So, did Dick's complaint implicate entities in my TCR and that's why ALL of the entities in Dick's complaint are un named? Most certainly YES.

Recall, this scheme generated $850 MILLION in proceeds. Dick's $8 mil fine was not a deterrent. Intentionally so.

So Congrats Dick on your new position as Director at SECNY. Janey, Hoecker, Dick, the record is extensive of my correspondence including Dick Best at the Atlanta Office. No doubt he will be recusing himself related to matters involving the un named entities in his FINRA BBH complaint. OR will he do what is expected at the SEC: Criminally obstruct investigations while screwing whistleblowers like me?

Janey, Hoecker, Mehraban, Jay et al,

The massive SEC facilitated fraud on the public known as Knight/KCG/VIRT: NITE is reaching epic proportions in August 2020. For the new "accounting" hires at the SEC:

In 1Q2020, the receivable at NITE was up 90% or $1.2 BILLION from Dec 2019 to $2.562,721 billion

Per the extensive record Janey: fails: because of self clearing are booked as a receivable. FRAUD. no intention of delivering. More accurately a liability. AND per my 2013 TCR: a large portion: structural liability as a result of an open naked short fail position WHEN not if a reverse split is approved by the grossly corrupt SEC/FINRA. There are some new "buckets" Malusso,loffe, Dougie large have created within the Receivable as well. Creative. The accounting shell game: moving fraud (abusive naked shorts) from bucket to bucket.

The 1Q2020 10Q

Buckets total $2.441,283 BILLION

The FRAUD (please see the record Janey).

ALL of the receivable items are related to SETTLEMENT.

Certain items within the receivable: buckets: would zero out within days IF VIRT was in compliance with the Securities LAWS: Close out requirements of Rule 204. So, isn't it beyond amazing THAT: although there was

some change in certain buckets AND that the amounts were zeroed out within days of March 31, 2020 ONLY to end the quarter June 30, 2020 a mere $121.438 MILLION difference from the March 31, 2020 ending balance?????

That is absolutely f'n amazing: $2.562,721 BILLION zeroed out from March 30, 2020 THEN a $2.441.283 balance at June 30,2020. Well, the SEC does believe in "penny stock trading fairies" too.

Nope. Not penny stock trading fairies. AND VIRT didn't zero out :FAILED to SETTLE BILLIONS $$ in transactions. This massive fraud is due to NEVER closing/covering as is mandated by LAW. SEC, ongoing, massive fraud on the public. Classic bucket shell game. A la FCM and Reverse mortgages.

NOTHING has changed thanks to SEC corruption and obstruction while screwing whistleblowers like me. The massive NITE accounting fraud facilitated by the SEC that facilitates the ongoing fraud on the public the SEC is mandated to protect.

CLEARLY, IRREFUTABLY: NITE is and always has been a criminal entity. ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTING drives trading profits at NITE. ALWAYS has. Janey, please post Jay Clayton AND Ms Mehraban NITE conflict disclosures. No doubt, Dougie large will see this e mail the same way the grossly corrupt SEC has disclosed my information to NITE for the last 10 years. NITE is GROSSLY insolvent TODAY August 18,2020.

# SEC.gov | SEC Charges Interactive Brokers With Repeatedly Failing to File Suspicious Activity Reports

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Interactive Brokers LLC will pay an $11.5 million penalty to settle charges it repeatedly failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for U.S. microcap securities trades it executed on behalf of its customers.

www.sec.gov

SECNY: Lara Shalov Mehraban. Ms Mehraban, I've asked this before: Was Dougie "Large" Cifu your boss at Paul Weiss? The IBKR "complaint" is getting very close to your former boss/colleague isn't it?

Questions Ms Mehraban doesn't want the public to see:

Her former boss/colleague Dougie "Large" Cifu hired Alex Ioffe as VIRT CFO in 2019. From 2003-2019 Ioffe was CFO at IBKR. INCLUDING the period covered in Ms Mehraban's complaint.

Not filing SAR's, Microcap securities, AML red flags. No kidding. WHY are the securities un named? WHO was ultimate executing BD/MM?

As self clearing Ms Mehraban, isn't Knight/KCG/VIRT (Cifu): NITE the LARGEST clearing agent of microcap securities? How many SAR's coming out of your former boss executing BD/MM?

Per my TCR: NONE. ZILCH. NADA. How do I know that?

When would the criminal enterprise NITE which is run by Ms Mehraban's former Paul Weiss boss/colleague Cifu file a SAR:

BEFORE

or

AFTER trading billions of shares?

Did NITE Compliance rely on IBKR/Ioffe compliance? That would be a violation wouldn't it?

Ms Mehraban is the poster child of SEC corruption and criminal obstruction while screwing whistleblowers like me. Virtually real time in August 2020. Very much an ONGOING and massive fraud on the investing public.

Ms Mehraban, please pass along my warmest regards to your former Paul Weiss boss/colleague Dougie "Large".

No doubt you "chat" often.

The record is overwhelming AND irrefutable.

The SEC facilitated fraud on the public continues unabated. MORE irrefutable evidence of SEC criminal obstruction while screwing whistleblowers like me.

A direct result of this ongoing massive fraud on the public.

After NITE reported its 1Q2020 results I again again, again, like the last 10 years, alerted the grossly corrupt SEC to the massive accounting fraud at NITE as a direct result of abusive naked shorting.

Per my 2013 TCR Janey, Hoecker, Jay et al:

NITE is in a constant state of insolvency as a result of illegal, criminal, abusive naked shorting OTCM money laundering shells. This illegal activity drives trading revenue at NITE. This illegal activity is and ALWAYS has been the core business at NITE. This very profitable albeit illegal activity is WHY Sull Crom client KCG was bought by Virtu. This illegal activity is WHY NITE has been repeatedly bailed out by GS,BX,JEF, JPM and the SEC

The receivable is where NITE books naked short fails as a result of self clearing. NITE has no intention of closing/ can't close these naked short positions. NOT a legit asset. Further, the receivable isn't a legit asset NITE can convert to cash for its own use. There are prior commitments on these "assets": SETTLEMENT In 1Q2020, the NITE receivable grew to $2.5 BILLION. UP 90% from December 2019

These are NOT "assets". More accurately, these are LIABILITIES. Massive accounting fraud. After moving these fraud "assets" to the appropriate liability classification, NITE tangible book value is GROSSLY insolvent. The SEC has obstructed my allegations for several years while allowing NITE to write down this structural liability on

more than 1 occasion. Further, sell side analysts at the guidance of Cifu et al never question these EGREGIOUS balance sheet issues. AND, with the grossly corrupt SEC blessing, Cifu et al never disclose insolvency in any SEC filing OR investor presentation.

Per my 2013 TCR attached Janey, we know that Schwarzman/Blackstone has played a key role in perpetuating the criminal entity Knight, KCG, VIRT: NITE the Sull Crom client.

We also know Trump and Schwarzy are BFF's. Schwarzy is also connected to Kushner and Epstein.

Schwarzy is most definitely on the SEC's "Do not investigate List"

A stroll down the record Janey: Around the same time as the SEC/BX/JEF/GS et al August 1 2012 NITE "trading glitch", Schwarzy/BX were key advisers to bondholders of Eastman Kodak and to the company also. Jason New: Blackstone was re elected to the KODK BoD in May 2020.

Then the Pumper/Grifter in Chief Trump goes out wide and far with this absolutely incredible news:

The camera/film company Eastman Kodak is now going to be the US savior in pharma ingredients supply chain. This is a page out of the penny stock grifter playbook. This is what happens when we have a WH full of money laundering shell grifters. So, what has been the result of this incredible pump/transformation? KODK has gone from 2 to 90 back to 40.

As is typical Trump/grifters/ and his criminal Clayton led SEC: the public hasn't seen a 8K filed by KODK to detail this incredible "transformation". The SEC has given its blessing to yet ANOTHER Trump/Grifter/Bag Men P&amp;D. in KODK, FBO Trump BFF and Sull Crom client: Knight "savior" Schwarzy/BX. Had the grossly corrupt SEC investigated my claims instead of obstructing them and screwing me, MAYBE Schwarzy/BX would have thought twice about their latest grift: KODK. We know that Schwarzy is also a prolific GOP donor.

The grossly corrupt SEC response to whistleblower OVERWHELMING evidence of money laundering, manipulation, and fraud: MY INFORMATION has been remarkably consistent over the last 9 years++:

Obstruct, cover up, facilitate illegal activity at the expense of the investing public it is sworn to protect while screwing whistleblowers like me.

BLNK: A KNOWN Jaclin money laundering shell. Rev merger with a KNOWN Bag Man: Michael Farkas who was the largest shareholder of ANOTHER money laundering shell: SkyWay but somehow escaped the SEC investigation. With Board members like Engel: Drexel, Scigliano: Acies: NETE a CFO:New from NETE. A known to the SEC Bag Man: Keener who the SEC has kept up and running for YEARS since being BARRED (Not Exactly) by Industry SRO FINRA.

In addition to that name Farkas: ANDREW/Jonathan Farkas. Trump fundraiser and Epstein: Jeffrey: business partner, this fraud has an added element. So, after receiving my overwhelming evidence with AML red flags too numerous to count, what was the par for the course SEC response: Approved BLNK public offering just several days ago AND with my overwhelming evidence in hand. But, that's not where the corrupt SEC active facilitation of this massive fraud on the public ends. Yesterday, 7/22, BLNK put out a PR linking it to a few hundred charging stations in VA, MD, DC. This pr drove the stock up almost 30% at 1 point and closed 15% higher on almost 8x avg volume. A most certainly "MATERIAL" event. AND an event that required an SEC 8k filing if "DEFINITIVE" as well. No such 8K was filed by BLNK for this pr. This pr therefore must be complete FRAUD intended ONLY to facilitate a massive Pump and Dump on the public. It accomplished its intended fraudulent outcome.

But, back to BLNK fka New Image Concepts: the company

Between Blink and New Image Concepts, BLNK was known as Car Charging Inc

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1429764/000114420414059745/v390669_def14c.htm

This 2014 SEC approved offering also had several red flags of its own. WHOPPERS in fact.

Guess who ELSE was involved in this years in the operating money laundering shell?

Platinum Funds/Nordlicht. With links to Kushner(s) and Trump lawyer Giuliani. Other NY entities, a Columbus OH entity, a Chicago entity, and a Belize entity. Still counting the AML red flags?

The icing on the top of this massive SEC facilitated fraud: ex NM Governor Bill Richardson.

Who, is also linked to Jeff Epstein and his NM Zorro Ranch.

BLNK: money laundering fraud on the public ACTIVELY facilitated by the SEC in July 2020 despite overwhelming whistleblower (me) information. Linked to Milken,Russia, Trump, and Epstein. Of course the 7/22 trading activity NEVER would have happened without willing, executing BD's and MM's like the criminal entity known as Knight,KCG,VIRT: NITE. Which has also been kept up and running by the grossly corrupt SEC despite overwhelming evidence of a massive, ongoing, criminal conspiracy detailed by a whistleblower: me.

Janey,

MORE EXTRAORDINARY SEC corruption and criminal obstruction designed to protect criminals and screw whistleblowers like me. Despite my very generous 4 day offer to produce the entire record which is the basis of my award application/denial/appeal AND REQUIRED by the statute I have referenced:

240.21F-12 "Materials that may form the basis of an award determination and that may comprise the record on appeal", The several hundred e mails I have sent you, Hoecker et al MUST be part of this record. Janey, you failed to produce this record. As I made clear: my 6/23/2020 emails to you Hoecker, SEC commissioners were merely re re sent previously sent e mails: the record. Further, my 6/23/2020 e mail: Formal appeal for preliminary denial covered action 2015-016 Knight Capital &amp; Appendix was merely a summary of several hundred e mails sent to you, Hoecker et al. These e mails SHOULD be the record. You failed to produce the record. Which begs the question: WHAT "record" was used to determine the SEC preliminary denial exactly IF the SEC can't produce the record? The preliminary denial was completely fabricated and must be reversed. But, it doesn't end there: per my 6/23/2020 summary based on several hundred e mails sent to the SEC, the RECORD of EXTRAORDINARY corrupt obstruction designed to protect criminals and screw whistleblowers is not confined to Opco,NITE,UBSS,Sason,Keener etc etc etc. I have filed 2 TCR's with the OWB related to the money laundering/transaction

laundering/Putin/Rakishev/Trump/Kushner/Alfa/Crede/Peizer/Milken/Hapoalim/SBNY/CardWorks/ESQ/WireCard/AQR etc etc etc fraud known as Net Element. For YEARS the SEC has been in possession of not just my TCR's but HUNDREDS of e mails supporting my TCR's comprising the extensive record. Here again, the SEC is covering up a MASSIVE fraud perpetrated on the public and well within even the grossly corrupt SEC ability to shut down the fraud IF they had used my information to execute its mandate to do so. Instead, the SEC obstructed a thorough investigation. Per my previous e mails: the record: NETE claimed to be a payment processing entity. Claiming further to process BILLIONS of dollars worth of transactions every year. Its subsidiary Pay Online is linked to the massive fraud Wire Card. How's the SEC Wire Card investigation coming along? For years, based on my extensive financials research and other research, I pleaded and pleaded with the SEC to shut down this massive fraud. They did not. email after email. Year after year I wrote the SEC "NETE is a money laundering/transaction laundering fraud". Rather than shut it down, the SEC with the help of NASDAQ allowed fraud public offerings by Crede/Peizer/Milken related entities: Esousa and Cobblestone and a reverse split so NETE could keep its NASDAQ listing. The balance sheet has been grossly insolvent for years: goodwill.

ALL of my allegations were confirmed when NETE decided to "unlock value in its payment processing" business by doing a reverse merger with a CA EV "manufacturer" started by a musician. This fraud transaction is quite common in money laundering shell land dominated by NITE/VIRT. The SEC cover up of criminal activity while screwing whistleblowers:ME: The "payment processing business" is to be "sold". Related of course was the SEC cover up of criminal activity while screwing whistleblowers: ME: The Goldman/Sull Cromm advised purchase by ALLY of CardWorks: Merrick Bank: NETE and then the recent unwinding of this fraud transaction. No doubt the brain child of Chair Clayton and his Sull Cromm colleague Jared Fishman who has played a key role in keeping the criminal entity NITE/VIRT up and running.

NETE/Mullen: "here glitchy glitchy" cover up. But, who the hell would EVER touch the massive fraud: NETE? Only another fraud: Mullen.

Mullen doesn't "manufacture" ANYTHING. Mullen is simply a car dealership.

EFTA00010913

The K50 EV is manufactured in China by Qiantu a subsidiary of CH-Auto. Qiantu/CH have a production facility in China. There will be no Mullen "production" of EV vehicles in Washington or anywhere else in the US.

But, the SEC facilitated fraud doesn't end at protecting criminals and screwing whistleblowers: ME. Per my TCR attached, there is a well orchestrated eco system of fraud. Including "issuer/bag man funded research" that facilitates P&amp;D. In fact, on 11/8/2018 the SEC brought a complaint against an entity I cited in 1 of my emails to the SEC: the record: known as SeeThroughEquity

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-259.pdf

Janey,

the purpose of your 5 years in the waiting PRELIMINARY denial of my OpCo Award application could not be any more clear: run the clock out and protect NITE,UBSS, Magna et al while denying me rightful compensation. But, As I have repeatedly told you, Hoecker, your colleagues: the last overt act of this vast conspiracy has not yet occurred:

NITE/VIRT is insolvent today 6/30/2020 as a direct result of the SEC facilitated fraud on the public which is and always has been the core business at NITE/VIRT: Abusive naked shorting publicly traded shells to facilitate money laundering. The public is STILL at risk. The SEC has facilitated NITE intentionally misleading the public as to the true nature of its business. The SEC still facilitates this massive fraud on the public while it intentionally misleads the public there is no naked shorting because the SEC authorized the DTCC to create the illegal, shadow clear mechanism Obligation Warehouse (OW) so NITE's criminal activity can continue and it can circumvent close out REQUIREMENTS of Rule 204 of Reg SHO. ALL very much ongoing in June 2020 as a direct result of the SEC (OWB/Hoecker/Enforcement etc etc) criminal obstruction and ACTIVE facilitation of the criminal enterprise known as Knight/KCG/VIRT: NITE.

Clayton never disclosed his Sull Crom/Fishman/NITE conflicts. He must step down from the SEC IMMEDIATELY until a criminal investigation can be concluded. NITE must be halted IMMEDIATELY as it still poses a monumental risk to the investing public. FINRA should go back to being a cheerleader as it is just another enabler of this criminal activity. It has NO business enforcing SECURITIES LAWS. It should not be overseeing the OTCM. FINRA fines are a joke and not meant to be a deterrent. INTENTIONALLY siding with criminals over the investing public the SEC is mandated to protect. The cesspool known as the OTCM MUST be shut down. It exists

EFTA00010915</chris_diiorio@msn.com>

SOLEY for the purpose of facilitating a massive fraud on the public. The OW must be shut down IMMEDIATELY so the public can see just how pervasive naked short selling: MANIPULATION really is. EVERYONE at the SEC who has had contact with my information MUST resign/be terminated IMMEDIATELY. ALL of the AQR blank check shells must be shut down IMMEDIATELY as they pose a serious national security risk. AQR MUST be shut down IMMEDIATELY.

Certainly not exhaustive BUT a good start

But Keener not the only 1 involved who knew New Concept was a money laundering shell. CEO of Blink is Michael Farkas. SEC knows him well from his Skyway Communications days. The SEC revoked the registration of Farkas/Skyway in 2007 https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar? action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001128723&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40&amp;hidefilings=0

The CFO of Blink is Jonathan New. Formerly CFO of the AQR/Crede: Milken money laundering/Transaction laundering blank check shell: Cazador/Arco: Net Element

A director of Blink is a guy named Donald Engel who worked at Drexel with Milken. New Concepts was HQ'd in Santa Monica: Milken But it gets better the Jaclin shell factory also linked to Honig,Stetson,Alpha Cap, Frost as well http://www.teribuhl.com/2019/08/06/honigs-shell-factory-attorney-gregg-jaclin-barred-as-sec-lawyer/

Subject: Fw: Formal appeal for preliminary denial covered action 2015-016/ Knight Capital TCR &amp; Appendix

Ms Norberg,

I am in receipt of the SEC OWB correspondence allowing me more time to respond to the preliminary denial of my award application for the Oppenheimer 2015 covered action. This e-mail was the last 1 I sent to your office related to my appeal. It will serve as the basis of my appeal. Including the attachments of my 2013 TCR submitted with Berger Montague to the SEC. I will also forward correspondence from 2012 and following detailing my extensive correspondence with Robin Traxler at FINRA as well as Sean McKessy in the OWB. Even though, I have previously forwarded your office as well as the SEC IG office the exact same corroborating evidence. My response to you will be lengthy and detailed. However, given that it took your office FIVE YEARS to send me a preliminary denial notice, that is understandable and in fact a result of YOUR lengthy delay in notifying me. ALL of my response pertains to the denial appeal at hand.

In 2011, I filed my first Whistleblower complaint with the SEC. Detailing a massive fraud on the public directly implicating dozens of entities. The center of my claims: Knight/KCG/VIRT: collectively NITE and the Swiss banking giant UBS:UBSS. By far, NITE was and still is today the largest MM/executing BD in the OTCM space. I was shocked to find the Swiss banking Giant UBSS was trading many of the same stocks as NITE and to the extent they were. This came on the heels of the FINRA UBSS Reg SHO complaint where the extent of the UBSS activity "threatened to undermine the integrity of our markets" while the SEC analysis of this activity was simply a case of "sloppy record keeping". My experience as an Institutional Sales trader: executing multi million share equity trades for the largest institutions in the world like Fidelity and Putnam. In addition, as a Research Sales person: analyzing financial statements and making investment recommendations formed the basis of my expertise. In fact, the SEC OWB has paid out awards for information just like mine. In August of 2011, I informed the SEC that NITE was insolvent having reported just $105 mil in working capital at June 30, 2011. AND, for the reasons cited in my TCR detailing massive accounting fraud as a direct result of illegal naked shorting/self clearing/reverse splits/cusip changes etc. The SEC had a choice: investigate these extremely serious allegations and shut down this massive fraud on the public OR cover up their failure and allow this massive fraud on the public to continue. Unfortunately for the American public the SEC is mandated to protect, the SEC chose the latter. As a direct result, ALL of the activity detailed by me in this TCR and other TCR's filed with the SEC as well as 9 years of additional correspondence with the SEC, this is very much an ongoing, massive scheme. One that the SEC actively facilitates. Countless losses have been incurred as a result. NITE as I detailed is in a constant state of insolvency. The SEC has time and again intentionally misled the investing public that there is no abusive naked shorting. NITE is still in business TODAY.

The core business at NITE is and always has been: abusive naked shorting OTCM shells to facilitate money laundering. Not DMM, FCM, reverse mortgages, or even HFT. This illegal business is EXTREMELY profitable and

EFTA00010920

virtually riskless. AND, both the SEC and FINRA know this. In 2016, FINRA brought a Rule 204 complaint against NITE. The fine was pathetic and not meant to be a deterrent. This is WHY the OTCM exists. But it's not JUST OTCM as my AQR TCR filed with the SEC clearly proves: NASDAQ Blank check shells as well. I have also filed separate TCR's related to NewLead and FreeSeas: 2 massive money laundering shells which began on NASDAQ, de listed to the OTCM. NONE of the activity detailed in the Opco/Gibraltar complaint takes place without a willing executing BD/MM who ultimately turns worthless certs into real money. That #1 trader is NITE. As you read in my Knight TCR CGFIA is at the heart and, because it was based in Colorado, became a template of sorts for my extensive research. See Ms Norberg, unlike the SEC "investigators" on the Opco/Gibraltar complaint, I've actually seen first hand the CGFIA "world HQ" as well as the rented Littleton home of CGFIA CEO Guyer. I've done extensive research on Properties claimed to be owned and M&amp;A transactions done for the sole purpose of cert printing and distribution (Aurelio AMNP) where the ultimate acquisition amounted to a distributor of Ukrainian folk music. I've also done extensive research on domestic and foreign financial institutions claiming to "invest" in these scam companies like Josh Sason/Hanover/Magna also cited in my 2013 Berger/Knight TCR linked. So, as I detailed to Ms Traxler, I followed Guyer to Neuchatel Switzerland and his previous endeavor: Antelope Technologies also with an office in Highlands Ranch CO. Where I discovered a connection to Swiss/German individuals/entities that were also related to another OTCM shell in the OpCo/Gibraltar complaint as well as my Knight TCR: AppTech. Offices in the Woodlands TX and Boca Raton. AND very much up and running today. SHOCKING. The SEC OpCo/Gibraltar complaint is based on the FINRA complaint. That is absolutely irrefutable. As the Gibraltar complaint alleges just 1 OTCM shell and just a million shares while Commissioners Stein and Aguilar referenced BILLIONS of shares in their OpCo waiver dissent. Who executed those BILLIONS of shares? Was OpCo even a MM? If I ask a question it's typically a rhetorical: I know the answer. The SEC knows the answer also. The SEC OpCo complaint does not mention the executing BD/MM. The SEC complaint doesn't mention Sason/Hanover/Magna either. The SEC complaint makes no mention of illegal naked shorting which is clearly evident in the CGFIA 10Q referenced below. THIS IS MY INFORMATION. So, why aren't NITE, Hanover/Magna and UBSS implicated in the SEC OpCo/Gibraltar complaint? What my TCR clearly and irrefutably proves: NITE was engaged in illegal activity both BEFORE and AFTER the SEC et al orchestrated August 1 2012 "trading glitch". So, the SEC bailed out a KNOWN criminal entity. Unfortunately for the investing public, the SEC has doubled downed on facilitating this illegal activity into 2020. The "glitch". Knight was insolvent in August 2011. I told the SEC this. The "glitch" proved my allegations. Key point in my TCR: NITE inadvertently sent 4000 worthless securities to JPM to secure an emergency bridge financing as collateral. These were open, naked short fails that could not be covered/closed due to a cusip change (SEC/FINRA approved rev split) booked as an "asset"(receivable) due to self clearing: MASSIVE accounting fraud. Ironically, the "glitch" proved my allegations: despite claiming to have a "highly liquid balance sheet" NITE had to raise the entire amount of the "glitch". AND the ultimate "financing" was not collateral based. Rather a 50% discounted convert when the stock had already been crushed to $3 OR $1.50. ALL of the financing participants knew the NITE balance sheet was complete fraud. NITE also committed securities fraud in pledging those 4000 worthless securities as collateral to JPM: SCOTUS Rubin: pledging collateral to secure financing is an offer to sell. JPM looked the other way. As did the SEC.

Further, I submitted my amended TCR with Berger in March 2013, In August of 2013, FINRA brought a penny stock AML complaint against OpCo. Sale of unregistered penny stocks. WHO ultimately executed the trades? 2008-2010. In July 2013, the "glitch" financing Gen Atlantic/Getco reverse merger with Knight to form KCG closed. The new CEO of KCG was Dan Coleman who ran Equities at UBSS during their Reg Sho and cross border activity. For UBSS, the DOJ (Acosta Downing et al) dropped their DPA in 2010. My claims: the FINRA OpCo/Gibraltar complaint clearly implicates UBSS criminal activity AFTER the DoJ dropped its UBSS x border DPA. This is what the SEC is protecting in the OpCo/Gibraltar complaint: NITE/UBSS/Hanover/Magna illegal activity.

Also in my Knight/Berger 2013 TCR: IMDS. A multi year money laundering shell kept up and running by the SEC. Also NITE, UBSS, and Hanover Magna. In addition to other entities like JMJ, Southridge, and Alpha Capital Anstalt. Alpha Capital Anstalt is very much in business today as a result of SEC obstruction while the SEC

EFTA00010921

recently brought a complaint against JMJ for activity like that in IMDS even AFTER he was barred by FINRA. In IMDS, the SEC allowed 2 barred individuals (CEO/CFO) to do an offering that created 37 BILLION shares of IMDS at .0001 with Chinese Nationals before revoking the IMDS registration. What do you do with 37 billion shares of IMDS at .0001 when there are no bids below that? NOTHING. The stock never traded. The SEC orchestrated a NITE/UBSS/Hanover/Magna/JMJ/Alpha etc MASSIVE naked shorting to facilitate money laundering scheme bailout so that the MASSIVE naked short position didn't need to be covered in the open market as is mandated by Rule 204. Thus insuring profits and not MASSIVE losses for NITE and UBSS.

I also filed separate TCR's for NewLead and FreeSeas. 2 "Greek shipping" money laundering shells started on NASDAQ and delisted to OTCM. NITE top trader in BOTH. Hanover/Magna in both. I contacted the KY Div of Mines and notified the SEC that these "transactions" were complete fraud. The SEC Feb 2019 complaint against Hanover/Magna is my information: Bogus obligations, assigned, converted to worthless certs. Then dumped on the public and converted to REAL money by the executing BD/MM:NITE. Who generates illegal trading profits by abusive naked shorting. Very symbiotic relationship. 1 of the Hanover/Magna entities was Gibraltar/Hanover. Somehow omitted from the SEC OpCo/Gibraltar complaint. In NewLead, then SEC White and Ceresney firm Debevoise did a "fairness opinion" of a Russian Nickel wire transaction where the NewLead CEO had back dated documents. That has been expunged from SEC reviewed filings. FreeSeas: a structured tax evasion/money laundering shell. Also involved Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Both Debevoise clients. Both involved in the tens of billions Russian Mirror trade scheme. In addition to Hanover/Magna a Milken related entity Crede: Run by Milken/Drexel/Obstruction of justice/Parking: Terren Peizer and his felon partner Michael Wachs. This led me to Net Element NETE. Peizer again. This time with more AML red flags than be counted. Well known to the SEC through TWO of my separate TCR's. CEO is Oleg Firer. Firer former money laundering shell Acies shut down by the SEC while NETE was left up and running. Acies very much up and running also in MA. In NETE: NASDAQ. AQR Blank check shell. SEC allowed 2 offerings so that NETE could keep its NASDAQ listing. 1 was with entity Esousa: felon Wachs ex wife. 2nd was with Cobblestone: felon Wachs sister. I told the SEC. They still approved the offerings. I discovered AQR money laundering blank check shell activity doing research on NITE and Hanover/Magna. A top traded NITE OTCM shell was Cereplast. Another AQR blank check shell.

Hanover/Magna/NITE/ and Alpha Capital Anstalt. Alpha is Liechtenstein based and controlled by Martin Schlaff: Austria/Israel. Also IMDS (w/Schlaff controlled Balmore) and the Frost/Honing/Stetson et al complaint. Schlaff also LH Financial/Wolfson/Sulphco and Bawag: Sedona/Scan Graphics: Refco: Naked shorting. NITE is Refco on steroids. Cereplast ended in bankruptcy.

NETE claims to be a "payment processor". BILLIONS in transactions processed. Never break even let alone profitable. Balance sheet complete fraud. AML red Flags: Firer is Grenada Amb to Russia living in Miami, Apockinas/Grinshpun/Antonov/Rakishev/Trump/Kushner/SBNY/CardWorks/Merrick Bank/ESQ/Cohen etc etc etc money laundering/transaction laundering BILLIONS shell. Kept up and running for years since filing my NETE/AQR SEC TCR's. ALL of my allegations proved accurate in 2020 when NETE received Cares Act taxpayer money then announcing it was "unlocking the value in its misunderstood payment processing business" by doing a reverse merger with a CA electric car company started by a former musician. The payment processing business to be "sold" and the new company (Mullen) will own 80-90%. All made possible by SEC obstruction and ACTIVELY facilitating illegal activity. Another AQR blank check shell is Astra/Phunware. More Greek shippers related to massive swindler Economou originally intended to do an "energy logistics company" acquisition and somehow settled on "mobile app developer" Austin TX: Phunware. PHUN CEO is well known to the SEC with shells going back 15 years. I alerted the DoJ and SEC that PHUN was a money laundering shell. In addition to the "genius quant" AQR, AIPAC: Gerber/Hudson Bay, Nordlicht: Ari Glass/Boothbay, 1MDB: Khazanah Nasional, Global Crown/Rani Jarkas/EFG/BSI/Optima/Max Fang. AG Barr 1MDB waivers: Kirkland also AQR. Broidy: Trump: 1MDB money laundering. PHUN also received Cares Act money. AND PHUN is Trump/Kushner/Parscale campaign mobile App. PHUN should have also been shut down long ago. AQR too. OTHER AQR blank check shells: CIS/Delta/Urban Tea, Ability/Cambridge, Hunter Maritime, and MI Acquisition/Priority Tech Holdings. Ability/Cambridge: Israeli cellular intercept/surveillance. Israel sent employees to jail. In the US it was "securities fraud". The SEC Ability/Cambridge complaint was handled by Ansu Banerjee in the SECLA office.

EFTA00010922

Milken/Mogilevich/BoNY money laundering entity Sinex: Debasish Banerjee. WHY did SECLA have jurisdiction over ABILF/Cambridge? Result: ABILF is very much up and running today. I believe this is the PHUN/Trump/Kushner/Parscale mobile app technology.

Hunter Maritime: HUNTF: Never consummated an acquisition. Just cert printing/dumping. Also involved: Milken family office: Silver Rock. MI/Priority: PRTH. CEO Tom Priore: well known fraudster to the SEC. Also transaction/money laundering like NETE. Also involved: Hanover/Magna.

ALL AQR money laundering shells up and running today thanks to the SEC. Only recently did the SEC revoke CGFIA and NewLead. well after going dark and the massive fraud on the public had already been perpetrated. In NewLead, FreeSeas, etc etc etc a common tool used is reverse splits to perpetuate and facilitate illegal activity. SEC/FINRA approved. The result is the massive accounting fraud at NITE. WHEN not IF there is an open naked short fail when a rev split takes place, a new CUSIP/security is issued. Trades in the old cusip/security cease. This creates a structural liability. The fail/short can NOT be closed. Like covering a short in AAPL with MSFT. Because NITE is self clearing it books a prop naked short as a receivable. An asset. But, because NITE won't or CAN'T deliver, massive accounting fraud. Literally a liability booked as an asset. This is how "glitches" are born. But the SEC facilitated fraud doesn't end there. The definition of a failed trade: 1 that hasn't settled. The SEC/DTCC issue new securities where trades in the old haven't settled yet AND not authorized by the issuer. Settlement: buyer brings cash/seller brings securities. The DTCC simply makes journal entries. But there are still "IOU's" in the system. The SEC authorized the DTCC to create a shadow clear, non guaranteed, ILLEGAL (clearly contrary to 34' Act "prompt and accurate settlement) Obligation Warehouse so criminals like NITE et al can circumvent close out REQUIREMENTS of Rule 204. The OW is just what it sounds like. Per my Knight TCR, DTCC suspends services (Chill/Lock) and trades are deemed "ex clearing". In a FOIA request made with POGO, Berger and I asked the SEC fails data on dozens of NITE/UBSS top traded stocks like CGFIA, APCX and IMDS. The SEC response: see our website. The SEC fails data is for DTCC cleared trades only. The SEC knows exactly the level of fails sitting in the OW. They don't disclose. Intentionally misleading the public there is no naked shorting. In 1Q2020, the receivable at NITE/VIRT increased $1.2 BILLION sequentially. Up almost 90%. AND the tangible book value is grossly insolvent. When it comes down to it, there really isn't ANYTHING in the receivable that NITE can convert into cash for its own use. There are prior commitments on those "assets": SETTLEMENT of transactions. Because the SEC has never shut down this activity, NITE is in a constant state of insolvency. Other examples of SEC attempts to cover up NITE illegal activity so that it can continue include:

Cerberus/Feinberg/VIRT bidding on NITE post "glitch". Wasn't their turn. First, Gen Atlantic needed to monetize its GETCO "investment". The HFT business at GETCO was in a death spiral when the rev merger took place. So what was the attraction to NITE? The business that had absolutely ZERO overlap/synergies: OTCM. As low tech as it gets. Literally a trader sitting in a chair. As I have asked the SEC on hundreds of occasions over the years: what would happen to NITE trading profits if their OTCM share volumes went to ZERO? Cerberus is Feinberg: Gruntal/Milken. Also bailed out Bawag: Refco, HSH, and Deutsche Bank ($50 bil Bad Bank to Goldman). Another Milken/NITE connection is Rich Handler: Jefferies. Also a Milken/Drexel protege. Milken was Gruntal: Feinberg, SAC, Icahn, Sater etc. Gruntal was "sold" to Ladenburg. Controlled by

Vector/NewValley: Icahn/Lorber/Elliman etc. And, was sold to multi billionaire Frost. Who, according to the SEC risked it all trying to "make" a few million when he, Honig, Stetson, Alpha et al were really LAUNDERING. Milken also Whiterock, D H Blair (Morty Davis) and AR Baron (Bressman/D H Blair) which was the precursor to Bear Stearns collapse. So, Milken and his merry crew of flunkies are really at the nexus of JUNK. They own Trump and his White House (Trump casino junk) and they own the SEC. It was Milken, Leon Black, Handler, Moelis, Virtue: Drexel that caused the S&amp;L taxpayer bailout stuffing them with junk like Trump's. It is no coincidence that these same flunkies are also the largest CLO originators/managers. CLO's: Junk on steroids. AGAIN Bailed out by taxpayers in Cares Act HY. There also connections to Epstein. Treasury Sec Mnuchin and Black: HY/Junk/S&amp;L's and Epstein. Black: Money laundering shell ESWW kept up and running by the SEC was/is an Epstein money laundering vehicle: JUNK IS JUNK.

THIS EXPLAINS the Handler/Jefferies/Milken repeated bailouts of NITE. It also explains the SEC criminal obstruction.

EFTA00010923

SEC Chair Clayton is also directly linked to this criminal obstruction. His firm Sullivan Cromwell and Jared Fishman are ACTIVELY facilitating this massive fraud on the public. Clayton did not disclose these conflicts in his disclosures. Sull Crom/Fishman have advised Knight/KCG/VIRT and several transactions designed to facilitate this ongoing and ongoing fraud on the public. Many of the same players involved in the "glitch" were involved in the VIRT acquisition of KCG in July 2017. In addition to Sull Crom/Fishman and Handler/Jefferies: JPM and Goldman. The SEC facilitated fraud in the NITE/VIRT transaction is egregious illegal activity. The transaction NEVER should have happened. KCG was an SEC reporting company until the deal closed on July 31 2017. Despite this FACT, VIRT CEO Cifo refused to "publish" KCG 2Q2017 financials. I estimate Cifu/Coleman/Handler/GS/JPM wrote down more than $4 billion in open naked short fails: "leverage". The SEC let him. Meaning: "assets" used to determine the take out/ tangible book of KCG was complete fraud. VIRT grossly OVER paid for insolvent KCG.

Prior to the NITE/VIRT transaction closing in July 2017, NITE would report its trading stats monthly. Including OTCM share volumes. Cifu stopped this post merger. The SEC let him. In fact, you will find NO reference to NITE/VIRT OTCM share volumes in any SEC reviewed filing, sell side research or investor presentation. A well orchestrated fraud on the public. Omissions to Intentionally mislead the public as to the true representation of the NITE/VIRT business model. These share volumes are also at the center of my 2013 Berger TCR. There are no affirmative disclosures in any SEC filings to this day as to the AML risks posed in trading these OTCM and other shells. In a 2014 letter to the SEC, I detailed the first 2 months of NITE OTCM share volumes. When the 1Q2014 10Q was filed, these volumes were confirmed: An ASTRONOMICAL increase sequentially as well as year over year. These share volumes/my letter/TCR SHOULD have triggered an immediate SEC investigation. It did not. This portion of the KCG 1Q2014 10Q was expunged as well as 2Q2014 OTCM share volumes. I have detailed this to the SEC/OWB/Enforcement/IG. In the months leading up to the NITE/VIRT closing in July 2017, KCG put out monthly trade stat pr's showing KCG trading more volume than the overall market. Also indicative of naked shorting. Those pr's were also expunged. I also including electronic forms to the SEC OWB/Enforcement/IG. The SEC has essentially outsourced the ENTIRE OTCM market to the Broker Dealer SRO FINRA. Including: management of the OTCM share volume website fka OtcBB.com. Today, there is very little transparency into trading activity by MM as a result. Also: ISSUER corporate actions: rev splits, Short interest reporting: an absolute farce given there is still no CAT. AND BD compliance with the BSA. Per my TCR: WHY did NITE and UBSS trade Billions of shares of CGFIA and IMDS AFTER a Chill or Lock was placed (ex clear/OW)? CLEAR AML red flags. Because they had an open naked short position. Why not pull a market? Because they had an open naked short position. SAR's? WHEN? BEFORE OR AFTER THEY TRADED BILLIONS OF SHARES? There were no SAR's either. NITE can not outsource its compliance responsibilities to 3rd parties (like OpCo) when executing trades as MM. In 2015 at a SIFMA conference, Ceresney was "shocked" by the number of BD's under his supervision filing 1 or ZERO SAR's. NITE SHOULD have been investigated for egregious BSA violations long ago based on my TCR. Knight/KCG/VIRT:NITE is and always has been a criminal enterprise. Spitzer Russian/US mob bust: "worthless paper". Ashton Tech became VIE became Optimark became Knight/Trimark NITE literally "made by the mob". The SEC has known this for years. ALL of the "worthless paper" shells were SEC reporting companies. Today, Trump PA Campaign Mgr David Urban sits on the NITE BoD. AND is also on the BoD of his very own money laundering shell: Canadian/Pakastani/pot/COVID: FSD Parma: HUGE. Trump advisers/campaign staff Bannon and Parscale also involved in OTCM money laundering shells. Parscale Cloudcommerce fka Roaming Messenger also receiving taxpayer Cares Act money.

Madoff: more money laundering than Ponzi. HOW THE HELL did the SEC let that scam go on for as long as it did? Criminal obstruction. The former SEC IG Kotz actually investigated his "bosses" at the SEC unlike current IG Hoecker. Years of SEC obstruction. Bullshit "investigations" into "running ahead" meant to distract. Similar to the SEC "glitch" "market access complaint" where former SEC "glitch" Enforcement Dir Khuzami/Kirkland(Barr) also rep'd NITE. Can't make this up. The center of IG Kotz scathing failure of the SEC in Madoff: SEC NY and Mr John McCarthy who ended up being Knight/KCG Chief Counsel. As I said: can't make this up. And, as we know Madoff started his career in NASDAQ penny stocks exactly like the 1's in the Spitzer/Mob complaint.

EFTA00010924

OTCM: This is WHY the OTCM exists: abusive naked shorting publicly traded shells to facilitate money laundering. CEO Cromwell Coulson CHAIRED the FINRA market Regulation Cmte. Say it with me: Can't make this shit up: CMTSU. A founding OTCM Board member is former NITE trader Andrew Wimpfheimer:CMTSU. This is a very well orchestrated and ongoing fraud on the public. Russian mirror trades: no SEC OR DOJ investigation HOW? According to stories: activity peaked in 1H2014. Coinciding with NITE astronomical OTCM 1Q2014 share volume increase. In addition to money laundering penny stock shells, the OTCM is also home to many ADR's. Including Russian ADR's cited in the NYDFS/DBTCA/mirror trade complaint. Little/no disclosures. Also in my TCR: P&amp;D is just a tool used to facilitate the fraud and NOT a stand alone fraud. The SEC intentionally stops short of thorough investigations into much bigger frauds. The same way it has the public believe the "penny stock trading fairies" convert worthless certs to real money. NO! willing executing BD's and MM's like NITE do that. Less than a year after filing my Knight TCR with Berger, FINRA (not the SEC) brought the BBH AML complaint. This was my information. Swiss banks, foreign/domestic institutions, executing BD's/MM's/ penny stock shells: $850 mil in proceeds. Did BBH implicate NITE and other entities in my claims? WHY are all of the entities in the complaint UN NAMED? In the interest of transparency for the investing public? In 2019, I also filed an award application for the UBS x border/AML complaint. This is BLATANTLY my information. SEC/FINRA/ AND the SEC. I filed an IRS TCR based on my SEC TCR attached. In April 2016, 2 IRS CI Agents: VIKAS Arora and Nathan Sarnacki flew to Denver from Chicago to meet with me. I believe they were blown away. Then came the UBS complaint. As a follow up to our meeting, they wanted to know WHO at the SEC I shared my information with. I told them. That was the last I heard from them although I continued to send them my information.

To the SEC IG Carl Hoecker: In 2015 I parted ways with Berger as I was convinced the SEC was using my information in an unethical/illegal manner to both bring and obstruct complaints. Berger was not willing to file an IG complaint. After parting ways, I almost immediately did just that. Prior to retaining Berger I had filed an award application for the UBS Reg Sho complaint. In my submission and my correspondence with Mckessy/OWB I made the claim based on OWB permissible rules to "open a new line of inquiry". One that would link the trading activity detailed in my ultimate TCR by NITE and UBSS. That link: Abusive naked shorting publicly traded shells and money laundering. My application was denied and there was no investigation into this link. The SEC had just bailed out a "known criminal enterprise":NITE "glitch" was not a forthcoming admission. Neither was the blatantly and knowingly false pretext for the DOJ dropping its UBSS x border DPA because "UBSS was in full compliance" in 2010. So, rather than open a new line of inquiry, the SEC chose to obstruct.

I made clear to Hoecker the egregious conflicts by Khuzami, White and Ceresney with clients UBS, JPM, CS, and DB. Hoecker claims to have conducted a "thorough" investigation of my very serious allegations and found nothing. Despite MJW waivers received to "investigate" her Swiss bank client CS. Then in 2019, Hoecker arrogantly told me I could file a FOIA request on his findings. Then, came 2019 and absolutely nothing had changed. NITE was still trading billions of shares of OTCM shells like ELTZ. There were still no risk disclosures. Cifu refused to publish KCG 2Q2017 financials, Hanover/Magna/AQR/Alpha/IMDS etc etc etc were still up and running. I filed ANOTHER complaint with IG Hoecker. Despite the fact that Hoecker himself wroth the IG handbook on "thorough investigations" mandating complainant interviews, I have never been interviewed by Hoecker. In addition, the IG Hoecker is mandated to inform Congress as to serious allegations like mine. He did not. In doing so, obstructed Congress from executing its oversight of the SEC/OWB. And despite hundreds of offers to fly to SEC HQ to have the best and brightest at the SEC rip apart my allegations 1 by 1 I have never been taken up on my offer. Why is that? The SEC OWB has gone to great lengths in other cases to explain the OWB process etc to whistleblowers. I have never been told "no thanks" for my information. In fact, McKessy has solicited MORE information from me after submitting my Berger TCR. In Madoff, an intern could have verified/shut down in weeks NOT years. No contra parties. Only a well orchestrated obstruction by SECNY/McCarthy et al kept it up and running. As I have also repeatedly told the SEC: My claims could be verified in weeks also. NITE has a P&amp;L for every stock they trade. These, aggregated, are basis for quarterly trading profits. These P&amp;L's, combined with OW data, and balance sheet data will validate ALL of my claims. I've offered my service to do exactly that. 2 weeks max. Afterall, proprietary trading strategies are NOT proprietary if they're

EFTA00010925

illegal. For the reasons I have listed in this summary, NITE/VIRT is on the SEC "do not investigate list". And yes, there most definitely is such a thing. Especially when it comes to illegal activity facilitated by the SEC. So, the SEC denial of my OpCo award claim which was 5 years in the making is just another example of my very serious allegations: The SEC solicits and uses whistleblower information like mine to both bring and obstruct complaints. Unethical. Illegal. To deny my award application because the "investigators" didn't see my information is further affirmation of my allegations. They saw it. They used it. They denied my compensation for it. Again Ms Norberg, I will forward my 2012 etc emails with Robin Traxler at FINRA as well as McKessy as further evidence that my Award application denial should be overturned. Further affirmation from 2 dissenting SEC Commissioners and the judge in the Gibraltar case makes this denial both egregious and bizarre. Bizarre ONLY if you believe that there is no SEC obstruction that is. BTW, crazy stuff going on with the firing of Mr Berman/Clayton nomination to take his place/Rabbitt to DoJ/Carpenito replacing Audrey Strauss/Trump/Barr don't you think? The SEC needs some fixers. Wonder why.

I'm cc'ing some our mutual friends on this email Jane. The last overt act of this massive ongoing, SEC facilitated conspiracy has not occurred yet.

As straightforward as it gets:

The SEC OWB dragged its feet for 5 years in issuing its preliminary denial notice.

The SEC knows this is my information. The SEC committed fraud on the court in Gibraltar. The judge corrected them. The SEC was omitting information that implicated NITE, UBSS and customers like Sason/Hanover/Magna.

The SEC was obstructing a thorough investigation of my claims. The naked shorting cited in the CGFIA 10Q in 2013 PROVES my allegations. The SEC's "targeted investigation" stops short of a full accounting. The SEC

EFTA00010926</chris_diiorio@msn.com></chris_diiorio@msn.com>

Gibraltar complaint does NOT explain the totality of the Oppenheimer complaint. The SEC Gibraltar complaint cites 1 OTCM shell and less than 1 million shares traded by Opco. 2 dissenting Opco waiver SEC Commissioners proved that also citing "BILLIONS" of shares in their dissent. The SEC/Opco AML complaint was based on the FINRA complaint and my information. The SEC OWB concocted a completely fabricated reason for denying my Award: "The SEC investigators involved never saw claimants information". The responsibility to distribute Whistleblower information within the SEC is the exclusive and explicit responsibility of the OWB. As a result, the massive fraud taking place continued well into 2020. The 1Q2020 10Q proves this.

The SEC IG Hoecker is guilty of violating specific IG requirements in keeping Congress informed of serious matters like mine. The SEC IG Hoecker has never interviewed me despite my filing 2 separate complaints with his office. The SEC IG Hoecker is guilty of criminal obstruction. SEC Chair Clayton and Co Enforcement Peikin worked at Sullivan Cromwell with Jared Fishman. Fishman has played a key role in the SEC facilitated criminal obstruction. Peikin and Clayton should have recused themselves from ANY pending NITE/VIRT matter before the SEC: My information. Clayton and Peikin should have recused themselves from the SEC facilitated KCG/VIRT merger. My information, including the Opco AML complaint SHOULD have stopped the merger from ever happening. 2 former SEC Commissioners agree with that analysis. The SEC is actively facilitating a massive, ongoing fraud on the American people they are mandated to protect. NITE/VIRT is a criminal entity. The SEC MUST invoke emergency powers and halt trading in VIRT IMMEDIATELY.

In short Mr Arp, the criminal activity actively perpetrated by the SEC OWB/IG must be referred to law enforcement as well as Congress. Separate but related: SEC facilitated criminal activity and my claims. The criminality is a matter for law enforcement. My pending matters with the SEC have no bearing on a criminal investigation OR a GAO investigation.

You are incorrect in your analysis.

I Urge the IG Integrity Board to have SEC IG Hoecker refute my claims point by point.

I will be on a plane tomorrow so he can do it in person.

This is CLEAR,IREEFUTABLE,INCONTROVETIBLE evidence of naked shorting by executing BD's in CGFIA. This activity took place per my Knight/UBSS TCR submitted to the SEC. So, WHY did the SEC obstruct an investigation into the ENTIRETY of the trading activity in the FINRA (and FINCEN) complaints? WHO were the executing BD's/MM's? WHO were the customers?

The veracity of my information is also irrefutable and incontrovertible.

Game. Set. Match. The SEC is a grossly corrupt, criminal enterprise facilitating illegal activity detailed by me so that this activity can continue. It does in 2020. The SEC solicits then uses Whistleblower information (MINE) to bring complaints AND obstruct other illegal activity while denying proper compensation to whistleblowers (ME). The SEC KNEW who the "third party BD" was in the CGFIA filing long before it filed its Opco complaint in 2015. It had my TCR in its possession in March 2013. So why did it take 5 years for the SEC to issue its preliminary denial? I would remind the SEC that this is very much an ONGOING conspiracy on the part of the SEC et al.

More evidence of SEC fraud on the court in Gibraltar.

It is CLEAR that the Opco AML Covered Action 2015-016 was NOT ENTIRELY based on the SEC Gibraltar Action. The SEC Gibraltar action covered trading activity in just 1 OTCM Money laundering shell: Magnum d'Or where Opco traded less than 1 million shares. CLEARLY the SEC Opco complaint was based on the trading activity in the FINRA Opco AML complaint: my information. However, the SEC Opco complaint even stops short of a thorough investigation of the ENTIRETY of the FINRA trading activity. WHY? WHY didn't the SEC Opco/Gibraltar complaint go into trading activity in the FINRA AML OTCM shells through 2014 as FINCEN did? WHY did the SEC omit MATERIAL information to the court in Gibraltar causing a "significant under estimating" of criminal activity? The SEC knows who the accounts were. The SEC knows who the executing BD's/MM's were. The SEC committed a fraud on the court in Gibraltar.

Gibraltar was ROLLING OUT NEW OTCM services into the end of 2011.

In the summer of 2012, I had extensive correspondence with Robin Traxler at FINRA where I also cc'd Sean McKessy then SEC OWB Chief. The CURRENT OWB Chief and the SEC IG are in possession of this correspondence. My correspondence dealt with 2 penny stock shells cited in my Knight Capital TCR submitted by Berger Montague in March 2013 attached here: Colorado Goldfields and AppTech. Both shells were NITE and UBSS top traded OTCM shells in 2010-2013. These 2 shells were cited by FINRA in their Oppenheimer AML complaint. Again, the SEC and FINCEN Oppenheimer AML complaints were based on this FINRA complaint. In fact, per the FINRA Opco complaint above, customer "TC" was dumping worthless AppTech (APCX) certificates well into mid 2010. DIRECTLY overlapping with the NITE/UBSS APCX trading activity cited in my Berger 2013 TCR attached and discussed by me with Robin Traxler at FINRA. HOW is it possible that the SEC OWB didn't share my information with SEC investigators? Current SEC OWB Chief Norberg was previously an assistant to then OWB Chief McKessy.

WHO ultimately executed the trades cited in the FINRA Opco complaint?

Further, the SEC Gibraltar Securities complaint raises more questions than answers as well.

WHY didn't the SEC go after ALL of the sellers in the FINRA Opco AML complaint? WHY did the SEC "strip out" $46 million from the Gibraltar ill gotten gains claiming the customers were "UNKNOWN"? WHO is the SEC protecting? WHO were the executing BD's/MM's in the FINRA Opco CGFIA and APCX trades? They certainly know who the customers were. Is customer "JK" Justin Keener/JMJ also in my March 2013 TCR attached? While the SEC Opco AML was based on the FINRA Opco AML, it stopped short of a thorough investigation of NITE and UBSS. In fact, the trading activity of NITE/VIRT and UBSS in the FINRA complaint: my information SHOULD have triggered an immediate investigation of NITE and UBSS. It did not. Did the SEC commit fraud on the court in its OMISSION of material information?

The timing of the SEC's preliminary determination and the reasoning for the denial ALSO raises more questions than answers.

My Award application for the Oppenheimer AML SEC complaint was 5 years ago. That's FIVE years ago. So, WHY NOW am I so blessed by the SEC with a preliminary judgement?

The SEC basis for denying my Award claim for covered action 2015-016:

"Investigative staff responsible for the covered action NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM THE CLAIMANT OR had any communication with the claimant"

Let's take this whopper in 2 parts:

First, the SEC OWB denied my Award application because The investigators in the complaint never received my information. Has the SEC OWB re written the investigative protocol in this denial? How am I or ANY whistleblower supposed to know WHO the investigators are in a particular case WHEN according to the SEC: ALL investigations are done in a confidential manner???

WHAT DOES THE SEC DO WITH WHISTLEBLOWER TIPS EXACTLY? Do they share whistleblower information with ENFORCEMENT as is mandated? HOW would ANY whistleblower know WHO to share information with at the

EFTA00010934

SEC? Isn't that the job of the SEC OWB?

Second, the fact that no one at the SEC contacted me DOES NOT mean the SEC didn't use my information. This is a completely bogus argument. It certainly would NOT be the first time the SEC used my information now would it Jane?

In fact, it is NOT the responsibility of the whistleblower to get his/her information to the right Enforcement personnel. That responsibility EXPLICITLY falls on the SEC OWB. So, is the SEC OWB admitting gross negligence in handling my information? After the monumental failure in the Madoff Ponzi/ money laundering SEC facilitated scam on the public the then SEC IG made specific recommendations to the SEC with regards to the proper handling/vetting of Tips and Complaints.

AGAIN: The responsibility to properly vet Whistleblower information and get the information into the right hands at the SEC falls EXPLICITLY and EXCLUSIVELY with the SEC OWB itself and is NOT the responsibility of the whistleblower. Further, according to the previous SEC IG in the monumental Madoff failure: the responsibility to contact those supplying Tips and Complaints ALSO falls explicitly and exclusively with the SEC OWB and not the whistleblower. Using these excuses as the basis of denial of Award is completely contrary to SEC MANDATED protocols and procedures.

Is the SEC OWB admitting it doesn't comply with those recommendations? Recall: the monumental SEC Madoff failure was NOT the fault of Whistleblowers either. OR is the SEC OWB scrambling for a 5 years in the waiting preliminary determination?

So, after 5 years of waiting for a preliminary determination for my award claim, this is what the SEC best and brightest come up with?

My Denial of Award for covered action 2015-016 was completely made up on the fly.

The SEC OWB has applied completely fabricated "rules" to issue this denial. Further affirmation of ALL of my allegations.

Also by SEC admission, the SEC allowed these 2 penny stock shells to remain a clear and present risk to the investing public. Were CGFIA and APCX ONLY money laundering shells for Oppenheimer in 2008-2010 and then suddenly they were no longer money laundering shells when NITE and UBSS traded billions of shares of both shells 2010-2013?

WHY did it take until September 2018 before the SEC finally revoked the CGFIA registration?

https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Garpa&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany

So, WHY was there no SEC investigation of NITE and UBSS trading activity in money laundering shells APCX and CGFIA? The SEC et al facilitated NITE "glitch" took place in August 2012. This SEC/Jefferies/JPM/BX/GS/SEC Chair Clayton Sullivan Cromwell colleague Jared Fishman et al bailout coincides directly with NITE trading activity in 2 SEC/FINRA/FINCEN acknowledged money laundering shells. AND the "bailout" penny stock esque reverse merger between Getco and Knight didn't close until July 2013. HOW could the SEC conduct a COMPLETE and thorough investigation into the FINRA Opco AML complaint WITHOUT implicating NITE when NITE was CLEARLY trading billions of shares of OTCM money laundering shells BEFORE and coinciding with the SEC et al facilitated

EFTA00010935

"glitch" bailout? For UBSS, the DOJ dropped its cross border AML DPA complaint in 2010. UBSS was trading money laundering shells well after the DOJ claimed UBSS was in compliance with the cross border DPA. To be clear: BOTH NITE and UBSS knew CGFIA and APCX were money laundering shells when they traded billions of shares of each 2010-2013. Is that FACT disputed by the SEC? The SEC OBSTRUCTED a thorough investigation into the ENTIRETY of trading activity of NITE and UBSS in CGFIA and APCX: MY CLAIMS. Josh Sason/Hanover/Magna knew CGFIA was a money laundering shell also https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1344394/000114420413041432/0001144204-13-041432-index.htm ALSO in my claims: Joshua Sason/Hanover Magna. CGFIA. Also my NewLead TCR1426518350699 and FreeSeas TCR1440274395191 separate but related TCR's where NITE was a top trader in both and BOTH TCR's were filed well in advance (years prior) to the Sason/Hanover/Magna February 2019 complaint. Here's one thing the SEC has been consistent about: The SEC ignores the role of executing BD's and MM's in these scams. WHY? Because NITE is the #1 OTCM shell trader. As far as the SEC is concerned Penny stock trading fairies convert worthless certificates into real money. NO! Executing BD's/MM's like NITE do. Did Oppenheimer sell this order flow to NITE? Who ultimately converted these worthless certificates to real money? As the number 1 OTCM money laundering shell trader it is statistically improbable the NITE has never been the focus of an SEC AML complaint. Per my TCR: what does the NITE Compliance Department do exactly? How many SAR's has NITE filed in the last 10 years? In a 2015 SIFMA speech then SEC Enforcement Director Ceresney was "SHOCKED" by the number of BD's filing 1 or ZERO SAR's. That was just 5 years ago. WHEN would NITE file a SAR releted to the billions of shares of OTCM money laundering shells it trades like CGFIA and APCX: BEFORE or AFTER it trades those BILLIONS of shares? Does NITE pull markets and alert regulators OR continue to trade billions of shares of OTCM money laundering shells in the face of GLARING AML red flags? In fact, in December 2019 the top traded NITE/VIRT OTCM money laundering shell was ELTZ https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar? action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001607281&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40&amp;hidefilings=0

## SEC.gov | SEC Charges Broker-Dealer and Transfer Agent in Microcap Shell Factory Fraud

Doesn't the NITE/VIRT compliance Department have internet service in Jersey City? As a DIRECT result of the SEC obstructing a complete and thorough investigation into the ENTIRETY of trading activity in APCX and CGFIA, the top NITE/VIRT traded OTCM money laundering shell in December 2019 was AML red flags galore ELTZ. Illegal activity ACTIVELY facilitated by the SEC. The examples cited in this e mail are not exhaustive.

And, for it's part AppTech is up and running again/still
https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Apptech&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany

Unfortunately, AppTech is still up and running as a direct result of the aforementioned SEC "CLEARLY under estimating" otherwise known as CLEARLY OBSTRUCTING.

In conclusion, The SEC solicits information from whistleblowers like me. The SEC uses whistleblower information to bring actions and then doesn't compensate whistleblowers for their information.

OR

The SEC uses whistleblower information to protect criminality perpetrated on the investing public so that this criminal activity can continue. BOTH are gross dereliction of the stated and MANDATED SEC Whistleblower statutes. To blame a whistleblower for the SEC's EXPLICIT and EXCLUSIVE responsibility to properly vet and distribute whistleblower information within the SEC as an excuse to deny Awards is also criminal activity. The SEC: criminals using whistleblower information to protect other criminals AND deny whistleblower rightful compensation for their information.

I appeal the SEC preliminary determination and wish to file ANOTHER complaint with the SEC IG.

Cheers!

Janey,

how long have you been in possession of my Knight Capital TCR? Almost 7 years to the day. How many follow up e mails have I sent the SEC since then?

For 7 fucking years, the SEC has known about JMJ/Keener. I told them
https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-72.pdf

# IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION No. COMPLAINT SUMMARY - sec.gov

5. Justin W. Keener, age 45, resides in San Juan, Puerto Rico. During the Relevant Period, Keener was a resident of Miami Beach, Florida. Keener registered the name "JMJ Financial" as a fictitious name in Florida in 2008 and used it to conduct the business described

In February 2019, the SEC brought an action against Joshua Sason/NewLead I told the SEC about Magna/ Sason ALSO in my 2013 TCR. https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2019/lr24403.htm

# Joshua Sason, et al. (Release No. LR-24403; Feb. 15, 2019)

Washington, D.C., February 15, 2019 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against four individuals and related businesses for their roles in two microcap frauds and unlawful securities offerings.

www.sec.gov

AND, I filed separate but related NewLead and FreeSeas TCR's in 2015

Then there's the UBS AML complaint.

ALSO my claims. For which I sent 10 (TEN) separate Award applications from a commercial fax machine in April/May 2019. AND I have YET to receive even a preliminary determination from the OWB/Norberg IG, I see your "investigation" into my very very serious accusations of Obstruction related to my information was thorough. In short, the SEC has and still is ripping me off.

Janey, be a hun and update my TCR's/Awards cited in this e mail.

And Ms Welshhans, a couple of questions for you:

1) Have you read the FINRA WTFC Keener complaint? Fictitious notes Ring a bell?

Same MO as Sason/Magna/NewLead/FreeSeas etc etc etc

2) WHO executed the Keener OTCM trades in your complaint? Penny stock trading fairies?

YES, NITE was a top trader in BOTH FreeSeas and NewLead

The core business at NITE/VIRT is and ALWAYS has been: abusive naked shorting OTCM (and other) shells to facilitate money laundering.

In short Ms Welshhans, NITE/VIRT converts these worthless certs into real money. NONE of

JMJ/Sason/IBC/Ironridge/Asher etc etc etc activity takes place without a willing, corrupt, criminal, executing BD/MM like NITE/VIRT, CDEL etc

Finally, The Keener SEC complaint is FURTHER evidence that FINRA has NO business enforcing US securities LAWS. When FINRA "invited" Keener to a disciplinary hearing almost 7 years ago, Keener told them to "fuck off". FINRA bar meant nothing the last 7 years. EXCEPT JMJ/Keener/NITE ripping off more investors.

Obviously the SEC has/is using my information. I expect to be compensated.

Cheers!

Mr Peirce,

Congratulations on your nomination as SEC Commissioner. I have read your paper on FINRA lack of accountability. I believe the SEC has abdicated its responsibility to enforce Broker Dealer compliance with the BSA to FINRA BECAUSE it is not accountable. The SEC has not initiated a single stand alone AML complaint.

EFTA00010938

The Brown Brothers Harriman AML complaint IS my claim. ALL of the entities in the complaint are un named WHY? My SEC and IRS Whistleblower complaints explain why.

Hello, My name is Chris DiIorio. I have filed extensive SEC and IRS Whistleblower complaints alleging a direct link between penny stock money laundering, domestic and foreign entities, Swiss Banks, and executing brokers like KCG and UBS. I can provide overwhelming evidence of SEC obstruction. Please read the FINRA Brown Brothers Harriman AML complaint. This is my claim. All of the entities in the complaint are un named. Why? The SEC is not only obstructing an investigation, they are aiding and abetting the activity. These are not far flung theories. The UBS Whistleblower Birkenfeld and his attorney sent 52,000 accounts to the SEC and DOJ. The DOJ at the influence of President Obama and Hillary Clinton entered into the UBS DPA based on just 4400. What is so egregious is the activity continues un abated today.

Start with the so called August 2012 Knight/KCG trading "glitch". Initial reports say the NYSE was breaking the trades. WHY did they stop. Former KCG CEO Joyce said he had a very frank discussion with then SEC Chair Schapiro where the SEC wanted to send a very strong message to market participants. Why not just continue to break the trades and hit KCG with a hefty fine? That would not create the conditions to grant KCG exception after exception to do their emergency funding which transferred 74% of the company to "glitch" funding participants and ultimate reverse merger partner GETCO. AND, despite claiming to having a "highly liquid balance sheet" KCG had to raise the entire amount of the loss.

A very significant and public event was cited in a WSJ article where immediately following the "glitch" KCG inadvertently sent 4000 worthless securities to JPM in an attempt to secure a tri party financing where JPM guaranteed the loan. This is discussed in my attached TCR's and also the topic in a March 2014 letter I sent to the SEC. In the end, the emergency funding was NOT collateral based. The participants knew exactly what a fraud the KCG balance sheet was. After the stock was decimated to $3, the deal was a convertible with a conversion price at a 50% discount or $1.50/ share.

There is much more, but this is a good start.

Recently, KCG did a modified Dutch auction where they "sold" an asset (HotSpot) to an entity both KCG and GETCO were a major shareholder (BATS) KCG CEO Coleman called it a "highly competitive process".

Virtually all of the proceeds went to buy back stock from "glitch" financing participants. The purchase price was $14/share. The stock had never traded there and hasn't since. Reports say 82 million shares were tendered at or BELOW $14. But they chose to repurchase 23 million shares AT $14????? I have overwhelming evidence that supports my allegations that the SEC is engaging in criminal obstruction to protect KCG.

1) Current KCG Dan Coleman ran Equities at UBS during the massive REG Sho violations as well as the cross border activity detailed by Whistleblower Birkenfeld. White and Ceresney represented UBS prior to joining the SEC
2) At June 30 2011 KCG/Knight reported just 105 million in working capital with hundreds of millions in worthless securities sitting on its balance sheet. KCG was insolvent
3) The SEC orchestrated the emergency funding for KCG following the so called Aug 2012 trading "glitch"
4) Read FINRA AML complaints against Brown Brothers Harriman. This is my claim. It links penny stock money laundering to executing brokers like KCG, domestic and foreign entities, and Swiss banks. ALL of the entities in the complaint are un named. WHY?
5) The FINRA World Trade Financial AML complaint discusses several entities cited in my claims. The customer the complaint focuses on is Justin Keener. Still very much in business. The red flags cited by FINRA were cited in my claims as well. Yet still no investigation.
6) in July 2015 I contacted Kevin Goodman Dir OCIE for Broker Dealrsat the SEC. He had never seen my information. The IG OCIE Madoff report mandated the OCIE to vet information. McKessy and Ceresney never sent my info to him
7) I'm sure you are familiar with the Manning v Merrill, KCG, UBS et al litigation. The SEC does not want an investigation into my claims while the litigation is pending.
8) My claims detail ex clearing trading activity by KCG and UBS. despite the glaring red flags in doing so. Ex clearing s the Obligation Warehouse. A NON GUARANTEED SERVICE set up by the SEC and DTCC to allow firms like KCG to circumvent close out requirements of Rule 204. Clearly contrary to the intent of the SEC

EFTA00010939

authorization in Sec 17a of the 1934 Act to create a system of prompt and timely settlement and to remove impediments there of.

In short, I told the SEC KCG was insolvent in 2011. Rather than investigate and prosecute, they chose to obstruct. The activity in my TCR's pre dates the "glitch". An investigation would show the SEC bailed out a criminal enterprise. Because of the obstruction, the activity continues today unabated in stocks like STBV,VELA,NEWL,FREE, and dozens more. The investing public remains at risk

More to come
