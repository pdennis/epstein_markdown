Hi _______ – I did not hear from you last week, which probably means that you did not hear from DOJ. We have to get an answer today or I may not be able to indict Epstein before I leave on my 3-week vacation in May, and we cannot put this off that long.

On the issue of assigning another AUSA, I know that _______ talked with you about assigning someone from Miami, but _______ in Fort Pierce is my first choice. In Miami, my first choice is _______. I am just worried about the travel for _______.

Thank you!

I am off to Mag Court but should be back around noon.
