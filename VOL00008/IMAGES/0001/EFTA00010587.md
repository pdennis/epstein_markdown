Thanks! Could you please both fill out the attached form? There's a mask mandate in federal buildings regardless of vaccination status (our team is vaccinated), so we'll all be wearing masks tomorrow. I should mention that the water fountains at our office don't work (a contamination issue), so you may want to bring water bottles.

For places near the office, I like a small coffee shop called Blue Spoon (76 Chambers Street), which has breakfast.

Nothing in our investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.

Hi

No need to take any more time out of what I’m sure was a busy weekend for you. Let’s set a time for Tuesday morning (the earlier the better for me). Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

Southern District of New York

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented [redacted] prior to his passing in 2018. Agent [redacted] served [redacted] with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan’s former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

Joe
