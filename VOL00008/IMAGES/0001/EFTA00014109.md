Hi -- I think I have designed a solution to the 2255 issue and I will call you to discuss the plea. I am still finishing up these search warrants. As soon as they are done, I will give you a call.

Dear Roy and Jack:

I am just writing to re-state that it is the Government's position that we have a signed, binding agreement and that there is no need for further modification.

Please keep us informed of the date and time of the change of plea and sentencing.

Thank you.
