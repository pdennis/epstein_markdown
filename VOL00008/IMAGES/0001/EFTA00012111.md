Section 1.3 Filing of Financing Statements and Continuation Statements: Consent to Registration. Grantor hereby authorizes Secured Party to file UCC financing statements and amendments thereto, listing Grantor as debtor, and Secured Party and/or its assigns, as secured party, and describing the Collateral, and assignments thereof and amendments thereto.

EFTA00012152

a) Grantor, at its own cost and expense, will cause the Aircraft to be duly registered in the name of Grantor as owner and subject only to Secured Party's first priority security interest and International Interest, and at all times thereafter to remain duly registered, in the name of the Grantor as owner with the FAA pursuant to the Act.

b) Grantor will not use the Aircraft in violation of any law or any rule, regulation or order (including those concerning alcoholic beverages or prohibited substances) of any governmental authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration relating to any item of Equipment issued by any such authority, except to the extent such violation is not material or the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order is being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings (but only so long as such proceedings do not, in the Secured Party's opinion, involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of such item of Equipment, or any interest, including the Secured Party's security interest or International Interest, therein or related thereto).

c) Grantor will operate the Aircraft solely in the conduct of its business and/or for commercial purposes (and not for consumer, home or family purposes) and in such configuration as authorized by the FAA. Grantor will not operate the Aircraft or permit the Aircraft to be operated (i) at any time or in any geographic area when or where insurance required by this Agreement is not in effect, (ii) in a manner or for any time period such that a Person other than Grantor will be deemed to have "operational control" of the Aircraft except with the prior written consent of Secured Party, (iii) for the carriage of persons or property for hire except with the prior written consent of the Secured Party or (iv) transport of mail or contraband. Possession, use and maintenance of the Aircraft will be at the sole risk and expense of Grantor and the Aircraft will be based at the Primary Hangar Location. Grantor will deliver to Secured Party a written waiver of any Lien or claim of Lien against the Aircraft that is or could be held by any landlord (other than a governmental entity) or mortgagee of any hangar or storage facility where the Aircraft is or will be located. Grantor will not permit the Aircraft to be based away from its designated Primary Hangar Location for a period in excess of thirty (30) days without Secured Party's prior written consent. Grantor will cause the Aircraft to be operated at all times by duly qualified pilots who (x) are supplied by Grantor, (y) hold at least a valid commercial airman certificate and instrument rating and any other certificate, rating, type rating or endorsement appropriate to the Aircraft, purpose of flight, condition of flight or as otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Regulations or other applicable law or regulation, and (z) meet the requirements established and specified by the insurance policies required hereunder and by the FAA. GRANTOR WILL NOT OPERATE, USE OR LOCATE THE AIRCRAFT, OR PERMIT OR ALLOW THE AIRCRAFT TO BE OPERATED, USED OR LOCATED, OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, ALASKA OR CANADA WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE SECURED PARTY. Grantor will execute and deliver and file with the FAA on or prior to the date hereof an Irrevocable De-Registration and Export Request Authorization with respect to the Aircraft in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

Section 2.2 Records and Reports. The Grantor will cause all records, logs and other materials required by the FAA and any other governmental authority having jurisdiction to be maintained, in the English language, in respect of each item of Equipment. Grantor will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Secured Party such information as may be required to enable the Secured Party to file any reports required to be filed by the Secured Party with any governmental authority because of the Secured Party's interests in any item of Equipment.

Section 2.3 Maintenance. Grantor, at its own cost and expense, will fly, maintain, inspect, service, repair, overhaul and test the Aircraft (including each Engine of same), or will cause the Aircraft to be flown, maintained, inspected, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested, under an approved FAA maintenance program and in accordance with (a) all maintenance manuals initially furnished with the Aircraft, including any subsequent amendments or supplements to such manuals issued by the manufacturer from time to time, (b) all mandatory "Service Bulletins" issued, supplied, or available by or through the manufacturer and/or the manufacturer of any Engine or part with respect to the Aircraft having a compliance date during the term of the Note and up to twelve (12) months thereafter, and (c) all airworthiness directives issued by the FAA or similar regulatory agency having jurisdictional authority, and causing compliance with such directives or circulars to be completed through corrective modification or operating manual restrictions, having a compliance date during the term of the Note and twelve (12) months thereafter. Grantor will maintain the Aircraft in good and safe working order and in substantially the same condition as when originally delivered to Grantor, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Grantor will cause the Aircraft to be subject to an FAA Airworthiness Certificate at all times other than when the Aircraft as a whole is the subject of an Event of Loss. Grantor will maintain, or will cause to be maintained, in the English language, all records, logs and other materials required by the manufacturer thereof for enforcement of any warranties or by the FAA. All maintenance procedures required hereby will be undertaken and completed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures, and by properly trained, licensed and certified maintenance sources and maintenance personnel, so as to keep the Aircraft and each Engine in as good operating condition as when originally delivered to Grantor, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and so as to keep the

Page 3 of 20
EFTA00012153

EFTA00012154

Aircraft in such operating condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times under the Act.

Section 2.4 Replacement of Parts. The Grantor, at its own cost and expense, will promptly cause the replacement of all Parts which may from time to time become worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use for any reason whatsoever. In addition, the Grantor, at its own cost and expense, may permit the removal in the ordinary course of maintenance, service, repair, overhaul or testing of any Parts, whether or not worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, seized, confiscated, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered unfit for use; provided, however, that the Grantor, at its own cost and expense, will cause such Parts to be replaced as promptly as possible. All replacement Parts must be free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Liens), will be in as good operating condition as, and will have a value and utility at least substantially equal to, the Parts replaced, assuming such replaced Parts were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof. The Grantor's rights, title and interests in all Parts at any time removed from any item of Equipment will remain subject to the Lien of this Agreement no matter where located, until such time as such Parts are replaced by Parts which have been incorporated in such item of Equipment and which meet the requirements for replacement Parts specified above. Immediately upon any replacement Part becoming incorporated or installed in or attached to any item of Equipment as above provided, without further act, (a) the Grantor's rights, title and interests in such replacement Part will become subject to the Lien of this Agreement, and such replacement Part will be deemed part of such item of Equipment for all purposes hereof to the same extent as the Parts originally incorporated in such item of Equipment, and (b) the Grantor's rights, title and interests in the replaced Part will be released from the Lien of this Agreement and the replaced Part will no longer be deemed a Part hereunder. The Grantor will, not less often than once during each calendar year, provide to the Secured Party written confirmation, in form and content acceptable to the Secured Party, that the Grantor has complied with the provisions of this Section 2.4.

Section 2.5 Alterations, Modifications and Additions. The Grantor, at its own cost and expense, will cause such alterations and modifications in and additions to the Equipment to be made as may be required from time to time to meet the standards of the FAA and of any other governmental authority having jurisdiction and to maintain the certificate of airworthiness for the Aircraft; provided, however, that the validity or application of any such law, rule, regulation or order may be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings (but only so long as such proceedings do not, in the Secured Party's reasonable opinion, involve any material danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of any item of Equipment, or any interest, including the Secured Party's security interest or International Interest, therein or related thereto). In addition, the Grantor, at no cost or expense to the Secured Party, may, from time to time, cause such alterations and modifications in and additions to any item of Equipment to be made as the Grantor may deem desirable; provided, that no such alteration, modification and addition will (a) materially diminish the value, utility or condition of such item of Equipment below the value, utility or condition thereof immediately prior to such alteration, modification or addition, assuming the item of Equipment was then of the value and utility and in the condition required to be maintained by the terms of this Agreement, or (b) cause the airworthiness certification of the Aircraft to cease to be in good standing under the Act. The Grantor's rights, title and interests in all Parts added to the Aircraft, the Airframe, or an Engine as the result of such alteration, modification or addition will, without further act, be subject to the Lien of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence of this Section 2.5, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Grantor may remove any Part added to the Aircraft, Airframe, any or an Engine as contemplated in this Section 2.5 if (x) such Part is in addition to, and not in replacement of or substitution for, any Part originally incorporated in such item of Equipment at the time of delivery thereof or any Part in replacement of or substitution for any such Part, (y) such Part is not required to be incorporated or installed in or attached or added to such item of Equipment pursuant to the terms of this Article 2, and (z) such Part can be removed from such item of Equipment without causing any material damage thereto. Upon the removal of any Part as above provided, such Part will be released from the Lien of this Agreement.

Section 2.6 Maintenance of Other Engines. Each engine which does not constitute an Engine, but which is installed on the Airframe from time to time, will be maintained, operated, serviced, repaired, overhauled, altered, modified and tested in accordance with Section 2.3 to the same extent as if it were an Engine.

Section 2.7 Payment of Obligations. The Grantor hereby agrees that it will promptly pay or cause to be paid when due all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges imposed with respect to the Collateral (except to the extent being contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings which do not involve any material risk of loss or forfeiture).

Section 2.8 Change of Name or Location. Grantor will give Secured Party thirty (30) days prior written notice of any relocation of its chief executive office and of any change in its name, identity or state of organization. At least 10 Business Days prior to the occurrence of any such change or relocation, Grantor will (a) duly file appropriate financing statements in all applicable filing offices, and (b) deliver to Secured Party copies of the form of such financing statements. Grantor will hangar the Aircraft at N/A ("Primary Hangar Location"). Grantor will supply Secured Party with a waiver of any Lien or claim of Lien against the Aircraft which could be held by any landlord or mortgagee of

EFTA00012155

EFTA00012156

the hangar or future aircraft storage facility. Grantor will not remove the Aircraft, or permit the Aircraft to be removed, from its designated home airport for a period in excess of thirty (30) days, without the prior written consent of Secured Party.

Section 2.9 Inspection. Secured Party will have the right, but not the duty, to inspect the Aircraft, any component thereof, and the Records at any reasonable time and from time to time, wherever the same may be located, upon reasonable prior written notice to Grantor unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case no prior notice will be required. At Secured Party's request, Grantor will confirm to Secured Party the location of the Aircraft and will, at any reasonable time and from time to time, make the Aircraft and/or the Records available to Secured Party for inspection.

Section 2.10 Aircraft Registration: International Registry. Grantor will not change the United States Registration Number of the Aircraft without Secured Party's prior written consent. Grantor will cause to be filed with the FAA an FAA Bill of Sale, the Agreement, an FAA application for aircraft registration and such other documents as may be required under the Act or as otherwise necessary or prudent to cause the Aircraft to be and remain duly registered at all times with the FAA in the name of Grantor as owner and subject only to Secured Party's first priority perfected security interest. Grantor will, at all times, keep on board the Aircraft a current and valid Registration Application or Certificate of Aircraft Registration. Grantor will cause each International Interest in favor of the Secured Party in or relating to the Aircraft (including in the Airframe and each Engine) created by this Agreement and, if the Aircraft is acquired by Grantor on or after March 1, 2006, the contract of sale (i.e. the bill of sale) transferring title in the Aircraft to Grantor, in each case, to be validly registered with the International Registry with such International Interests having priority over all other registered or un-registered International Interests in the Airframe and Engines. Grantor will discharge or cause to be discharged any International Interest or Prospective International Interest in or relating to the Aircraft (including the Airframe and the Engine) not consented to in writing by Secured Party. Further, Grantor will not consent to any International Interest or Prospective International Interest in or relating to the Aircraft unless prior approval is obtained from the Secured Party in writing.

Section 2.11 Financial and Other Data. During the term of the Note and so long as any amounts are outstanding thereunder, Grantor agrees to furnish Secured Party:

a) a copy of Grantor's federal income tax return with all schedules attached thereto at the time such return is filed with the Internal Revenue Service and in any event within 120 days of the end of each calendar year;
b) promptly, such additional financial and other information as Secured Party may from time to time reasonably request.

All such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. So long as Grantor is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is timely filing the reports required thereunder to the Securities Exchange Commission, Grantor will have no obligation to furnish its financial statements as provided above.

Section 2.12 Late Payments. If Grantor fails to pay any amount due hereunder, after the expiration of any applicable grace period, Grantor shall pay to Secured Party a late payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the amount unpaid. Such fee shall be payable on demand and shall constitute part of the Obligations. In addition, if Grantor fails to perform any of its obligations contained herein, Secured Party may (but will not be obligated to) itself perform such obligations, and the amount of the reasonable costs and expenses of Secured Party incurred in connection with such performance, together with interest on such amount from the date said amounts are expended at the Default Rate, will be payable by Grantor to Secured Party upon demand. No such performance by Secured Party will be deemed a waiver of any rights or remedies of Secured Party or be deemed to cure any Default of Grantor hereunder. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, or if the Note is accelerated in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal and all accrued interest, as well as any other charges due Lender hereunder, shall bear interest from the date on which such amount shall have first become due and payable to Lender to the date on which such amount shall be paid to Lender (whether before or after judgment), at a default rate, to be determined by Lender in its sole discretion from time to time, equal to up to six percentage points (6.0%) in excess of the otherwise applicable rate of interest, not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the "Default Rate").

Section 2.13 Transaction Expenses. Grantor will pay all actual and reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by Secured Party in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, including appraisal fees, Secured Party's counsel fees and expenses, FAA counsel fees and expenses, FAA, International Registry and UCC title and lien searches, reports, filing, registration and recording fees, charges and taxes. Grantor also agrees to pay all fees and expenses of Secured Party's counsel, FAA counsel and all other third parties who are engaged by Secured Party to update any FAA, International

EFTA00012157

EFTA00012158

Registry or UCC title and/or lien reports and/or to review, file, register and record any and all documents and instruments as required by Secured Party, the International Registry or the FAA at any time during which any of the Obligations remain outstanding.

## Section 2.14 Reserved.

Section 2.15 Engine Maintenance. (a) Both Engines shall at all times be covered by the Engine Maintenance Agreement, or another service and maintenance contract in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Secured Party (i.e., taken as a whole, substantially as protective as the referenced agreement) which provides for the maintenance or overhaul of such property. (b) Grantor will execute and deliver, and cause to be executed and delivered, to Secured Party, an aircraft interest holder's agreement among Grantor, Secured Party, and Service Provider with respect to the Engine Maintenance Agreement, such agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Secured Party. (c) Grantor will accurately and promptly report to Service Provider the applicable hours pursuant to, and in accordance with, the power by the hour provisions of the Engine Maintenance Agreement. (d) Without Secured Party's prior written consent, Grantor will not seek, agree to or permit, directly or indirectly, (i) the cancellation or termination of the Engine Maintenance Agreement or (ii) the amendment, waiver or other change to any material term of or applicable to the Engine Maintenance Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 2.15 (d), "material" means any modification, waiver, or amendment of the Engine Maintenance Agreement which, in the judgment of Secured Party, would (A) adversely affect any of Secured Party's rights or remedies under the Loan Documents or Secured Party's security interest in or other Lien on the Collateral (including the priority of Secured Party's interests) or (B) create or result in an Event of Default.

Section 2.16 Continued Subordination. Grantor will continue to subordinate the payment of any note(s) payable obligations in the amount of $2,500,000.00 owed to ThorSport, Inc. by Grantor until such time as the Obligations of Grantor to Secured Party are paid in full. Interest only payments are permitted without Secured Party's consent, but principal payments require the consent of Secured Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

## ARTICLE 3 -- EVENTS OF LOSS

Section 3.1 Event of Loss with Respect to the Aircraft. Grantor will deliver to Secured Party written notice of the occurrence of any Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft within five (5) days after the occurrence thereof. On the next Note Payment Date following such Event of Loss Grantor will pay to Secured Party an amount equal to the sum of (A) all amounts then due hereunder, under any other Loan Documents, and under the Note, plus (B) the Loss Value of the Aircraft determined as of such Note Payment Date. Upon payment in full by the Grantor of all such amounts, the Aircraft having suffered the Event of Loss will be released from the lien of this Agreement and the Secured Party will execute and deliver, at the Grantor's cost and expense, such instruments as may be reasonably required to evidence such release.

Section 3.2 Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Grantor will deliver to Secured Party written notice of the occurrence of any Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe within five (5) days after the occurrence thereof. Within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, Grantor will convey to Secured Party, as replacement for the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, a security interest to and International Interest in an engine that is (a) the same make and model number as the Engine suffering the Event of Loss, (b) free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, (c) of a value, utility, and useful life equal to, and in as good an operating condition as, the Engine suffering the Event of Loss, assuming such Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Grantor, at its sole cost and expense, will furnish Secured Party with such documents to evidence the conveyance and the International Interest and shall make such filings and registrations with the FAA and the International Registry (and hereby consents to such registrations with the International Registry) with respect thereto, in each case, as Secured Party reasonably requests. Upon full compliance by Grantor with the terms of this paragraph, Secured Party will release Secured Party's right, title and interest, if any, in and to the Engine suffering the Event of Loss. Each replacement engine will, after such conveyance, be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein and will be deemed part of the same Aircraft as was the replaced Engine. No Event of Loss with respect to an Engine will result in any reduction or delay in the payment of any amounts due under the Note or hereunder, or otherwise relieve Grantor of any obligation under this Agreement.

Section 3.3 Application of Payments from Governmental Authorities or other Persons. Any payments (other than insurance proceeds, the application of which is provided for in Article 4), received at any time by the Secured Party or Grantor from any governmental authority or other Person with respect to any Event of Loss, or from a governmental authority with respect to an event which does not constitute an Event of Loss, will be applied as follows:

a) Such payments will be applied in reduction of the Grantor's obligation to pay the Loss Value, if not already paid by the Grantor, or, if already paid by the Grantor, will be applied to reimburse the Grantor for its

EFTA00012159

EFTA00012160

payment of such amounts. The balance, if any, of such payment remaining thereafter, and after payment of all amounts then due and payable under the Loan Documents, will be paid to the Grantor.

b) If such payments are received with respect to a requisition for use by the government which does not constitute an Event of Loss, such payments may be retained by the Grantor.

c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3, any payments (other than insurance proceeds, the application of which is provided for in Article 4) received at any time by the Secured Party from any governmental authority or other Person with respect to any Event of Loss, which are payable to the Grantor, will not be paid to the Grantor if at the time of such payment an Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing, in which event all such amounts will be paid to and held by the Secured Party as security for the Obligations or, at the Secured Party's option, applied by the Secured Party toward the payment of such Obligations at the time due in such order of application as the Secured Party may from time to time elect.

GRANTOR WILL NOT SELL, TRANSFER, ASSIGN, CHARTER, LEASE, CONVEY, PLEDGE, MORTGAGE OR OTHERWISE ENCUMBER THE AIRCRAFT OR THIS AGREEMENT, AND ANY SUCH ATTEMPTED SALE, TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT, CHARTER, LEASE, CONVEYANCE, PLEDGE, MORTGAGE OR ENCUMBRANCE, WHETHER BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE OF NO FORCE OR EFFECT WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF SECURED PARTY. IN ADDITION, GRANTOR WILL NOT ENTER INTO ANY INTERCHANGE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRCRAFT OR RELINQUISH POSSESSION OF THE AIRCRAFT OR ANY ENGINE, OR INSTALL ANY ENGINE OR PART, OR PERMIT ANY ENGINE OR PART TO BE INSTALLED, ON ANY AIRFRAME OTHER THAN THE AIRFRAME DESCRIBED HEREIN. No consent by Secured Party to any of the foregoing will in any event relieve Grantor of primary, absolute and unconditional liability for its duties and obligations under this Agreement. Secured Party, at any time with or without notice to Grantor, may sell, transfer, assign and/or grant a security interest in all or any part of Secured Party's interest in the Loan Documents or the Aircraft or any part thereof (each, a "Secured Party Transfer") and Grantor hereby expressly consents in advance to any such assignment by Secured Party of the Loan Documents and Secured Party's associated rights therein, including in connection therewith any assignment of Secured Party International Interests assigned or created hereunder in or relating to the Aircraft. Any purchaser, transferee, assignee or secured party of Secured Party (each a "Secured Party Assignee") will have and may exercise all of Secured Party's rights hereunder with respect to the items to which any such Secured Party Transfer relates, and Grantor will not assert against any Secured Party Assignee any claim Grantor may have against Secured Party, provided Grantor may assert any such claim in a separate action against Secured Party. Upon receipt of written notice of a Secured Party Transfer, Grantor will promptly acknowledge in writing its obligations under this Agreement, will comply with the written directions or demands of any Secured Party Assignee and will make all payments due under the assigned Agreement as directed in writing by the Secured Party Assignee. Following such Secured Party Transfer, the term "Secured Party" will be deemed to include or refer to each Secured Party Assignee. Grantor will provide reasonable assistance to Secured Party to complete any transaction contemplated by this subsection. Subject to the restriction on assignment contained in this subsection, this Agreement inures to the benefit of, and is binding upon, the successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

Section 8.7 Benefit of Parties, Successors and Assigns; Entire Agreement. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein or delivered in connection herewith will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Grantor and the Secured Party and their respective legal representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements of such parties.

Section 8.8 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time, upon the reasonable request of the Secured Party, the Grantor will promptly and duly execute and deliver any and all such further instruments and documents and take such action (including providing any necessary consents) with the International Registry as may be reasonably specified in such request, and as are reasonably necessary to perfect, preserve or protect the security interests, International Interests and assignments created or intended to be created hereby, or to obtain for the Secured Party the full benefit of the specific rights and powers herein granted and assigned, including the execution and delivery of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and continuation statements with respect thereto, or similar instruments relating to the perfection of the mortgage, security interests, International Interests or assignments created or intended to be created hereby.

In its discretion, the Secured Party may (but will not be obligated to), at any time and from time to time (regardless of whether or not a Default or an Event of Default has occurred), for the account of the Grantor, pay any amount required to be paid by the Grantor hereunder, or do any act required of the Grantor hereunder, and which the Grantor fails to pay or do at the time required, and any such payment will be repayable to the Secured Party by the Grantor on demand, will bear interest at the Default Rate, and will be secured by the Collateral.

Section 8.10 Indemnity. Grantor will indemnify and hold harmless Secured Party and each Secured Party Assignee, on an after tax basis, from and against any and all liabilities, causes of action, claims, suits, penalties, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), obligations, demands and judgments (collectively, a "Liability") arising out of or in any way related to: (a) Grantor's failure to perform any covenant under any of the Loan Documents, (b) the untruth of any representation or warranty made by Grantor under the Loan Documents, (c) the order, manufacture, purchase, ownership, selection, acceptance, rejection, possession, rental, sublease, operation, use, maintenance, control, loss, damage, destruction, removal, storage, surrender, sale, condition, delivery, return or other disposition of or any other matter relating to the Aircraft, or (d) injury to persons, property or the environment including any Liability based on strict liability in tort, negligence, breach of warranties or Grantor's failure to comply fully with applicable law or regulatory requirements; provided, that the foregoing indemnity will not extend to any Liability to the extent resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Secured Party.

Section 8.11 Amendments. Neither this Agreement, nor any of the terms hereof, may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or modified orally, but only by an instrument in writing which is signed by the party against whom the enforcement of the termination, amendment, supplement, waiver or modification is sought.

Section 8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. SECURED PARTY AND GRANTOR HEREBY EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AIRCRAFT OR THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. THIS WAIVER IS MADE KNOWINGLY, WILLINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY SECURED PARTY AND GRANTOR, WHO EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY ANY INDIVIDUAL TO INDUCE THIS WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OR IN ANY WAY TO MODIFY OR NULLIFY ITS EFFECT. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO. GRANTOR AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE SECURED PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON INDEMNIFIED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

Section 8.13 Counterpart Execution: Joint and Several Liability. This Agreement and any amendments to this Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, will be an original, but all such counterparts will together constitute but one and the same instrument. Fully executed sets of counterparts will be delivered to, and retained by, the Grantor and the Secured Party. If this Agreement is executed by more than one Person as Grantor, the obligations of all such signers hereunder will be joint and several and all references to "Grantor" will apply both jointly and severally.

# FIRST AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT SECURITY AGREEMENT (S/N RK-244)

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT SECURITY AGREEMENT (S/N RK-244) (this "Amendment") is made as of January 10, 2013, by and between FLIGHT OPTIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Borrower") and THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, as collateral agent ("Agent") for the Lenders (as defined in the Security Agreement defined below).

## RECITALS

A. Borrower has executed an Aircraft Security Agreement (S/N RK-244) dated as of November 16, 2011 (as amended and assigned from time to time, the "Security Agreement"), in favor of Agent as more fully described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part thereof. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, Borrower has granted Agent for the benefit of Lenders a first priority security interest, security assignment and lien, in, against, under and with respect to all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under certain collateral, including, without limitation, a Raytheon Aircraft Company model 400A aircraft bearing manufacturer's serial number RK-244 and U.S. Registration No. N493LX, as more fully described on Exhibit A hereto (the "Aircraft").

B. Borrower and Agent have agreed to modify certain provisions of the Security Agreement.

C. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Security Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Security Agreement Amendments. From and after the date of this Amendment:

(a) The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Section 2.4(i) in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

"(i) Borrower may sell the Aircraft at any time after the Lien in the Aircraft has been released in accordance with Section 3.5 thereof; and"

(b) The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Section 3.5 thereof in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

"3.5 Release of Lien. Upon receipt by Lenders on or before the date set forth on Annex H hereto of the Release Payment (to be allocated among Lenders based on their respective pro rata share of the Obligations) in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon through such date, if applicable, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, Lenders shall release the aircraft identified on such Annex corresponding to such Release Payment from the Lien of the applicable security agreement in favor of Lender. For purposes thereof, "Release Payment" means, for any Aircraft or group of Aircraft, the payment specified by reference to Annex H hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent at any time that the Release Payment exceeds the aggregate unpaid Obligations, then the aggregate Release Payment for any and all remaining aircraft indicated on Annex H at such time shall equal the aggregate unpaid Obligations."

(c) The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Annex D to the Security Agreement in its entirety and replacing it with Annex D in the form set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part thereof.

(d) The Security Agreement is hereby amended to delete Annex E to the Security Agreement in its entirety and replacing it with Annex E in the form set forth on Exhibit C attached hereto and made a part thereof.

(e) The Security Agreement is hereby amended to add Annex H to the Security Agreement in the form set forth on Exhibit D attached hereto and made a part thereof.

2. References in Security Agreement. Each and every reference in the Security Agreement to "this Agreement" is deemed for all purposes to reference the Security Agreement as amended pursuant to this Amendment unless the context clearly indicates or dictates a contrary meaning.

3. Ratification; Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby agrees for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and their respective successors and assigns that nothing contained herein shall be construed in any manner to in any manner affect, impair, lessen, release, cancel, terminate or extinguish the indebtedness, liabilities or obligations of Borrower under the Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents. In no event shall this Amendment be deemed a waiver, discharge, substitution or replacement of the Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms in all respects all of its indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under the Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents and agrees that, except as expressly modified by this Amendment, the Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect as if set forth specifically herein. As a precautionary matter, as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance as and when due of all of the Obligations, Borrower hereby ratifies, confirms and re-grants to Agent for the benefit of Lenders a first priority security interest in and lien on, and consents to the registration of an international interest in, and collaterally assigns to Agent, all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the Collateral.

4. Representations. Borrower hereby represents, warrants and agrees that: (a) the Recitals to this Amendment are true and accurate in each and every respect and are all incorporated by reference herein; (b) each and every of its representations and warranties set forth in the Loan Documents continues to remain true, accurate and complete as if the same were made on the date hereof; (b) this Amendment, the Security Agreement as modified hereby and the other Loan Documents are the valid and legally binding obligations of Borrower, fully enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their terms; (c) the terms of the Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents have not heretofore been amended or modified by any action or omission or course of conduct on the part of Agent or either Lender (other than by a formal written agreement executed by Lenders), nor has Agent or either Lender waived or relinquished any of their rights, powers or remedies under the Loan Documents; (d) the payment and performance of the Obligations are, and shall, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, continue to be, secured by, among other things, the Financed Aircraft, the Additional Aircraft and the other collateral described in the Loan Documents; (e) Agent has a first priority perfected security interest in, and lien on, the Financed Aircraft, the Additional Aircraft and the other collateral described in the Loan Documents; (f) the aircraft described in Exhibit B hereto are the Financed Aircraft for all purposes of the Loan Documents; and (g) the aircraft described in Exhibit C hereto are the Additional Aircraft for all purposes of the Loan Documents. If any of the foregoing representations and warranties shall prove to be false, incorrect or misleading in any material respect, Agent or either Lender may, in its absolute and sole discretion, declare that a default has occurred and exists under the Loan Documents, and Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents as the result of the occurrence of such default.

5. Expenses of Agent and Lenders. Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse Agent and Lenders upon demand for all expenses of Agent and Lenders (including the fees and expenses of their legal counsel and FAA Counsel) in connection with (a) the preparation of this Amendment and the other documents executed and/or delivered in connection herewith; and (b) the filing of this Amendment with the FAA and the registrations with the International Registry in connection therewith.

6. Release. Borrower hereby waives, releases and forever discharges Agent and each Lender and the other Indemnified Parties of and from any and all indemnified liabilities (as defined in the Security Agreement) arising, directly or indirectly, out of or in connection with any of any act, omission, representation or any other matter whatsoever or thing done, omitted or suffered to be done by any Indemnified Party that has occurred in whole or in part at any time up to and immediately preceding the moment of the execution of this

2581729

(RK-244 AMENDMENT)

EFTA00012217

EFTA00012218

Amendment, including, but not limited to, the negotiation, making, borrowing, administration, enforcement and/or collection of the Loan Documents.

7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Amendment shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of both parties shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of laws principles of such state, other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law), including all matters of construction, validity, and performance. Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in any way in connection with this Amendment may be instituted or brought in the courts of the State of New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, as Agent may elect, or in any other state or Federal court as Agent shall deem appropriate, and by execution and delivery of this Amendment, Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court, and to all proceedings in such courts. BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AMENDMENT OR ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.

8. Miscellaneous.

(a) Upon the request of Agent, Borrower, at its sole cost and expense, shall execute and deliver to Agent such further instruments and shall do and cause to be done such further acts with respect to the Security Agreement, this Amendment and any other document executed in connection herewith as Agent may deem necessary or desirable in Agent's sole discretion to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes of this Amendment and the Security Agreement.

(b) This Amendment and the Security Agreement contain the entire agreement among Agent and Borrower regarding the subject matter hereof and completely and fully supersede all other prior agreements, both written and oral, among Agent and Borrower relating to the subject matter hereof. Neither Agent nor Borrower shall hereafter have any rights under such prior agreements but shall look solely to this Amendment and the Security Agreement for the definition and determination of all of their respective rights, liabilities and responsibilities relating to the subject matter hereof. The headings in this Amendment are for convenience only and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the terms hereof.

(c) No modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Amendment, nor any consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall be effective until and unless it is in writing and signed by Agent, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which when taken together shall constitute but a single instrument.

(d) All of the terms and conditions of this Amendment shall survive the execution and delivery of this Amendment and the performance and repayment of the Obligations.

(e) In the event that any provision of this Amendment is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, then such provision only shall be deemed null and void and shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain operative and in full force and effect.

(f) This Amendment shall be binding upon Borrower and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Agent and Lenders and their respective successors and assigns. Time is of the essence with regard to this Amendment.

(a) Borrower (i) is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership or operation of its assets requires such qualification, including the jurisdiction of the primary hangar location of the Aircraft, other than any such jurisdiction as to which the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) has the necessary limited liability company authority and power to own and operate the Aircraft and its other material assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged; (iii) is a "citizen of the United States" within the meaning of the Transportation Code; and (iv) has full limited liability company power, authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to grant the security interest, security assignment and Lien created by this Agreement;

The Aircraft at all times will be operated by duly qualified pilots having satisfied all requirements established and specified by the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration, any other applicable governmental authority and the insurance policies required under this Agreement.

(b) Borrower will operate the Aircraft in a careful and proper manner in compliance with all Applicable Standards, including, without limitation, its operation, maintenance and security. The Aircraft shall not be operated, used or located outside the continental United States, except that it may be flown temporarily to any country in the world for any purpose expressly permitted under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Aircraft shall not be flown, operated, used or located in, to or over any such country or area (temporarily or otherwise), (i) that is excluded from the insurance required hereunder (or specifically not covered by such insurance), (ii) with which the United States does not maintain favorable diplomatic relations, (iii) in any area of recognized or threatened hostilities, (iv) to the extent that payment of any claim under the insurance required hereunder directly or indirectly arising or resulting from or connected with any such flight, operation, use or location would be prohibited under any trade or other economic sanction or embargo by the United States of America, or (v) in violation of this Agreement or any Applicable Standards, including any U.S. law or United Nations Security Council Directive.

(c) Borrower will, at its own expense, (i) maintain, inspect, service, repair, overhaul and test the Airframe, each Engine, any APU and each Part in accordance with Applicable Standards; (ii) make any alteration or modification to the Aircraft that may at any time be required to comply with Applicable Standards, to cause the Aircraft to remain airworthy or to maintain the Aircraft's airworthiness certification; (iii) furnish all parts, replacements, mechanisms, devices and servicing required therefor so that the condition and operating efficiency of the applicable Airframe, Engine, APU or Part will at all times be no less than its condition and operating efficiency as and when delivered to Borrower, ordinary wear and tear from proper use alone excepted; (iv) promptly replace all Parts that become worn out, lost, stolen, taken, destroyed, damaged beyond repair or permanently rendered or declared unfit for use for any reason whatsoever; (v) maintain (in English) all Records in accordance with Applicable Standards; and (vi) enroll and maintain the Airframe in a Computerized Maintenance Monitoring Program and the Engines in the Engine Maintenance Program.

If the number of flight hours on the Airframe in any year of operation (based on a 12-month period commencing on the Closing Date and each 12-month period thereafter) is in excess of the flight hours limitation set forth on Annex B hereto, then Borrower shall pay Agent an amount equal to the per hour charge set forth on Annex B hereto for each flight hour during such 12-month period in excess of such flight hours limitation. Agent shall apply such payment as a partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty. Such payment shall be made to Agent on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after each annual anniversary of the Closing Date.

(e) Borrower will not make or authorize any improvement, change, addition or alteration to the Aircraft that will impair the originally intended function or use of the Aircraft, diminish the value of the Aircraft as it existed immediately prior thereto, or violate any Applicable Standard; and any Part,

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)

EFTA00012247

EFTA00012248

mechanism, device or replacement added to the Aircraft in connection therewith shall immediately, without further act, become part of the Aircraft and subject to the security interest, security assignment and Lien created by this Agreement.

(f) Borrower shall prominently display on the Aircraft the FAA Registration number specified in Annex C hereto. If requested by Agent in writing, Borrower shall, at its expense, attach to the Aircraft a notice satisfactory to Agent disclosing Agent's security interest in the Aircraft.

(h) Borrower shall implement all security measures and systems required by any governmental authority, or by any insurance policies or that are necessary or appropriate for the proper protection of the Aircraft (whether on the ground or in flight) against theft, vandalism, hijacking, destruction, bombing, terrorism or similar acts. Upon Agent's request (but without Agent having any obligation with respect to Borrower's compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(h)), Borrower shall provide Agent with evidence of Borrower's compliance with its obligations under this Section 2.5(h).

## 2.6 Insurance.

(a) Borrower agrees to maintain at all times, at its sole cost and expense, with insurers of recognized reputation and responsibility satisfactory to Agent (but in no event having an A.M. Best or comparable agency rating of less than "A-"):

(ii) "all-risk" ground, taxiing, and flight hull insurance on an agreed-value basis, covering the Aircraft, provided that such insurance shall at all times be in an amount not less than the full replacement value of the Aircraft (as determined by Agent in its reasonable judgment) (such amount re-determined as of each anniversary of the Closing Date for the next succeeding year throughout the term of this Agreement); and

(iii) war risk and allied perils (including confiscation, appropriation, expropriation, terrorism and hijacking insurance) in the amount of $50,000,000 for liability insurance and in the amount required in paragraph (b) above for hull insurance.

(b) Any policies of insurance carried in accordance with this Section 2.6 and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement of any such policies shall (i) be endorsed to name Agent and Lenders as additional insureds as their interests may appear (but without responsibility for premiums), (ii) provide, with respect to insurance carried in accordance with Section 2.6(a)(ii) or (a)(iii) above, that any amount payable thereunder shall be paid directly to Agent as sole loss payee and not to Agent and Borrower jointly, (iii) provide for thirty (30) days' (seven (7) days' in the case of war, hijacking and allied perils) prior written notice by such insurer of cancellation, (iv) include a severability of interest clause providing that such policy shall operate in the same manner as if there were a separate policy covering

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)

EFTA00012249

EFTA00012250

each insured, (v) waive any right of set-off against Agent and/or Lenders, and any rights of subrogation against Agent and/or Lenders, (vi) provide that in respect of the interests of Agent and Lenders in such policies, that the insurance shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction of Borrower or any other Person operating or in possession of the Aircraft, regardless of any breach or violation of any warranties, declarations or conditions contained in such policies by or binding upon Borrower or any other Person operating or in possession of the Aircraft, and (vii) be primary, not subject to any co-insurance clause and shall be without right of contribution from any other insurance. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and no Event of Loss with respect to the Aircraft has occurred, any amount payable to Agent pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be paid if (A) $200,000.00, or more, in the aggregate, to Agent and Borrower, jointly, as their interests may appear, and released by Agent to Borrower or other appropriate Persons in payment of the costs actually incurred with respect to repairs made to the Aircraft so as to restore it to the operating condition required by this Agreement, or shall be disbursed by Agent as otherwise required by this Agreement, or (B) less than $200,000.00 in the aggregate, to Borrower (and such amounts shall be applied by Borrower to pay the costs of such repairs). Borrower shall consult with Agent prior to agreeing to any settlement or adjustment of any claim in respect of damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any Part, where the cost of replacement or fair market value of the damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any Part, is in excess of $200,000.00.

(c) All of the coverages required herein shall be in full force and effect worldwide throughout any geographical areas to, in or over which the Aircraft is operated. Borrower shall not self-insure (by deductible, premium adjustment, or risk retention arrangement of any kind) the insurance required to be maintained hereunder. All insurance proceeds payable under the requisite policies shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. Borrower agrees that it shall obtain and maintain such other insurance coverages, or cause adjustments to be made to the scope, amount or other aspects of the existing insurance coverages, as promptly as practicable upon Agent's request, as and when Agent, in the exercise of its good faith credit discretion, deems such additional insurance coverages or modifications to be appropriate in light of any changes in Applicable Standards, the insurance market, Borrower's anticipated use of the Aircraft or other pertinent circumstances.

(d) Annually on or before the anniversary of the policy expiration date, Borrower shall furnish to Agent evidence of insurance coverage in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent evidencing that Borrower has obtained the insurance coverages required herein for a twelve (12) month or greater period commencing from and after such anniversary date, and, if Agent shall so request, a copy of the applicable policies. In the event Borrower shall fail to maintain insurance as herein provided, Agent and/or Lenders may, at their option, provide such insurance, and Borrower shall, upon demand, reimburse Agent and/or Lenders for the cost thereof, together with interest at the highest default rate of interest provided for in the Loan Documents from the date of payment through the date of reimbursement.

## 2.7 Event of Loss.

(a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe and/or the Aircraft, Borrower shall notify Agent of any such Event of Loss within five (5) Business Days of the date thereof. Borrower shall pay Agent, within forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, in immediately available funds the greater of (i) all insurance proceeds received by Borrower in connection with such Event of Loss, and (ii) the Minimum Payment set forth on Annex G hereto corresponding to the month in which such payment occurs, together with any principal installment then due and payable under the Obligations and all interest accrued on the Obligations through the date of payment to Agent, first, to be applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such order and manner as Agent may elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be disbursed to Borrower; and (y) if the unpaid principal balance of any of the Notes is reduced by such Minimum Payment, the principal installments set forth in Exhibit A to such Note shall be deemed amended from and after the payment date immediately following the sale date to reflect the amortization of the then unpaid principal balance of such Note over the remaining payment dates as determined by Agent in its sole discretion. Upon indefeasible payment in full of such amounts and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)

EFTA00012251

EFTA00012252

Aircraft shall be released from the security interest of this Agreement, and Agent shall discharge all registrations with the International Registry with respect to the Aircraft.

(b) Upon an Event of Loss with respect to any Engine or APU under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, Borrower shall, within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, replace such Engine or APU, as applicable, and grant to Agent a first priority security interest and security assignment in a similar or better engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable. Such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall be of the same make and model number as the Engine or APU suffering the Event of Loss and shall be free and clear of all Liens and shall have a value, utility and useful life at least equal to, and be in as good an operating condition as, the Engine or APU suffering the Event of Loss, assuming such Engine or APU was in the condition and repair required by the terms thereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Borrower, at its own cost and expense, shall furnish Agent with such documents to evidence such conveyance and make such filings as Agent shall request to subject such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, to the lien of this Agreement. Each such replacement engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall, after such conveyance be deemed an "Engine" or "APU" (as defined herein), as applicable, and shall be deemed part of the same Aircraft as was the Engine or APU replaced thereby.

(c) Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all proceeds payable by any insurer with respect to an Event of Loss, by any manufacturer with respect to a Return to Manufacturer or by any governmental authority with respect to any Requisition of Use, as the case may be; provided, however, that so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and Borrower has complied with the provisions of this Section 2.7, then Agent shall remit such proceeds to Borrower.

(d) If the Airframe, any Engine, APU or major Part has suffered any damage requiring the FAA to be notified of such damage by use of an FAA Form 337 or otherwise, then within ten (10) days of such notification to the FAA, Borrower shall notify Agent of such damage, and Agent and Borrower shall consult for the purpose of determining the diminished value of the Aircraft resulting from such damage history. The diminished value of the Aircraft shall be the amount by which the fair market sales value of the Aircraft without such damage history exceeds the fair market sales value of the Aircraft with such damage history. For purposes hereof, fair market sales value shall be determined on the following basis: (i) the value shall be the amount which would be obtained in an arm's length transaction between an informed and willing buyer (who is not a used aircraft dealer), and an informed and willing seller under no compulsion to sell; (ii) the costs of removal of the Aircraft from its then location shall not be a deduction from such value; and (iii) in determining any such value, it shall be assumed (whether or not the same be true) that the Aircraft has been maintained by Borrower and is in the condition in which it is required to be in accordance with this Agreement and that the total number of Airframe flight hours (including any component with hourly overhaul schedules) accumulated from the Closing Date to the date of such damage do not exceed the product of the flight hours limitation set forth in Annex B hereto times the number of twelve month periods and any portion thereof from the Closing Date to such date.

Within ten (10) days after Borrower and Agent agree upon the diminished value of the Aircraft, Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment Agent shall apply as a partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty. If Borrower and Agent cannot agree on the diminished value of the Aircraft within ten (10) days after notification of such damage to the FAA, then Agent shall appoint an independent appraiser (reasonably acceptable to Borrower) to determine such value. Borrower agrees to pay the costs and expenses of any such determination and appraisal. The independent appraiser shall be required to complete such determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event, not later than forty (40) days after the date on which it is appointed. A final determination by the independent appraiser regarding the extent of any diminished value of the Aircraft shall be binding on Borrower and Agent. Within ten (10) days after the independent appraiser's determination of the diminished value of the Aircraft, Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment Lenders shall apply as a partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty.

As collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance as and when due of all of the Obligations and in order to induce Lenders to amend the Existing Documents, Borrower hereby grants, pledges and assigns to Agent (for the benefit of Lenders) a first priority security interest, security assignment and Lien, in, against, under and with respect to all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the following collateral, whether now existing or hereafter acquired (collectively, the "Collateral"): (i) the Aircraft, including the Airframe, each of the Engines, the APU and the Records; (ii) the Parts; (iii) any and all present and future Third Party Agreements; (iv) any and all other associated rights secured by or associated with the Airframe and/or the Engines, together with any related international interests; and (v) all proceeds of the foregoing. The foregoing shall not be deemed in any way whatsoever as an agreement by Agent or Lenders to permit or allow Borrower to enter into any Third Party Agreements, and Borrower shall only be allowed to enter into any of the foregoing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or otherwise, neither Agent nor either Lender assumes, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, any obligations, liabilities and/or duties of any kind whatsoever of Borrower (and/or of any other Person) under, or with respect to, the Collateral, and neither Agent nor either Lender shall be responsible in any way whatsoever for the performance of any obligations, liabilities and/or duties of any kind whatsoever by Borrower (and/or by any other Person) in connection with, relating to, or arising under, the Collateral.

3.2 Agent Appointed as Attorney-in-Fact. Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Agent and any employee, officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in the place and stead of Borrower and in the name of Borrower or in its own name, from time to time in Agent's sole discretion, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, and Borrower hereby further irrevocably authorizes Agent and any employee, officer or agent thereof to take any and all appropriate action and to make, execute, deliver, file and/or record any and all instruments or documents (including, without limitation, any FAA filings, UCC financing statements or UCC amendments or any control agreements) and to make, cause to be made and/or consent to all registrations with the International Registry that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. This appointment is coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and shall terminate only upon indefeasible payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower hereby further agrees that (i) Agent shall have authority, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to endorse Borrower's name on any checks, notes, drafts or any other payments or instruments relating to the Collateral and constituting Collateral that come into Agent's or either Lender's possession or control and to settle, adjust, receive payment and make claim or proof of loss and (ii) Borrower shall not file or record any corrective or termination statements with respect to any UCC financing statements, amendments or assignments or control agreements filed or recorded by or for the benefit of Agent with respect to any of the Collateral and shall not discharge or allow to be discharged any international interest or other Registerable Interest created in favor of Agent hereunder or under the Loan Documents prior to the indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The powers conferred on Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to Borrower for any act or failure to act.

3.3 Consent to Registration of International Interest. Borrower hereby (a) consents to the registration of any international interest or other Registerable Interest arising in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents and any subordination, amendment, discharge or undertaking permitted by the Cape Town Convention with respect thereto, and (b) authorizes its professional user entity to consent to such registration (including all final consents thereto), upon request therefor by Agent. At closing, Borrower hereby agrees to further authorize its professional user entity to consent to any and all such registrations.

3.4 Inspection. Agent or its authorized representatives shall have the right, but not the duty, to inspect the Aircraft, any part thereof and/or the Records, at any reasonable time and from time to time, wherever located, upon reasonable prior written notice to Borrower; except that no advance notice shall be necessary prior to any inspection conducted, and such inspection may be conducted at any time, after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Upon request of Agent, Borrower shall promptly provide Agent with notice of the location of the Aircraft and with all Records. Borrower shall be responsible for the reasonable cost of any inspection conducted after the occurrence of an Event of Default and shall pay Agent such amount promptly upon demand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, Agent shall be permitted to conduct not more than two (2) such inspections during any fiscal year of Borrower.

3.5 Release of Lien. So long as no Default or Event of Default then exists or would result therefrom, Agent hereby agrees to release the Aircraft and other Collateral from the Lien of this Agreement upon the payment of the Sale Payment in connection with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to Section 2.4 above.

SECTION 4. Events of Default. The term "Event of Default", wherever used herein, shall mean:

(a) Borrower shall fail to pay any Obligation within five (5) Business Days after the same shall become due and payable (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration, upon demand or otherwise); or

(b) Borrower shall default in the payment or performance of any indebtedness, liability or obligation to (i) Agent or either Lender or any Affiliate of either Lender, the amount of which, whether accelerated or otherwise, is in excess of $250,000.00, or (ii) any other Person, the amount of which, whether accelerated or otherwise, is in excess of $500,000.00, and in each case any applicable grace period with respect thereto has expired; or

(c) Borrower shall fail to keep in full force and effect any of the insurance coverages required under this Agreement or shall operate the Aircraft at a time when, or at a place in which, such insurance shall not be in effect; or

(d) Borrower shall fail to maintain, use or operate the Aircraft in compliance with this Agreement; or

(e) Borrower shall (except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Agreement) sell, assign, charter, lease, timeshare, pool, interchange, convey, mortgage, exchange or otherwise transfer or relinquish possession of or dispose of, or create, assume or suffer to exist any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) on or with respect to, the Aircraft, any part thereof or any of the other Collateral, or Borrower's interest therein, or attempt or offer to do any of the foregoing, or permit the same to occur; or

(f) Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any agreement (other than those specifically referred to in this Section 4) required to be performed or observed by it under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and such failure shall continue uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Agent to Borrower (but such notice and cure period will not be applicable unless such breach is curable by practical means within such notice period); or

(g) any representation or warranty made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any agreement, document or certificate delivered by Borrower in connection herewith or pursuant hereto shall prove to have been incorrect, misleading, or inaccurate in any material respect when such representation or warranty was made or given (or, if a continuing representation or warranty, at any time); or

(h) Borrower shall (i) generally fail to pay its debts as they became due, admit its inability to pay its debts or obligations generally as they fall due, or shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or a voluntary petition or an answer seeking reorganization in a proceeding under any bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, or an answer admitting the material allegations of such a petition filed against Borrower in any such proceeding; or (ii) by voluntary petition, answer or consent, seek relief under the provisions of

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)
EFTA00012257

EFTA00012258

any other bankruptcy or other insolvency or similar law providing for the reorganization or liquidation of companies, or providing for an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or providing for an agreement, composition, extension or adjustment with its creditors; or

(i) a petition against Borrower in a proceeding under applicable bankruptcy laws or other insolvency laws, as now or hereafter in effect, shall be filed and shall not be withdrawn or dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter, or if, under the provisions of any law providing for reorganization or liquidation of companies that may apply to Borrower, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume jurisdiction, custody or control of Borrower or of any substantial part of its property and such jurisdiction, custody or control shall remain in force unrelinquished, unstayed or unterminated for a period of sixty (60) days after the filing date; or

(j) any judgment, attachment or garnishment against Borrower with respect to aggregate claims in excess of $500,000.00 (after giving effect to any insurance available therefore) shall remain unpaid, unstayed on appeal, undischarged, unbonded or undismissed for a period of thirty (30) days; or

(k) the occurrence of any of the following events: (A) Borrower enters into any transaction of merger, consolidation or reorganization (unless Borrower is the surviving entity and, after giving effect to such event, is in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Loan Documents on a pro forma basis); (B) Borrower ceases to do business as a going concern, liquidates, or dissolves, or sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its assets or property; (C) Borrower becomes the subject of, or engages in, a leveraged buy-out that does not result in a change of ownership or control covered by clause (E) of this paragraph; (D) Borrower changes the form of organization of its business; or (E) there is any substantial change in the ownership or control of the membership interests of Borrower such that the holder(s) that own or control fifty percent (50%) or more of such membership interests as of the Closing Date no longer do so; or

(l) this Agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or shall cease to give Agent the rights and interests purported to be created hereunder, including, without limitation, the failure of the interests granted hereunder to constitute a registered international interest in the Collateral subject to the Cape Town Convention (other than as a result of any failure in filing or otherwise on the part of Agent or its agents); or

(m) a Default or an Event of Default (as such terms are defined therein) shall occur under any of the other Loan Documents.

# SECTION 5. Remedies.

5.1 Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents, Agent may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or of a creditor, including a security assignee, under the Cape Town Convention (including without limitation, the remedies contemplated by Article 13 of the Convention and/or Article IX of the Protocol) or under any other Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent, without demand or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon Borrower or any other Person (all and each of which demands and/or notices are hereby expressly waived), in Agent's sole discretion, may exercise any one or more of the following remedies: (i) proceed at law or in equity, to enforce specifically Borrower's performance or to recover damages; (ii) terminate the right of any third party to use, possess or control the Aircraft; (iii) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, enter the premises where the Aircraft is located and take immediate possession of and remove (or disable in place) the Aircraft (and/or any Engines, APU and/or Parts then unattached to the Aircraft) by self-help, summary proceedings or otherwise without liability if conducted in accordance with Applicable Law; (iv) use Borrower's premises for storage without liability, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct; (v) preserve the Airframe, Engines, APU and/or Parts, and their respective value (but without any obligation to do so), immobilize or keep idle the Airframe and/or any Engine, APU or Part, manage, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the Airframe and/or any

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)

EFTA00012259

EFTA00012260

Engine, APU or Part or any of the other Collateral, whether or not in Agent's possession, in one or more parcels, at public or private sale or sales, with no less than ten (10) working days' prior notice to Borrower of any proposed sale or lease of the Airframe or any Engine, which Borrower acknowledges as constituting "reasonable prior notice" for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention, at such prices as Agent may deem best; (vi) apply any deposit, other cash collateral, or collect and apply proceeds to reduce any amounts due to Agent and/or Lenders; (vii) terminate any Third Party Agreement, without regard as to the existence of any event of default thereunder and recover, or cause Borrower and any party to any Third Party Agreement and any Person taking by or through any of them to relinquish possession and return the Aircraft, including the Engines, APU and Parts, pursuant to this Section 5, and/or exercise any and all other remedies under any Third Party Agreements, or in Borrower's stead, to the extent provided for under, or otherwise available to Borrower in connection with any Third Party Agreement; (viii) collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof; (ix) demand and obtain from any court speedy relief pending final determination available at law (including, without limitation, possession, control, custody or immobilization of the Aircraft or preservation of the Aircraft or its fair market value); (x) procure the deregistration (whether by utilizing the IDERA or otherwise) and/or export and physical transfer of the Aircraft from the territory in which it is then situated; and (xi) exercise any and all other remedies allowed by Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the Cape Town Convention and the UCC. Agent or either Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in Borrower, which right or equity of redemption is hereby expressly released. Borrower further agrees, at Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral, make it available to Agent at such places as Agent shall reasonably select, whether at Borrower's premises or elsewhere. Agent shall deliver to each Lender its pro rata share of the net proceeds of any such realization (after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith) ("Net Proceeds") based on such Lender's pro rata share of the Obligations then outstanding first, to be applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such order and manner as Lenders may elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be disbursed to Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower waives all claims, damages and demands against Agent and each Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or other disposition of the Collateral, except any claims or damages related to or arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender and any claims to any excess Net Proceeds remaining after the application of any Net Proceeds in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Borrower agrees that Agent need not give more than ten (10) working days' notice (as contemplated under the Cape Town Convention) of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place and that such notice is reasonable notification of such matters. Borrower shall be liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay in full the Obligations.

5.2 Relief Pending Final Determination. Without limiting the generality of Agent's other remedies set forth in this Section 5, in the event Agent adduces evidence of an Event of Default by Borrower, Agent may, pending final determination of its claim, obtain from a court speedy (as defined in Article 20 of the Cape Town Convention) relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as Agent requests:

(a) preservation of the Aircraft and its value;
(b) possession, control or custody of the Aircraft;
(c) immobilization of the Aircraft;
(d) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the Aircraft and the income therefrom; and
(e) if at any time Borrower and Agent specifically agree, sale and application of proceeds therefrom.

In furtherance thereof, Agent and Borrower hereby agree to exclude the application of paragraph 4 of Article 20 of the Cape Town Convention. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall limit the availability to Agent of other forms of interim relief.

EFTA00012261

EFTA00012262

5.3 No Waiver: Cumulative Remedies. No right or remedy is exclusive. Borrower hereby acknowledges that none of the provisions of this Section 5, including any remedies set forth or referenced herein, is "manifestly unreasonable" for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention. Each may be used successively and cumulatively and in addition to any other right or remedy referred to above or otherwise available to Agent and/or Lenders at law or in equity, including, such rights and/or remedies as are provided for in the UCC and/or the Cape Town Convention, but in no event shall Agent and/or Lenders be entitled to recover any amount in excess of the maximum amount recoverable under Applicable Law with respect to any Event of Default. No express or implied waiver by Agent and/or Lenders of any Default or Event of Default hereunder shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Default or Event of Default. The failure or delay of Agent and/or Lenders in exercising any rights granted it hereunder upon the occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or reoccurrence of any such contingencies or similar contingencies, and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by Agent and/or Lenders shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided for or otherwise referred to herein. After the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the acceptance by Agent and/or Lenders of any installment of principal and/or interest or of any other sum owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall not constitute a waiver of such Default (unless such Default arose from the failure to pay such installment and such installment was paid in full) or Event of Default, regardless of Agent's and/or either Lender's knowledge or lack of knowledge thereof at the time of acceptance of any such payment and shall not constitute a reinstatement of this Agreement if Agent and/or either Lender has sent Borrower a notice of default, unless Agent shall have agreed in writing to reinstate this Agreement and waive the Default or Event of Default. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower waives any rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise that limit or modify any rights or remedies of Agent and/or Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Articles 11(2) and 13(2) of the Convention and Article IX(6) of the Protocol.

## SECTION 6. Miscellaneous.

6.1 Notices. All communications and notices provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (i) upon hand delivery, or (ii) upon delivery by an overnight delivery service, or (iii) three (3) Business Days after being deposited in the U.S. mail, return receipt requested, first class postage prepaid, and addressed to Agent at the address set forth above or to Borrower at its address set forth under its signature hereto or such other address as either party may hereafter designate by written notice to the other, or (iv) when sent by telecopy (with customary confirmation of receipt of such telecopy) on the Business Day when sent or upon the next Business Day if sent on other than a Business Day.

## 6.2 Expenses and Fees; Indemnity; Performance of Borrower's Obligations.

(a) Borrower shall pay to Agent and each Lender upon demand all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Agent or such Lender at any time in connection with (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the collection of the Obligations, (ii) the creation, preservation and protection of the Collateral and the perfection and first priority of Agent's security interest, security assignment and Lien thereon, including any discharges and subordinations required to maintain such first priority and to remove or discharge any Liens not constituting Permitted Liens, or (iii) Borrower's exercise of any right granted under, or any amendment or other modification to any of, the Loan Documents. Such fees, costs and expenses shall include, without limitation, appraisal and inspection fees, the fees and expenses of FAA Counsel and of Agent's and each Lender's counsel, consultants and brokers, UCC, FAA, International Registry and other applicable title, interest and Lien searches, and costs and expenses relating to recovery, repossession, storage, insurance, transportation, repair, refurbishment, advertising, sale and other disposition of the Aircraft. Borrower shall also pay all fees (including license, filing and registration fees), taxes, assessments and other charges of whatever kind or nature that may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery, recording or performance of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any modification thereof.

2394767

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT)
EFTA00012263

EFTA00012264

(b) Borrower hereby further agrees to pay, indemnify, and hold Agent and each Lender and their respective Affiliates and all of Agent's and each Lender's and such Affiliates' respective directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents, predecessors, attorneys-in-fact, lawyers, successors and assigns (Agent, each Lender, their respective Affiliates and all of such other parties and entities sometimes hereinafter collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless, on a net after-tax basis, from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, out-of-pocket costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever arising with respect to or in connection with the Loan Documents or the Collateral, including, without limitation, the ownership, lease, possession, use, sale or other disposition of the Aircraft and the other Collateral or the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (the foregoing being referred to as the "indemnified liabilities"), provided, that Borrower shall have no obligations thereunder with respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender, as applicable.

(c) If Borrower fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein or in the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, its obligations to keep the Aircraft free and clear of Liens, to comply with Applicable Standards or to obtain the requisite insurance coverages, Agent and/or either Lender shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to effect such performance or compliance, with such agreement. Any expenses of Agent and/or either Lender incurred in connection with effecting such performance or compliance, together with interest thereon at the highest default rate of interest provided for in the Loan Documents from the date incurred until reimbursed, shall be payable by Borrower to Agent and/or such Lender promptly on demand and until such payment shall constitute part of the Obligations secured hereby. Any such action shall not be a cure or waiver of any Default or Event of Default hereunder.

(d) Without waiving any other rights or remedies of Agent, due to the often time intensive nature of reviewing complex reorganizations, if Borrower requests Agent's consent to the corporate or other entity reorganization of Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower, Agent may require, at its option, a Two Thousand Dollar ($2,000.00) review fee; plus, Agent may, at Borrower's expense, retain outside counsel to aid in review of the reorganization documentation.

6.3 Entire Agreement; Modifications. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the matters contained herein and shall completely and fully supersede all other prior agreements (including any proposal letter, commitment letter, and/or term sheet), both written and oral, between Agent and/or either Lender and Borrower relating to the Obligations. None of Agent, either Lender nor Borrower shall hereafter have any rights under such prior agreements but shall look solely to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents for the definition and determination of all of their respective rights, liabilities and responsibilities relating to the Obligations. Neither this Agreement, nor any terms hereof, may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of a change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought.

6.4 Construction of this Agreement and Related Matters. All representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Borrower's obligations contained in Section 6.2 hereof shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. The headings of the Sections hereof are for convenience only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof. Time is of the essence in the payment and performance of all of Borrower's obligations under this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement that may be determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective in such jurisdiction to the extent thereof without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

EFTA00012266

6.5 Lender's Assignment. Each Lender, may at any time, with or without notice to Borrower, grant a security interest in, sell, assign or otherwise transfer (an "Assignment") all or any part of its interest in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all associated rights associated with or secured thereby and the related international interests) or any amount due or to become due hereunder or thereunder, and Borrower shall perform all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, to the extent so transferred, for the benefit of the beneficiary of such Assignment (such beneficiary, including any successors and assigns, an "Assignee"); provided that no such Assignment shall be to any Person engaged in the operation of a fractional aircraft ownership program. Borrower hereby waives any right to assert, and agrees not to assert, against any Assignee any abatement, reduction, defense, setoff, recoupment, claim or counterclaim that Borrower may have against Agent or such Lender, other than defenses arising from fraudulent acts on the part of Assignee. Upon the express assumption by such Assignee of such Lender's obligations hereunder, such Lender shall be relieved of any such assumed obligations. Borrower hereby consents to any such assignment, grant, sale or transfer, including, without limitation, for purposes of the Cape Town Convention. If so directed in writing, Borrower shall pay all amounts due or to become due to the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents and/or any related associated rights and international interests directly to Assignee or any other party designated in writing by such Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that such Lender's right to enter into an Assignment is essential to such Lender and, accordingly, waives any restrictions under Applicable Law with respect to an Assignment and any related remedies. Upon the request of such Lender or any Assignee, Borrower also agrees (a) to promptly execute and deliver to such Lender or to such Assignee an acknowledgment of assignment in form and substance satisfactory to the requesting party, an insurance certificate naming Assignee as additional insured and loss payee and otherwise evidencing the insurance coverages required hereby, a consent to the Assignment for International Registry purposes, as well as renew any authorization required by the International Registry in connection with such consent, such as renewing its transacting user entity status and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's or such Lender's judgment, and such other documents and assurances reasonably requested by Agent, such Lender or Assignee and make, or cause to be made, all registrations (including all assignments and subordinations) and all amendments, extensions and discharges with the International Registry reasonably requested by Agent, such Lender or Assignee (and give or obtain any necessary consent thereto, as well as renew any authorization required by the International Registry in connection therewith, including renewing its transacting user entity status and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's and/or such Lender's judgment), and (b) to comply with the reasonable requirements of any such Assignee in order to perfect such Assignee's Lien in the Airframe, Engines (including all associated rights associated therewith or secured thereby and the related international interests), proceeds and other Collateral.

6.6 Jurisdiction. Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in any way in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents may be instituted or brought in the courts of the State of New York or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, as Agent may elect or in any other state or Federal court as Agent shall deem appropriate, and by execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court, and to all proceedings in such courts. Borrower irrevocably consents to service of any summons and/or legal process by first class, certified United States air mail, postage prepaid, to Borrower at the address set forth below its signature hereto, such method of service to constitute, in every respect, sufficient and effective service of process in any such legal action or proceeding. Nothing in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents shall affect the right to service of process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of Agent and/or either Lender to bring actions, suits or proceedings in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Borrower further agrees that final judgment against it in any such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction, within or outside the United States of America, by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and the amount of the liability. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Agent and Borrower may bring a judicial proceeding against the Registrar of the International Registry in the Republic of Ireland, solely with respect to matters relating to the International Registry itself.

6.8 Governing Law; Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of both parties shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflict of laws principles of such state, except as to the effect of Title 14, Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law), including all matters of construction, validity, and performance. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, Agent, and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that Borrower may not assign or transfer its rights hereunder or any interest herein.

6.9 Jury Waiver. BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND FREELY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO, ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

6.10 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures; Other Electronic Transmissions. This Agreement and all of the other Loan Documents, and any notices to be given pursuant to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, may be executed and delivered by telecopier, facsimile or other electronic transmission (i.e., PDF format) all with the same force and effect as if the same was a fully executed and delivered original counterpart. The original counterparts of this Agreement and all Loan Documents shall be delivered by Borrower promptly after execution, and failure to so deliver, at Agent's option, shall be an Event of Default, but failure to deliver shall in no way limit or negate enforceability of any Loan Document.

# ANNEX A

## DEFINITIONS

CH1995086130-5.066497.0072

EFTA00012399

EFTA00012400

serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested each Airframe, Engine, and Part, or other relevant Mortgage Collateral, so as to the good operating condition as when originally mortgaged hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, in the case of each Aircraft, in such condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be maintained in respect of such Mortgage Collateral. The Grantor will comply with all material rules and regulations of the FAA. The Grantor agrees that the Airframes, Engines and Parts and any other Mortgage Collateral will not be maintained, used or operated: (A) in violation of any material law, rule, regulation or order (as defined below) of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration relating to any Mortgage Collateral issued by any such Governmental Authority, except for any violation which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (B) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance required by the terms of subsection 4.5 thereof, except in the case of a requisition for use by the United States of America, and then only if the Grantor obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the United States of America against the risks and in the amounts required by said subsection 4.5 covering such area, or as to which the Grantor has otherwise obtained the written consent of the Mortgagee; or (C) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered to the Mortgagee's satisfaction by war-risk insurance, or unless such Airframe, Engine, Parts or other Mortgage Collateral are operated or used under contract with the government of United States of America under which contract said government assumes liability for any other damage, loss, destruction or failure to return possession of such Airframe, Engine, Parts or Mortgage Collateral at the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to property of others or unless the Aircraft is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an isolated occurrence attributable to a hijacking, medical emergency, equipment malfunction, weather conditions, navigational error or other similar unforeseen circumstances and the Grantor is using its good faith efforts to remove the Aircraft from such area. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a "material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of Grantor's authority to operate as a Certified Air Carrier.

4.2 Liens.

purchase, ownership, mortgaging hereunder, lease, sublease, use, storage, maintenance, sale or other disposition of any Airframe, Engine or Part, or any rentals or other earnings payable therefor or arising therefrom or the income or other proceeds received with respect thereto, or (iii) this Mortgage; provided, however, that, nothing in this subsection 4.3 shall require the payment of any Tax unless proceedings shall have been commenced to foreclose any Lien which may have attached as security for such Tax, so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and that Grantor shall have set aside and maintained on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

4.4 Possession. The Grantor will not, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, except as permitted under the Credit and Security Agreement, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer, remove or relinquish possession or control of, or transfer any right, title or interest of the Grantor in, any Mortgage Collateral, including without limitation any Airframe, Engine or Part or install any Engine or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than an Airframe, or permit any Part to be installed on or attached to any airframe or engine other than to an Airframe or Engine.

4.6 Modification and Additions. The Grantor, at its expense, shall make such modifications in and additions to the Airframes and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the standards of the FAA or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction. In addition, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Grantor, at its expense, may from time to time make such modifications in and additions to any Airframe or Engine as it may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, provided that no such modification or addition shall diminish the value or utility of such Airframe or Engine or impair the airworthiness or operating condition thereof below the value, utility, airworthiness and condition thereof immediately prior to such modification or addition (assuming such Airframe or Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition required by the terms of this Mortgage immediately prior to such modification or addition) and any expenses incurred or related thereto are in accordance with the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement.

4.11 Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe on which such Engine was originally installed, the Grantor shall give the Mortgagee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, duly subject to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage, in substitution for the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, substitute another engine of the same manufacturer and model described on Schedule 1 attached hereto (or engine of the same manufacturer of an improved model and suitable for installation and use on an Airframe or such other engine acceptable to the Mortgagee) (herein called a “Replacement Engine”), free and clear of all Liens and having a value and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred assuming such Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by the terms of this Mortgage immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. At the time of such replacement, the Grantor, at its expense, shall (i) furnish the Mortgagee with evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the Mortgagee, of the Grantor’s title to the Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a supplement to this Mortgage describing the Replacement Engine to be duly executed and filed for recordation pursuant to the Act, (iii) furnish the Mortgagee with such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of subsection 4.5 hereof with respect to such Replacement Engine as the Mortgagee may reasonably request, and (iv) furnish the Mortgagee with such certificates and opinions of counsel as the Mortgagee may request in order to evidence the value, utility and operating condition of the Replacement Engine, the Grantor’s title to the Replacement Engine free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and the subjection of the Replacement Engine to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. Upon full compliance by the Grantor with the provisions of this subsection 4.11, the Mortgagee will deliver to the Grantor an instrument releasing the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred from the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. For all purposes of this Mortgage, each Replacement Engine shall, after being subjected to the lien and security interest hereof, be deemed an “Engine” as defined herein and shall be deemed part of the same Aircraft as was the Engine replaced thereby.

with the laws and regulations of the FAA and the requirements of the Cape Town Convention with respect to any International Interest of the Mortgagee with respect to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft, or the laws and regulations of any of the various states or countries in which the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft is or may fly over, operate in, or become located in or any other applicable law, including, without limitation, the execution, delivery and filing of UCC financing and continuation statements with respect to the security interests created hereby, registration of any International Interest of the Mortgagee with respect to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft with the International Registry, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to the Mortgagee, in such jurisdictions as the Mortgagee may reasonably request. The Grantor hereby authorizes the Mortgagee to file any such statements without the signature of the Grantor to the extent permitted by applicable law.

4.13 Sale of Aircraft. Without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, the Grantor shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Mortgage Collateral, including any Aircraft or enter into any conditional sale, finance lease or any other agreement or arrangement which has the same legal effect as a sale (regardless of whether Grantor retains title to such Aircraft), except as provided in the Credit and Security Agreement.

## SECTION 5
RECEIPT, DISTRIBUTION AND APPLICATION OF INCOME

5.1 Application of Proceeds and Amounts Realized On Mortgage Collateral. Whether or not an Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder and/or under the Credit and Security Agreement, all payments and proceeds related to and arising from the Mortgage Collateral shall be paid to the Mortgagee and applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement.

## SECTION 6
EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

6.1 Remedies. If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur, the Mortgagee may, without notice of any kind to the Grantor, except as otherwise provided herein and to the extent permitted by law, carry out or enforce the actions or remedies provided in this Section 6 or elsewhere in this Mortgage, any applicable rights and remedies specified under the Cape Town Convention, and any rights and remedies otherwise available to a secured party under the UCC and/or the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect at the time in any applicable jurisdiction; provided, however, that such actions and remedies shall be in addition to, and not be deemed to limit, the remedies provided in any Security Document.

6.2 Possession of Mortgage Collateral. If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may, without notice, take possession of all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft and may exclude the Grantor, and all persons claiming under the Grantor, wholly or partly therefrom. In addition, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to exercise all of their respective rights and remedies as set forth in this Mortgage, under the Loan Documents, and at law with respect to the Mortgage Collateral. At the request of the Mortgagee, the Grantor shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Mortgagee or to whomsoever the Mortgagee shall designate, at such time or times and place

or places as the Mortgagee may reasonably specify, and fly or cause to be flown to such airport or airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may reasonably specify, without risk or expense to the Mortgagee, all or any part of the Aircraft specified by the Mortgagee. In addition, the Grantor will provide, without cost or expense to the Mortgagee, storage facilities for the Mortgage Collateral, including any Aircraft. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver any Mortgage Collateral or any part thereof after demand by the Mortgagee, the Mortgagee may, without being responsible for loss or damage, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Mortgagee, (i) obtain an order from any court having jurisdiction conferring on the Mortgagee the right to immediate possession or requiring the Grantor to deliver immediate possession of all or part of such Aircraft to the Mortgagee, to the entry of which the Grantor hereby specifically consents, or (ii) with or, to the fullest extent provided by law, without such judgment, pursue all or any part of such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft wherever they may be found and enter any of the premises of or leased by the Grantor where such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft may be and search for such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft and take possession of and remove the same. The Grantor agrees to pay to the Mortgagee, upon demand, all expenses incurred in taking any such action; and all such expenses shall constitute Obligations and, until paid, be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage and the Security Documents. Upon every such taking of possession, the Mortgagee may, from time to time, make all such reasonable expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements to and of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft as it may deem proper.

## 6.3 Sale and Suits for Enforcement.

(a) If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee, with or without taking possession of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft, may:

(i) to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, sell at one or more sales, all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral, at public or private sale, at such place or places and at such time or times and upon such terms, including terms of credit (which may include the retention of title by the Mortgagee to the property so sold), as the Mortgagee may determine, whether or not the Mortgage Collateral shall be at the place of sale; and

(ii) proceed to protect and enforce its rights under this Mortgage by suit, whether for specific performance of any covenant herein contained or in aid of the exercise of any power herein granted or for the foreclosure of this Mortgage and the sale of the Mortgage Collateral under the judgment or decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction or for the enforcement of any other right.

(b) At any public sale of any Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft or any part thereof by the Mortgagee pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above, the Mortgagee may consider and accept bids requiring the extension of credit to the bidder and may determine the highest bidder at such sale, whether or not the bid of such bidder shall be solely for cash or shall require the extension of credit.

CH199 5086130-5.066497.0072

EFTA00012409

EFTA00012410

(c) The Mortgagee, to the extent permitted by law, may from time to time adjourn any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above by announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or for any adjournment thereof; and without further notice or publication, such sale be made at the time and place to which the same shall have been so adjourned.

(d) Upon the completion of any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above, full title and right of possession to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft so sold shall (subject to any retention of title by the Mortgagee as part of the terms of such sale) pass to the accepted purchaser forthwith upon the completion of such sale, and the Grantor shall deliver, in accordance with the instructions of the Mortgagee (including flying any Aircraft or causing the same to be flown to such airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may specify), such Mortgage Collateral so sold. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver such Mortgage Collateral, the Mortgagee shall have all of the rights granted by subsection 6.2 thereof. The Mortgagee is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the Grantor, in its name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances of any Mortgage Collateral so sold. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Mortgagee or by any purchaser, the Grantor shall confine any such sale or conveyance by executing and delivering all proper instruments of conveyance or releases as may be designated in any such request.

6.4 Waiver of Appraisement, etc. The Grantor agrees, to the fullest extent that it lawfully may, that it will not (and hereby irrevocably waives its right to) at any time plead, or claim the benefit or advantage of, any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this Mortgage or the absolute sale of the Mortgage Collateral.

6.5 Remedies Cumulative. No remedy herein conferred upon the Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy herein conferred or now or hereafter existing in law.

6.6 Application of Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral pursuant to this Mortgage and all other sums realized or held by the Mortgagee under this Mortgage or any proceedings hereunder shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement.

6.7 Delay or Omission; Possession of Loan Certificates.

(a) No delay or omission of the Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy arising upon the happening of any Default or Event of Default shall impair any right or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every right and remedy given to the Mortgagee by this Section 6, the Loan Documents or by applicable law may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee.

(b) All rights of action under this Mortgage may be enforced by the Mortgagee without the possession of the Notes or any other instrument or document evidencing any obligation or the production thereof in any proceeding.

EFTA00012412

6.8 Mortgagee's Right to Perform for the Grantor. From and after the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, if the Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Mortgagee may perform or comply with such agreement, and the amount of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the performance or compliance with such agreement (together with interest thereon at the Default Rate) shall be payable by the Grantor to the Mortgagee on demand and shall be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage.

6.9 Deregistration. If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may, without being responsible for loss or damage, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Mortgagee, procure the deregistration of the registration of the Aircraft and export the Aircraft to a jurisdiction of the Mortgagee's choice pursuant to the IDERA and as authorized by the Cape Town Convention. The Grantor agrees to pay to the Mortgagee, upon demand, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in taking any such action, including reasonable attorney fees; and all such expenses and fees shall constitute Obligations and, until paid, be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. At the request of the Mortgagee, the Grantor will execute and deliver an IDERA to the Mortgagee to be filed with the FAA.

6.10 Speedy Relief Remedies. If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may, pending final determination of its claim in any court proceeding, obtain speedy relief in the form of an order providing for (i) preservation of the Mortgage Collateral and its value; (ii) possession, control or custody of the Mortgage Collateral; (iii) immobilization of the Mortgage Collateral; (iv) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) of this subsection 6.10, management of the Mortgage Collateral and the income therefrom, and (v) sale and application of proceeds therefrom.

# SECTION 7 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

7.1 Amendments, etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Mortgage, nor consent to any departure by the Grantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Mortgagee and the Grantor, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested each Airframe, Engine, and Part, or other relevant Mortgage Collateral, so as to the good operating condition as when originally mortgaged hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, in the case of each Aircraft, in such condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be maintained in respect of such Mortgage Collateral. The Grantor will comply with all material rules and regulations of the FAA. The Grantor agrees that the Airframes, Engines and Parts and any other Mortgage Collateral will not be maintained, used or operated: (A) in violation of any material law, rule, regulation or order (as defined below) of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration relating to any Mortgage Collateral issued by any such Governmental Authority, except for any violation which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (B) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance required by the terms of subsection 4.5 thereof, except in the case of a requisition for use by the United States of America, and then only if the Grantor obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the United States of America against the risks and in the amounts required by said subsection 4.5 covering such area, or as to which the Grantor has otherwise obtained the written consent of the Mortgagee; or (C) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered to the Mortgagee's satisfaction by war-risk insurance, or unless such Airframe, Engine, Parts or other Mortgage Collateral are operated or used under contract with the government of United States of America under which contract said government assumes liability for any other damage, loss, destruction or failure to return possession of such Airframe, Engine, Parts or Mortgage Collateral at the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to property of others or unless the Aircraft is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an isolated occurrence attributable to a hijacking, medical emergency, equipment malfunction, weather conditions, navigational error or other similar unforeseen circumstances and the Grantor is using its good faith efforts to remove the Aircraft from such area. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a "material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of Grantor's authority to operate as a Certified Air Carrier.

the Lien of this Mortgage in favor of the Mortgagee; (ii) at all times cause to be maintained, serviced, repaired, overhauled and tested each Airframe, Engine, and Part, or other relevant Mortgage Collateral, so as to the good operating condition as when originally mortgaged hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, in the case of each Aircraft, in such condition as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be maintained in respect of such Mortgaged Collateral.

For purposes of this Section 4.1, a "material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of Grantor's authority to operate as a Certified Air Carrier.

NJ 226,294,392v7
EFTA00012653

EFTA00012654

002025

as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be maintained in respect of such Mortgaged Collateral. The Grantor will comply with all material rules and regulations of the FAA. The Grantor agrees that the Airframes, Engines and Parts and any other Mortgage Collateral will not be maintained, used or operated: (A) in violation of any material law or any rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration relating to any Mortgage Collateral issued by any such Governmental Authority, except for any violation which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (B) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance required by the terms of subsection 4.5 hereof, except in the case of a requisition for use by the United States of America, and then only if the Grantor obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the United States of America against the risks and in the amounts required by said subsection 4.5 covering such area, or as to which the Grantor has otherwise obtained the written consent of the Mortgagee; or (C) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered to the Mortgagee's satisfaction by war-risk insurance, or unless such Airframe, Engine, Parts or other Mortgage Collateral are operated or used under contract with the Government of United States of America under which contract said Government assumes liability for any the damage, loss, destruction or failure to return possession of such Airframe, Engine, Parts or Mortgage Collateral at the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to property of others or unless the Aircraft is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an isolated occurrence attributable to a hijacking, medical emergency, equipment malfunction, weather conditions, navigational error or other similar unforeseen circumstances and the Grantor is using its good faith efforts to remove the Aircraft from such area. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a "material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of Grantor's authority to operate as a Certified Air Carrier.

4.2 Liens. The Grantor will not create or suffer to exist any Lien, International Interests or Prospective International Interest upon or with respect to any of the Mortgage Collateral, except for Permitted Liens and any other Liens permitted by the terms thereof and of the Loan and Security Agreement.

4.3 Taxes. The Grantor will pay, and hereby indemnifies the Mortgagee and each Lender from and against, any and all fees and taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or withholdings, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon (any of the foregoing being here called a "Tax") which may from time to time be imposed on or asserted against the Mortgagee or any Airframe, Engine or Part or other Mortgage Collateral or any interest therein by any Federal, state or local government or other taxing authority in the United States or by any foreign government or subdivision thereof or by any foreign taxing authority upon or with respect to: (i) any Airframe, Engine or Part, or any interest therein, (ii) the manufacture, purchase, ownership, mortgaging hereunder, lease, sublease, use, storage, maintenance, sale or other disposition of any Airframe, Engine or Part, or any rentals or other earnings payable therefor or arising therefrom or the income or other proceeds received with respect thereto, or

NJ 226,294,392v7

EFTA00012655

EFTA00012656

(iii) this Mortgage; provided, however, that, nothing in this subsection 4.3 shall require the payment of any Tax unless proceedings shall have been commenced to foreclose any Lien which may have attached as security for such Tax, so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and that Grantor shall have set aside and maintain on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto.

4.4 Possession. The Grantor will not, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, except as permitted under the Loan and Security Agreement, lease or otherwise in any manner deliver, transfer, remove or relinquish possession or control of, or transfer any right, title or interest of the Grantor in, any Mortgage Collateral, including without limitation any Airframe, Engine or Part or install any Engine or permit any Engine to be installed, on any airframe other than an Airframe, or permit any Part to be installed on or attached to any airframe or engine other than to an Airframe or Engine.

4.5 Insurance.

(a) The Grantor at its own expense shall carry insurance with respect to the Mortgage Collateral as required pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Loan and Security Agreement, together with such endorsements in favor of the Mortgagee (or Lender) as are required under the Loan and Security Agreement.

4.6 Modification and Additions. The Grantor, at its expense, shall make such modifications in and additions to the Airframes and the Engines as may be required from time to time to meet the standards of the FAA or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.

### 4.10 Citizenship.
The Grantor shall at all times be a "Citizen of the United States" as defined in 49 U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(15)(c).

### 4.11 Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe on which such Engine was originally installed, the Grantor shall give the Mortgagee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, duly subject to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage, in substitution for the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, substitute another General Electric CF6-50C2 engine (or engine of the same manufacturer of an improved model and suitable for installation and use on an Airframe or such other engine acceptable to the Mortgagee) (herein called a "Replacement Engine"), free and clear of all Liens and having a value and utility at least equal to, and being in as good operating condition as, the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred assuming such Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition and repair required by the terms of this Mortgage immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. At the time of such replacement, the Grantor, at its expense, shall (i) furnish the Mortgagee with evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the Mortgagee, of the Grantor's title to the Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a supplement to this Mortgage describing the Replacement Engine to be duly executed and filed for recordation pursuant to the Act, (iii) furnish the Mortgagee with such evidence of compliance with the insurance provisions of subsection 4.5 hereof with respect to such Replacement Engine as the Mortgagee may reasonably request, and (iv) furnish the Mortgagee with such certificates and opinions of counsel as the Mortgagee may request in order to evidence the value, utility and operating condition of the Replacement Engine, the Grantor's title to the Replacement Engine free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and the subjection of the Replacement Engine to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. Upon full compliance by the Grantor with the provisions of this subsection 4.11, the Mortgagee will deliver to the Grantor an instrument releasing the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred from the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. For all purposes of this Mortgage, each Replacement Engine shall, after being subjected to the lien and security interest hereof, be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein and shall be deemed part of the same Aircraft as was the Engine replaced thereby.

### 4.12 Further Assurances.
The Grantor at its expense will promptly and duly execute and deliver such documents and assurances and take such action as may be necessary, or as the Mortgagee may from time to time request, in order to more effectively carry out the intent and purpose of this Mortgage, to establish, protect and perfect the rights, remedies, liens and security interests created or intended to be created in favor of the Mortgagee hereunder and to comply with the laws and regulations of the FAA and the requirements of the Cape Town Treaty with respect any International Interest of the Mortgagee with respect to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft, or the laws and regulations of any of the various states or countries in which the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft is or may fly over, operate in, or become

NJ 226,294,392v7

EFTA00012659

EFTA00012660

located in or any other applicable law, including, without limitation, the execution, delivery and filing of UCC financing and continuation statements with respect to the security interests created hereby, registration of any International Interest of the Mortgagee with respect to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft with the International Registry, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to the Mortgagee, in such jurisdictions as the Mortgagee may reasonably request. The Grantor hereby authorizes the Mortgagee to file any such statements without the signature of the Grantor to the extent permitted by applicable law.

4.13 Sale of Aircraft. Without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee, the Grantor shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Mortgage Collateral, including any Aircraft or enter into any conditional sale, finance lease or any other agreement or arrangement which has the same legal effect as a sale (regardless of whether Grantor retains title to such Aircraft), except as provided in the Loan and Security Agreement.

## SECTION 5
RECEIPT, DISTRIBUTION AND APPLICATION OF INCOME

5.1 Application of Proceeds and Amounts Realized On Mortgage Collateral. Whether or not an Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder and/or the Loan and Security Agreement, all payments and proceeds related to and arising from the Mortgage Collateral shall be paid to the Mortgagee and applied in accordance with the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement.

## SECTION 6
EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

6.1 Remedies. If an Event of Default under the Loan and Security Agreement shall occur, the Mortgagee may, without notice of any kind to the Grantor, except as otherwise provided herein and to the extent permitted by law, carry out or enforce the actions or remedies provided in this Section 6 or elsewhere in this Mortgage, any applicable rights and remedies specified under the Cape Town Convention, and any rights and remedies otherwise available to a secured party under the UCC and/or the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect at the time in my applicable jurisdiction; provided, however, that such actions and remedies shall be in addition to, and not be deemed to limit, the remedies provided in any Security Document.

6.2 Possession of Mortgage Collateral. If an Event of Default under the Loan and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may, without notice take possession of all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft and may exclude the Grantor, and all persons claiming under the Grantor, wholly or partly therefrom. In addition, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to exercise all of their respective rights and remedies as set forth in this Mortgage, under the Loan Documents, and at law with respect to the Mortgage Collateral. At the request of the Mortgagee, the Grantor shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Mortgagee or to whomsoever the Mortgagee shall designate, at such time or times and place or places as the Mortgagee may reasonably specify, and fly or cause to be flown to such airport or airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may reasonably specify, without risk or expense to the Mortgagee, all or any part of the Aircraft specified by the Mortgagee. In addition, the Grantor will provide, without cost or expense to the Mortgagee, storage facilities

NJ 226,294,392v7
EFTA00012661

EFTA00012662

for the Mortgage Collateral, including any Aircraft. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver any Mortgage Collateral or any part thereof after demand by the Mortgagee, the Mortgagee may, without being responsible for loss or damage, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Mortgagee, (i) obtain an order from any court having jurisdiction conferring on the Mortgagee the right to immediate possession or requiring the Grantor to deliver immediate possession of all or part of such Aircraft to the Mortgagee, to the entry of which the Grantor specifically consents, or (ii) with or, to the fullest extent provided by law, without such judgment, pursue all or any part of such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft wherever they may be found and enter any of the premises of or leased by the Grantor where such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft may be and search for such Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft and take possession of and remove the same. The Grantor agrees to pay to the Mortgagee, upon demand, all expenses incurred in taking any such action; and all such expenses shall constitute Obligations and, until paid, be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage and Security Documents. Upon every such taking of possession, the Mortgagee may, from time to time, make all such reasonable expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements to and of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft as it may deem proper.

## 6.3 Sale and Suits for Enforcement.

(a) If an Event of Default under the Loan and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee, with or without taking possession of the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft, may

(i) to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, sell at one or more sales, all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral, at public or private sale, at such place or places and at such time or times and upon such terms, including terms of credit (which may include the retention of title by the Mortgagee to the property so sold), as the Mortgagee may determine, whether or not the Mortgage Collateral shall be at the place of sale; and

(ii) proceed to protect and enforce its rights under this Mortgage by suit, whether for specific performance of any covenant herein contained or in aid of the exercise of any power herein granted or for the foreclosure of this Mortgage and the sale of the Mortgage Collateral under the judgment or decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction or for the enforcement of any other right.

(b) At any public sale of an Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft or any part thereof by the Mortgagee pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above, the Mortgagee may consider and accept bids requiring the extension of credit to the bidder and may determine the highest bidder at such sale, whether or not the bid of such bidder shall be solely for cash or shall require the extension of credit.

(c) The Mortgagee, to the extent permitted by law, may from time to time adjourn any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above by announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or for any adjournment thereof; and without further notice or publication, such sale be made at the time and place to which the same shall have been so adjourned.

NJ 226,294,392v7

EFTA00012663

EFTA00012664

(d) Upon the completion of any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above, full title and right of possession to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft so sold shall (subject to any retention of title by the Mortgagee as part of the terms of such sale) pass to the accepted purchaser forthwith upon the completion of such sale, and the Grantor shall deliver, in accordance with the instructions of the Mortgagee (including flying any Aircraft or causing the same to be flown to such airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may specify), such Mortgage Collateral so sold. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver such Mortgage Collateral, the Mortgagee shall have all of the rights granted by subsection 6.2 thereof. The Mortgagee is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the Grantor, in its name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances of any Mortgage Collateral so sold. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Mortgagee or by any purchaser, the Grantor shall confine any such sale or conveyance by executing and delivering all proper instruments of conveyance or releases as may be designated in any such request.

6.4 Waiver of Appraisement, etc. The Grantor agrees, to the fullest extent that it lawfully may, that it will not (and hereby irrevocably waives its right to) at any time plead, or claim the benefit or advantage of, any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this Mortgage or the absolute sale of the Mortgage Collateral.

6.5 Remedies Cumulative. No remedy herein conferred upon the Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy herein conferred or now or hereafter existing in law.

6.6 Application of Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral pursuant to this Mortgage and all other sums realized or held by the Mortgagee under this Mortgage or any proceedings hereunder shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement.

6.7 Delay or Omission; Possession of Loan Certificates.

(a) No delay or omission of the Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy arising upon the happening of any Default or Event of Default shall impair any right or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every right and remedy given to the Mortgagee by this Section 6, the Loan Documents, or by applicable law may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee.

(b) All rights of action under this Mortgage may be enforced by the Mortgagee without the possession of the Notes or any other instrument or document evidencing any obligation or the production thereof in any proceeding.

6.8 Mortgagee's Right to Perform for the Grantor. From and after the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, if the Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Mortgagee may perform or comply with such agreement, and the amount of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the

NJ 226,294,392v7

EFTA00012665

EFTA00012666

performance of or compliance with such agreement (together with interest thereon at the Default Rate) shall be payable by the Grantor to the Mortgagee on demand and shall be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage.

6.9 Deregistration. If an Event of Default under the Loan and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may without being responsible for loss or damage, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Mortgagee procure the deregistration of the registration of the Aircraft and export the Aircraft to a jurisdiction of the Mortgagee's choice pursuant to the Irrevocable De-Registration and Export Request Authorization ("IDERA") and as authorized by the Cape Town Convention. The Grantor agrees to pay to the Mortgagee, upon demand, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in taking any such action; and all such expenses shall constitute Obligations and, until paid, be secured by the lien and security interest of this Mortgage. At the request of the Mortgagee, the Grantor will execute and deliver an IDERA to the Mortgagee to be filed with the FAA.

6.10 Speedy Relief Remedies. If an Event of Default under the Loan and Security Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the Mortgagee may pending final determination of its claim in any court proceeding, obtain speedy relief in the form of an order providing for (i) preservation of the Mortgage Collateral and its value; (ii) possession, control or custody of the Mortgage Collateral; (iii) immobilization of the Mortgage Collateral; (iv) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii), management of the Mortgage Collateral and the income therefrom; and (v) sale and application of proceeds therefrom.

B. All contracts and agreements of every kind (oral and written), contract rights, rights to receive payments, goods or services of every kind, general intangibles, chattel paper and accounts, whether now existing or owned or hereafter arising or acquired, governing, relating to or arising out of my right, title or interest in the Aircraft, including, without limitation, the Raytheon Travel Air Company (hereinafter referred to as "RTA") agreements described as follows: Master Interchange Agreement, Joint Ownership Agreement, Management Agreement, and Aircraft Interest Purchase Agreement, including any amendments thereto (collectively the "Governing Documents").

2. Governing Documents. Debtor warrants that on the date of this Security Agreement, the Governing Documents are in full force and effect and current in all respects, that no default or event or condition which with the passage of time would become a default thereunder exists and that no party to any of the Governing Documents has any right to offset or defense under or with respect to any of the Governing Documents. Except as otherwise provided in this Security Agreement, Debtor shall fully perform all Debtor's obligations under the Governing Documents. Debtor authorizes and directs RTA and its successors, assigns and affiliates to provide RACC, as the secured party, with such information as RACC may request regarding the Governing Documents, any amendments thereto or modifications thereof, and any other contract or agreement governing, relating to or arising out of Debtor's right, title or interest in the Collateral, including, without limitation information regarding Debtor's payments and performance thereunder.

The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code.

3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102.

4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions:

5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals.

5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation shall at all times be on Debtor.

7. Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds

therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records of the Collateral and any such proceeds.

8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the Collateral.

9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable.

In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee.

Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral.

10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future.

11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the Promissory Note.

13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of address from that shown in this Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such change.

14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST.

2. Governing Documents.

The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code.

3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102.

4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions:

5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals.

5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation shall at all times be on Debtor.

7. Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds

therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records of the Collateral and any such proceeds.

8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the Collateral.

9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable.

In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee.

Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral.

10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future.

11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the Promissory Note.

13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of address from that shown in this Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such change.

14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ENTERED INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT

take any action to collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code.

3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102.

4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions:

5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals.

5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly certified and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation shall at all times be on Debtor.

7. Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and

pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records of the Collateral and any such proceeds.

8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the Collateral.

9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable.

In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee.

Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral.

10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future.

11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the Promissory Note.

take any action to collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code.

3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102.

4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable.

5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions:

5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals.

5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical boundaries of the United States.

5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturer's operating and maintenance manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the maintenance and operation of the Collateral.

6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation shall at all times be on Debtor.

7. Debtor's Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and

EFTA00013118

pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records of the Collateral and any such proceeds.

8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of the Collateral.

9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable.

In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee.

Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral.

10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future.

11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied.

12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the Promissory Note.

13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of address from that shown in this Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such change.

14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM.

THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN EITHER THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS AT WICHITA, KANSAS, OR IN THE EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF SEDGWICK COUNTY, KANSAS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER COURTS AND TRIBUNALS.

THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT AND AGREE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

15. Enforceability. The unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

16. Binding Agreement. All obligations of Debtor hereunder shall bind the heirs, agents and attorneys-in-fact, successors and assigns of Debtor.

There are no verbal understandings, agreements, representations or warranties not expressly set forth herein.
