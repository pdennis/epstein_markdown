Billionaire pleads to Fla. prostitution charge

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- New York billionaire Jeffrey Epstein has pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from underage girls in South Florida.

Circuit Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo sentenced the 55-year-old money manager Monday to 18 months in the Palm Beach County jail, followed by a year of house arrest. He will also be designated a sex offender.

Epstein was arrested two years ago. Authorities allege he paid several girls under the age of 18 $200 to $300 each in return for naked massages at his Palm Beach home that sometimes became sexual.

He also faces state and federal lawsuits filed by several women over similar allegations.
