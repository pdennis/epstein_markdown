Yeah, I'm at Sanibel Island right now. Just finished watching the 4th parade. I do believe there was a possibly in the message pads but she was never fully identified. There were only a couple of other names in the message pads that we didn't get Id'd, including and (girls I believe brought). I have a feeling we'll be hearing about many other victims since his conviction.

Hope you have a Happy 4th of July!
