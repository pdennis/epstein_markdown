Jay,

Please confirm that this will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence. If it does, I have to reconsider postponement of the guilty plea date. Thanks,

Alex - I wanted to thank you for making the time for breakfast Friday. It was great to catch up.

Following up on our conversation about the date for Mr. Epstein's plea, where you said that you didn't want to dictate a schedule to the state, as we discussed I have a case where I represent an individual who is now the lead witness for the government, and openings are set for next week. Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's attorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will plan to proceed on one that date. Please confirm that this is ok.

Thanks, Jay
