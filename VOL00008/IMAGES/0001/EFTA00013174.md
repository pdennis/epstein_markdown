I take that back. In one of the initial emails FBI sent over, they included a draft agenda. We have since had discussions indicating we don't believe significant aspects of that draft agenda are appropriate, so what they sent over is not current. But this is what they sent:

## AGENDA

Welcome &amp; Introductions by Executive Management

Investigative team: Explanation of dismissal process after Epstein's suicide; explanation of the judicial process; importance of interviewing all pertinent victims; all victims entitled to services but not all may be pertinent to the ongoing investigation

FBI NYO: Safety concerns; media interaction

VSD: Victim rights and services; State Crime Compensation/EVAF

Open Q&amp;A and Closing

Didn't we get a rough outline from FBI of what they want to do at these two victim sessions? I can't seem to find. If you have, can you forward to [REDACTED]?
