Well, ______, epstein's pricey lawyers may have cost him $200 million. I reviewed the docket sheets for the 4 pending federal suits (they are all jeff herman suits) and judge marra has issued orders to show cause why default judgments shouldn't be entered for all 4. Herman asked for $50 million in each one. Apparently epstein tried to avoid service and ignored the deadline when the complaints were mailed to him (thinking that was ineffective service). All I can say is, so much money, so little skill.
