To the extent that we do want to say anything, I think (based upon earlier conversations with Alex) that our Office’s position was that this started as a state case and Alex wanted it to stay a state case, but to provide for minimum protections for the victims, both in terms of jail time and compensation – in other words, this was a floor, not a ceiling. My personal opinion was that Alex wanted Barry Krischer to save face, but Alex never said that openly to me.

What are we going to say, if anything, tomorrow when contacted about this. I’m sure we will get a bunch of calls. Are we directing everything to [redacted] I presume?
