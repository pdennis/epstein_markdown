While our preference is to minimize the invasion of [redacted] privacy, there is unlikely to be anything in those files that will be of concern to you. Obviously, the disclosures to the Fund were made under assurances of confidentiality.

Jack,

Attached is a motion that Maxwell's has counsel filed seeking to subpoena information from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund, including information about [redacted]. We intend to file a motion to quash the subpoena later this week. Happy to have a call if you would like to discuss or have any questions.

Thanks,
