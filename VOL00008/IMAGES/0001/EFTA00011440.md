Distraught!

You probably wouldn't know but I lost my valet on Thursday. He died in his sleep. He had been with me since I was 2. I am a little off balance as not only has my office been restructured, I have left the RN and now my whole life is in turmoil as I have no one to look after me. He was a real rock and almost a part of the family.

If you have any good ideas as to how to get my mind back on track I'd be grateful for advice.

See you real soon... I hope if you are coming over.

A xxx

So sorry to disappoint you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends. Will let you know about some church meetings on those dates
