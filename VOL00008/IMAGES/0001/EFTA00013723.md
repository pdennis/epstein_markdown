Hi all – I know that it sounds like I wrote this (especially the part about “Epstein’s effort to buy his way out of prosecution”), but it actually was written by the editor of the Palm Beach Post.

On another note, I hope to have the final indictment package to [REDACTED] by Thursday or Friday at the latest.

Enjoy!
