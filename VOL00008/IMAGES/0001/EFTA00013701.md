Hi [redacted] and [redacted]: Here is an article from today’s Palm Beach Post. I especially like the part about how the “feds were overreaching the whole time.”

Do you want to do a conference call some time this morning? I have to leave for a sentencing at 12:30 and will be back in the office at around 3:00.

Thank you.
