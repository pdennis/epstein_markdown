Subject: Epstein contact

Dear Jack: I have received your letter and am considering it now. One of the questions I had asked you last week was whether you are the person whom attorneys for the victims should contact if they decide to file any claim. Are you the person? And, if so, what, if any, contact information would you like me to provide?

Thank you.
