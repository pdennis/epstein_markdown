# 1 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

## 1.1 GENERAL

This STC will include installations and/or updates to equipment to allow for Automatic dependent surveillance –broadcast Out (ADS-B Out). ADS-B periodically broadcasts information about each aircraft, such as identification, current position, altitude, and velocity, through an onboard transmitter. The equipment list in Table 2 below details the equipment required for this installation.

The TDR-94/94D Transponder(s) will be upgraded to part number 622-9352-502 (94) or 622-9210-502 (94D), if not previously installed. The TDR-94/94D Transponder is an all solid-state, crystal-controlled receiver/transmitter.

The transponder(s) will get the GPS information from either a newly installed Freeflight GPS1203C GPS receiver and dedicated GPS antenna; or, a GPS-4000S GPS receiver. Depending on the aircraft configuration, the GPS-4000/A/S may be previously installed. If the previously installed GPS-4000/A/S is not a part number 822-2189-004/005/006/007/010/011/100 it will have to be upgraded to one of these part numbers. (Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable GPS installation based on aircraft model)

Wiring is added dependent on the installed or replaced GPS receiver(s), Transponder(s), and annunciator installed. (Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable installations based on aircraft model and subsequent Wire Routing drawing 584-00-0005). See section 6.1.9 for details on inspection.

An optional ADS-B Out annunciator can be installed to alert the pilot that the ADS-B function of the active transponder is not properly functioning. The ADS-B Out annunciator is required for all standalone GPS installations. Standalone means the GPS only provides data to the transponders. All 1203C installations and 4000S installations that only connect to the transponders are standalone. It can be installed as an option for installations where the 4000S is used for both ADS-B and FMS navigation. ((Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable ADS-B Out Annunciator installation based on aircraft model)

## 2.4 Eddy Current Inspection

For eddy current inspection requirements and procedures, refer to the referenced documents in the table below for the different aircraft types.

The following documents describe the various procedures and requirements for HF eddy current inspection including personnel, instrumentation, equipment setup and standardization, probes, special tools and equipment eddy current standards, and eddy current test procedures required by the Cessna Aircraft Company.

The defects identified by this method are incipient fatigue or corrosion stress cracks in bores, machining radii, shoulders and countersunk holes, and in the actual skin. The direction of propagation defects are perpendicular to in-flight stresses in the case of fatigue stress cracks, or perpendicular to internal stresses for stress corrosion cracks. This method also detects minor corrosion-induced surface damage.

# 6 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

## 6.1 Scheduled Inspections and Maintenance Checks

This section of the document contains information regarding Time Limits – Inspection and Maintenance Checks, Overhaul and Replacement Items and Inspection Requirements.

### 6.1.1 Time Limits – Inspection and Maintenance Checks

**Note:**

Recommended inspection/maintenance intervals do not guarantee that the item will function properly between inspection/maintenance checks. The inspection intervals are based on average usage and environmental conditions. Aircraft operated under extreme conditions, (extreme hot, extreme cold, high humidity, salty air, etc.) may require more frequent maintenance than the intervals specified in this document. The aircraft operator may perform more frequent inspection/maintenance checks based on his usage.

### 6.1.2 Visual Inspections

The equipment necessary for conducting a visual inspection usually consists of a strong flashlight, a mirror with a ball joint, and a 2.5x – 4x magnifying glasses. A 10x magnifying glass is recommended for positive identification of suspected cracks.

### 6.1.3 Corrosion Treatment

Before attempting a close, visual inspection of any selected part or structural area, it should be checked for signs of corrosion. Any corrosion found should be tested to discover its extent and severity. Heavy or severe corrosion requires immediate corrective action. If mild corrosion is present, it should be carefully, but completely, removed before continuing with preparations for the visual inspection.

### 6.1.4 Structural Failure Determination.

The first step in a visual inspection should be an examination of the area for deformed or missing fasteners. These should be identified for subsequent replacement. A close examination for cracks in the surfaces of structural members should then be made with the aid of a flashlight. The majorities of cracks start at, and progress from, points of concentrated stress such as sharp corner cutouts and fastener holes. Cracks may also occur in sheet metal bend radii and similar places that were subjected to severe forming operations during manufacture.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS

## 6.1.5 Cleaning of Structural Parts

All parts of areas from which mild corrosion has been removed should be thoroughly cleaned using an approved solvent. (Metal conditioner should not be applied at this time as it may interfere with subsequent dye penetrant inspection.)

## 6.1.6 Cleaning Other Areas

All other areas to be inspected should also be cleaned of any deposits that might hinder the discovery of existing surface flaws. The protective finish need not be removed. The cleaning should be performed using any approved solvent. For cleaning high heat-treat steel parts, or areas in which a high heat steel part is installed, use only the approved solvents.

## 6.1.7 Crack Detection Technique

When looking for surface cracks, the inspector should point his flashlight towards himself and hold it at an angle of 5° - 45° to the surface. (See Figure 6) The extent of the crack may be traced by directing the beam at right angles to the crack. Never direct the light beam at such an angle that the reflected beam shines directly into the eyes. The proper procedure is to keep the eyes above the reflected beam.

![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)
Figure 6 – Inspection for Cracks

## 6.1.8 Verification of cracks

A 10x magnifying glass may be used to confirm the existence or extent of a suspected crack.

A "visual inspection" is defined as the process of using the eye, alone or in conjunction with various aids, as the sensing mechanism from which judgments may be made about the condition of a unit to be inspected.

This level of inspection is made from within touching distance unless otherwise specified. A mirror may be necessary to enhance visual access to all exposed surfaces in the inspection area. This level of inspection is made under normally available lighting conditions such as daylight, hangar lighting, flashlight, or droplight. A visual inspection may require the removal or opening of access panels or doors. Stands, ladders, or platforms may be required to gain proximity to the area being checked.

The inspection criteria provided below is intended as general guidance. Conduct special inspection as deemed appropriate by each operator based on aircraft experience. Any discrepancies found should be repaired.

## 6.2 Wiring

The inspection criteria provided below is intended as general guidance. Special inspection should be conducted as deemed appropriate by each operator. Any discrepancies found should be repaired.

### a. Wire/Wire Bundle – Inspect for:

- Aluminum drill shavings, lint or dust on or inside wire bundles. Aluminum shavings can, with vibration or other motion, cut through wire insulation and provide a conductive path between wires in a bundle or to adjacent grounded structure. Lint and dust can accumulate on wire bundles and may, if subjected to overheated wires, ignite or possibly feed an electrical fire.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS

- Wire insulation that has become brittle. Wire may be more susceptible to cracking. Damaged insulation and/or exposed conductor material of wires. Cracked, chafed and cut insulation can provide a conductive path between wires in a bundle or to adjacent grounded structure.
- Pinched wires can occur at wire clamps, connector backshell clamps, excessively tight cable ties, etc.
- Inappropriate/improper wiring repairs such as the use of duct tape, electrical tape, poor crimp splices, etc.
- Wire insulation damage due to fluid leaks (i.e. fuel, hydraulic fluid, etc.)
- Separation of electrical wires from hydraulic, fuel and oxygen lines. Ensure a minimum of 0.5-inch separation and any wiring routed within 2.0 inches must be clamped to provide separation.
- Small bend radii of wire. Wiring subjected to excessively tight bend radii may sustain damage to the wire insulation.
- Sagging wire bundles. Ensure bundles are not allowed to droop onto structure, components, cables, hoses, other bundles, etc.
- Wire attached to the outside of a wire bundle using plastic ties instead of being installed under existing wire clamps. Can cause chafed and cut wire insulation.
- Unsupported wires running into conduit or wire supported in such a way as to pull the wire against the side of the conduit entrance instead of into the center. Can cause chafed and cut wire insulation.
- Proximity to high temperature equipment. Wiring shall be kept separate from high temperature equipment, such as resistors, exhaust stacks, heating ducts and deicers, to prevent wire insulation deterioration.
- Wires with different insulation types should not be routed together, where possible. Certain wire insulations may be easily abraded by other types of wire insulation.

b. Wire Harness Clamps – Inspect for:
- Condition. Ensure any protective material on the wire clamp (i.e. rubber, plastic, etc.) is in serviceable and functional condition. Clamps should be secured to structure and wire bundle should be snug in clamp.
- Ensure clamps are not installed over splices.

c. Connectors – Inspect for:
- Condition. Make sure connectors are free of corrosion, moisture, dust and metal shavings. Check for worn environmental seals, loose contact tension, proper contact locking, missing seal plugs, missing dummy contacts, etc. Drip loops should be maintained when connectors are below the level of the harness and tight bends at connectors should be avoided or corrected.

d. Backshells – Inspect for:
- Condition: Wires may break at connector backshells due to excessive flexing, lack of strain relief or improper buildup. Loss of backshell bonding may also occur due to these and other factors.

e. Electrical Conduits and Sleeving – Inspect for:
- Susceptibility to water/moisture entrance: Conduits should not be susceptible to the entrance of moisture. If moisture going into conduits and sleeving is unavoidable, provisions should be made in the lower portions of the conduit to drain any moisture and prevent accumulation.
- Condition: Damage to sleeving and conduits, if not corrected, will often lead to wire damage. Make sure components are free from corrosion, moisture, dust, and metal shavings. Check that conduit is secured to structure.

f. Terminations – Inspect for:
- Condition: Terminal lugs and splices are susceptible to mechanical damage, corrosion, heat damage and chemical contamination. The buildup and nut torque on wire lugs is critical to their performance.

g. Grounding Points – Inspect for:
- Condition: Grounding points should be checked for security (i.e. tightness) condition of termination, cleanliness and corrosion. Any grounding points that have corroded or have lost their protective coating should be repaired and checked for proper resistance.

# CAUTION

Use care when disturbing or removing wire harness/bundles to minimize the possibility of wire insulation damage or cracking. Care must be especially used in areas with severe moisture problems. During any repair, modification, or installation work in close proximity to wire bundles, mounts, connectors and systems, ensure that these areas are protected from and/or cleaned of metal shavings and debris.

# 1. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the structural substantiation to applicable 14 CFR Part 25 regulations as they relate to the installation and modification of various interior cabinets on Beechcraft Model 400A, S/N's RK-244 and RK-305, for a FAA Form 337 major alteration, performed by Constant Aviation at their Cleveland, OH facility.

The installations consist of the replacement of new RH and LH forward galleys, and modification to the existing closet frame, an extension of the aft lavatory, and a modification to the side-facing divan with the manufacturer's approval. Everything except the new LH forward galley has been accomplished on a previous modification as documented in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. Therefore, only the new galley will be discussed and analyzed in this report. The floorplan for the two (2) Beechcraft Model 400A aircraft is as shown below.

## 4. DESCRIPTION

### 4.1 General

The modification of the Model 400A aircraft consists of replacing the existing RH and LH forward cabinets with new assemblies, modifying the RH forward 3-place side-facing divan by refurbing the divan, and modifying the existing LH aft lavatory cabinet by extending its cabinet structure to close out the area around it. All but the new LH galley are previously installed and certified on previous 400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001.

### 4.2 RH Forward Galley Assy &amp; Instl

The NXT0313-01 RH forward galley assembly (installed per NXT0313-02) is the same as that previously installed on other Model 400A aircraft. An illustration of the galley in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1 – RH Forward GalleyAssy (Contact Pad on Upper Area Not Shown)

The galley is manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-inch thick ATR-FP-501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR Composites, and fabricated using ATR panel pin construction.

The RH forward galley is installed between the existing RH forward structural partition (which separates the flight deck with the cabin) forward of it and the 3-place side-facing divan immediately aft of it. The lower wider section of the cabinet also encloses the aircraft's air conditioning evaporator mounted separately to the floor structure underneath.

## 4.3 RH Forward Divan Modification

The NXT0313-03 3-place side-facing divan assembly consists of new drawer and fascia door panels onto the existing structural divan frame (Aviation Fabricators D-10666 STC’d Installation Kit - STC ST01572WI). It has also been installed in previous Model 400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. An illustration of the divan assembly is provided in Figure 4-2.

Figure 4-2 - RH Forward Divan Mod

The divan closeout panels are manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-inch thick ATR-FP-501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR Composites, and fabricated using ATR panel pin construction.

The STC'd divan frame installation consists of a structural frame (bottom only - no seat backs, cushions form the divan backs), restraint systems consisting of lap belts and shoulder harnesses for all three (3) seated positions, and a D-106699 floorboard modification installation underneath the divan. The frame installed in eight (8) places into the existing cabinet "Brownline" seat track extrusions (inboard and outboard).

## 4.4 LH Forward Galley Assy &amp; instl

The NXT0213-01 LH forward galley assembly is a traditional aircraft galley and is located between the flight deck and the entry door, directly aft of the existing LH forward structural partition (bulkhead). The new galley replaces an existing galley of similar design and the same size. In fact, this new galley assembly is the same as previously installed in other Model 400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001, except for a minor change to the upper forward portion of the cabinet. As can be seen in a comparison of the galley illustrations below and Fig. 4-3 of 222-ST-001, the change consists of eliminating the small recessed condiment tray drawer and extending (down) the existing compartment to compensate.

The galley is manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-inch thick ATR-FP-501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR Composites, and fabricated using ATR panel pin construction.

An illustration of the LH forward galley is provided in Figure 4-3.

Figure 4-3 – LH Forward Galley Assy

The LH forward galley is installed per NXT0213-02 and is installed utilizing the same existing installation attachments – five (5) screw/insert attachments into the existing partition and four (4) floor attachments (2 into the existing seat track and 2 into existing floorboard mounts, and is the same as the previous NXT0313-05 installation analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001.

The empty cabinet weights 86.15 pounds (less than the 90.61 pound galley analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001) and the total placarded content weight (Ref. NXT0213-05) of 141.0 pounds (only 1.0 pound more than the 222-ST-001 analyzed galley). Therefore, the total installation weight of the NXT0213-02 galley is 3.46 pounds lighter than that analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001, and is therefore structurally substantiated by comparison.

## 4.5 LH Aft Lavatory Extension

The NXT0313-07 LH aft lavatory modification consists of augmenting the toilet cabinet with new panels and compartments between the existing cabinet and the RH aft partition. An illustration of the modification to the aft lavatory is shown in Figure 4-4 (new components in gray).

![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)
Figure 4-4 – LH Aft Lavatory Extension

This is the same as previously analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001.

## 5. STRUCTURAL SUBSTANTIATION

The structural analysis will be generated using traditional means based on conservative assumptions.

In determining the Margin of Safety (MS), the resulting analytical result will be subtracted from 1.0 so that any MS greater than 0.0 is considered a positive margin. Also, MS’s greater than 3.0 will be listed as “+Ample”.

## 5.1 LH Forward Galley Assy &amp; Instl

The critical loadings for the LH forward galley are the 9.0g forward and 3.5g side load conditions. However, since the new galley weighs 3.5 pounds less than the previously analyzed galley, is of similar shape and design, includes that same installed equipment, and utilizing the same aircraft attachment points, the new galley assembly and installation is therefore structural substantiated by comparison.

The largest placarded drawer is the top, center drawer in the lower section of the galley, which is placarded for 45.0 pounds. The drawer is restrained by a standard Actron paddle latch, P/N A23511-1S. The applied load to the latch is (the drawer itself + hardware is 5.0 pounds):

$$
\text{Applied Load} = (5.0 \text{ lbs} + 45.0 \text{ lbs}) \times 3.5g \times 1.15ff = 201.3 \text{ pounds}
$$

The minimum load rating for the A23511 paddle latch by its manufacturer is 225.0 pounds. The resulting margin of safety is:

$$
\text{M.S.} = 225.0 \text{ lbs} / 201.3 \text{ lbs} - 1.0 = +0.12
$$

## 6. CONCLUSION

Based on the above structural analysis, the new cabinets and modification and their installations, listed in Sect. 2.1, into the aircraft have been shown to be compliant with the applicable 14 CFR Part 25 regulations, as defined in Sect. 3 with positive margins of safety.

# 2.0 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND OVERHAUL SCHEDULE

1. To comply with 14 CFR 25.1529, continue the new divan assembly (with restraint system) on the same inspection and maintenance schedule used per the Hawker Beechcraft Maintenance Manual for cabin section inspections.

a. The new cabin configuration components require no service other than inspection at normal inspection interval of 200 hours.

b. The safety belts require no service other than inspection at normal inspection interval of every 200 hours.

c. Perform a detailed visual inspection of each passenger seat bottom and back cushions and covering of all cabin interior components to detect apparent or obvious defects or irregularities.

On the cushion assembly, check for cracks and punctures within a 4" diameter circle. The cushion assembly can have no more than three defects found within the 4" diameter circle. If a cushion develops a "lump", check to see if there are no more than two lumps within a 4" diameter circle. Any damage to the cushions outside of the described limits will require them to be replaced.

Visually inspect the covering assemblies for holes, punctures, and tears. If the damage to the covering is holes smaller than ½" in diameter or a cut at a maximum of 2" in length then the covering is satisfactory. The sewing of the cover assemblies is not to exceed 1" tearing. Any damage to the covering assemblies outside of the described limits will require them to be replaced.

d. Visually inspect the divan and seat assembly tubes and diaphragm for cracks and deformation. Damaged conditions could be detected as a crack at the edge of the tube or along the length of the tubes or as a crack, tear or cut found on the seat bottom or back diaphragm. Visually inspect all hardware for excessive wear before and after installation.

Replace the seat back and bottom diaphragm if two cracks or deformations are found with a 4" diameter circle. If a tear or cut is found with a maximum of 6", replace the diaphragm.

There shall be no broken tubes. There shall be no sharp corners, edges, or protrusions that may injure passengers. Replace the tubes if they are bent in such a way that they are more than 2" off center. Replace the seat tubes if crack length is found to be .125" or greater. Replace the tube if a dent is found running longer than 3". Replace the seat tubes if deformation is greater than .25" the overall thickness of the tube diameter.

Cracked or broken fasteners or fittings are to be replaced with new immediately.

|  Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) Mount Installation Procedures For Flight Options, LLC., Beechjet 400A's  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|  Item | Work Description |   |   | Mechanic | Inspected  |   |
|  01 | Document the maintenance action on a Flight Options maintenance transaction report form, FO-501 with the following statement in the discrepancy side: "Accomplishment of Flight Options EO M25-10/05-011 Installation of the Electronic Flight Bag, FG3500 mount assembly is due". |   |   |  |   |   |
|  02 | Remove electrical power from aircraft and disconnect main aircraft battery. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  03 | Loosen the upper glare shield and right side cover (which contains the reading light and air-cell phone assemblies) by removing the mounting screws and separating the Velcro strips. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  04 | Remove the three screws and 90 degree cover panel form the aft edge of the right side cover panel and discard. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  05 | With the glare shield and right side cover disconnected, locate the pre-existing fastener holes located on the shelf just below the copilots windshield and temporarily install the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) mount assembly using the four AN3-5A bolts and NAS1149F0363P plain washers (included in the kit) to the pre-existing fastener holes. Snug but do not tighten bolts at this time. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  06 | Adjust the position of the EFB mount assembly to provide sufficient clearance between the existing ashtray and the EFB mount thumbscrew. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  07 | When proper clearance is achieved in step five, (thumbscrew does not touch the ashtray when rotated), tighten mounting bolts to 22 to 28 inch pounds (AMM Chap 20). |   |   |  |   |   |
|  08 | Reinstall the right side panel. Trim the aft edge of the panel as necessary to provide clearance between the panel and the 1175TA bracket, as identified in engineering Directive EDW01-5, figure 2, on page 3. Trim leather covering as necessary and secure with adhesive (contact cement or equivalent). |   |   |  |   |   |
|  09 | Verify condition of Velcro on the upper glareshield and right side panel for proper security. Secure as necessary. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  10 | Install the EFB computer (Fujitsu) into the holder bracket. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  11 | With the EFB mount installed, loosen the thumbscrew knob on the mount assembly ½ to one full turn maximum (do not allow the "Hold-It arm to separate from the mechanical stop pin in the drawing number 1175 mount bracket). |   |   |  |   |   |
|  12 | With the EFB mount assembly arm loose; verify the co-pilots control column and wheel does not come in contact with the EFB mount assembly using the following procedure: Perform this task by moving the control column full travel forward and aft and rotating the control wheel full left and right while also rotating the EFB mount assembly in all possible configurations. Verify that the EFB mount assembly does not make contact with any part of the control yoke and wheel. If contact does not occur, proceed to step 17 and N/A and initial blocks 13 through 16. |   |   |  |   |   |

|  13 | If contact occurs, remove the mount assembly "Hold-It" arm, identified in figure 2 of engineering directive EDW01-5, page 3, by completely removing the thumbscrew. Take note not to lose the wedge shaped bushing located in the eye of the "Hold-It" arm which supplies the locking feature of the mount assembly. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  14 | Locate the small Allen type set screws and adjust as necessary to move the arm towards the more vertical position. Make ¼ turn adjustments at a time. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  15 | Reinstall the "Hold-It" arm assembly, taking note to install the wedge bushing with the tapered end first into the eye of the arm assembly and tighten the thumbscrew. Caution: Make sure the mechanical stop pin located on the drawing number 1175 mount bracket fits within the machined slot on the inside part of the eye portion of the "Hold-It" arm assembly. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  16 | Repeat steps 10 through 14 until proper clearance between the control yoke and the EFB is achieved. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  17 | After the final adjustments are made to the Allen type set adjustment screws, apply a small amount of Loctite 242 to the screw threads to secure from loosening. |   |   |  |   |   |
|  18 | Resecure the upper glareshield to the right side panel by reinstalling the mounting screws and resecuring the Velcro strips. |   |   |  |   |   |

(If more space is required, attach additional sheets. Identify with aircraft nationality and registration mark and date work completed.)

Installed the following equipment in Beechcraft 400A S/N RK-244:

|  Equipment | Install Manual | Maintenance Manual | Pilot's Guide  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  TAWS 8000 (Class B) | 009-18001-001
Current Revision | N/A | 009-18000-001
Current Revision  |

Installed Goodrich Avionics Systems Landmark TAWS8000 system (TSO-C151a Class B) using Flight Options LLC electrical drawing 400-3446-20-01 and applicable manufacturers installation manuals listed above.

This installation includes the optional Terrain Display function.

FAA Approved Flight Manual Supplement 400-3446-20 must be on board the aircraft when the Class B TAWS 8000 system is in use.

The TAWS 8000 system has been previously approved for multiple Beechjet aircraft under STC ST01881CH-D, with the Terrain Display function enabled. This installation has been inspected and found to conform to the operational and technical characteristics of STC ST01881CH-D with minor deviations in location of switching relays and wiring interface points as depicted on Flight Options-LLC drawing 400-3446-20-01. Similarity to STC ST01881CH-D is the basis for this request for field approval.

Using the respective manufacturer's instructions for post-installation ground tests, performed operational checks on all systems. The systems performed to manufacturer's specifications and no interference to existing aircraft systems was noted.

In addition to specific instructions contained in the manufacturer's installation manual(s) noted above, all physical mounting considerations were made with reference to AC 43.13-2A, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 11 as they apply to this installation. Regarding attachment to additional structure all alterations were inspected to comply with the aircraft manufacturer's structural repair and alteration specifications.

In addition to specific instructions contained in the manufacturer's installation manual(s) noted above, wire bundles were fabricated using MIL-SPEC, Tefzel wire, that meets the acceptability requirements of AC43.13-1B, Chapter 11, Section 7, Paragraph 11-85 (a) and/or (b), paragraph 11-88, and paragraph 11-89. All wiring was marked in accordance with AC43.13-1B, Chapter 11, Section 16, Para. 11-206, 11-207, 11-208 (a) and/or (b) and 11-210 (a) and (b). Individual wires were formed into bundles by lacing and tying using the techniques described in AC43.13-1B, Chapter 11, Section 12, paragraph 11-158 (a) and (b). Cables were routed and secured in the aircraft using AC43.13-1B, Chapter 11, Section 8, Para.11-96, (a) through (gg) as a guide.

An electrical load analysis was performed per AC43.13-1B Chapter 11 Section 3 Paragraph 36. The maximum probable continuous electrical load does not exceed 80% of the generator(s) output capacity. All compasses aboard this aircraft were checked for accuracy on completion of this installation. The aircraft equipment list and weight and balance were updated.

Instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for this aircraft alteration and interfacing components are as follows;

1. Introduction to the aircraft altered is explained above.
2. Description of the major alteration is explained above.
3. Operation information is described in the documents listed above for each particular product.

# USERINSTALLER RESPONSIBILITIES

It is important to understand that the existence of this document alone does not automatically constitute authority to install the part/component/assembly.

Where the user/installer works in accordance with the national regulations of an Airworthiness Authority different than the Airworthiness Authority of the country specified in block 1, it is essential that the user/installer ensures that his/her Airworthiness Authority accepts parts/components/assemblies from the Airworthiness Authority of the country specified in block 1.

Statements 14 and 19 do not constitute installation certification. In all cases the aircraft technical maintenance record must contain a maintenance installation certification issued in accordance with the national regulation by the user/installer before the aircraft may be flown.

24-0078 (1999-10)

# RESPONSABILITÉS DE L'USAGER/MONTEUR

Il est important de bien comprendre que de par son existence ce document ne constitue pas forcément l'autorisation d'installer la pièce/composant/ensemble.

Lorsque l'usager/monteur(euse) travaille conformément aux règlements nationaux d'une autorité de navigabilité, autre que l'autorité de navigabilité inscrite à la case 1, il est essentiel que l'usager/monteur(euse) s'assure que son autorité de navigabilité accepte les pièces/composants/ensembles de l'autorité de navigabilité inscrite à la case 1.

Les déclarations apparaissant aux cases 14 et 19 ne constituent pas une certification de montage. En tout temps le dossier technique de l'aéronef doit contenir une certification après maintenance émise selon les règlements nationaux, par l'usager/monteur(euse), avant que l'aéronef puisse décoller.
