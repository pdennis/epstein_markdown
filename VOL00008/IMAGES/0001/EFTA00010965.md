Good morning,

This superseding indictment does not appear to have been docketed on ECF. Would it be possible to please docket it today so that the Court and the defendant have notice of the new indictment before next week's arraignment?

I have attached a color scan of the signed indictment, which can be filed.

Thank you,

Good afternoon,

Attached is the grand jury return for US v. Maxwell, which was previously wheeled out to Judge Nathan in Manhattan. The superseding indictment is unsealed. There are no warrants for this matter.
