Hi _________________________________________________________________________

and I are the AUSAs working with _________________________________________________________________________ on the Epstein investigation, and we wanted to briefly be in touch because _________________________________________________________________________ mentioned there's some concern about having our office manage documents with a vendor (for scanning, cataloguing, and indexing), and she said it would be helpful for us to provide some examples of cases where that has been done in the past. We have a number of examples, and we're hoping to quickly chat with you about the most productive way to get that info to you—is there a good time for us to give you a call sometime early next week? We're happy to work around your schedule, and we really appreciate the help.

Thanks very much, and talk soon,
