Your Portfolio at a Glance: Reflects the net equity of your account at the close of the statement period, the net equity of your last statement and any change since the last statement.

Market Value of Your Portfolio: A graph reflecting the change in the market value of your account portfolio from the market value reflected on your last statement (Cash/Cash Equivalent, Equities, Mutual Funds, Fixed Income, Other).

Cash Flow Analysis and Cash Balance Summary: Both show your opening and closing balances. Cash Flow Analysis reflects the categories of cash activity. Cash Balance Summary reflects the cash balances by account type. Opening Balance is the credit or debit carried over from the previous periods closing balance. Closing Balance is the combination of the total debits and credits for the statement period together with the opening cash balance. A debit balance (money you owe us) is indicated by a minus sign in these sections.

Income Summary: Reflects the total dividend, interest and other income amounts for the statement period and year to date. Any tax withheld, margin interest and miscellaneous charges are included here if applicable.

Distribution Summary: Reflects returns on capital, liquidations, and other income for the statement period and current year.

Your Portfolio Allocation: A pie chart defining your asset allocations (Cash/Cash Equivalent, Equities, Mutual Funds, Fixed Income, Other).

Portfolio Composition: Reflects a summary of cash/cash equivalent, equities, mutual funds, and fixed income for the statement period.

Bonds with 90 - Day Horizon: Reflects bonds that will mature or are subject to redemption within the next 90 days.

Your Portfolio Holdings: Reflects cash and all securities in your account. Estimated annual income is based on the dividend or income expected to be received annually. Account interest represents interest earned but not yet paid or collected on fixed income securities since the last coupon date. There is no guarantee that this interest will be paid by the issuer. Current yield is calculated by dividing the estimated annual income by the market value of the securities and represents an estimated current yield only.

Market Prices/Bond Ratings:

The market value of your holdings are as of the last business day of the statement period. Prices for determining market values represent estimates. These estimates are obtained from multiple sources, including Bear Stearns, its affiliates and outside services. Pricing estimates may be based on bids, prices within the bid/offer spread, closing prices or matrix methodology that uses data relating to other securities whose prices are more assertifiable to produce a hypothetical price based on the estimated yield spread relationship between the securities. Pricing estimates do not constitute bids for any securities. Actual prices realized at sale may be more or less than those shown on your statement. Bond ratings are received from outside sources. While we believe our sources for market values and bond ratings to be reliable, we cannot guarantee their accuracy.

The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely as a general indication of performance and should not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon without the assistance of your tax advisor. With respect to security positions received into your account, cost basis information, if any, has been provided by you.

Cost basis information relating to securities positions consisting of more than twenty tax lots (purchases and re-investments) is displayed in the aggregate as one short term and one long term tax lot. Further information is available from your broker.

Cost basis information has been provided by you or by a third party on your behalf, and not by Bear Stearns.

Cost basis information relating to your mutual funds holdings, regardless of the number of tax lots, is displayed in the aggregate as one short term tax lot and one long term tax lot. Further information is available from your broker.

The original cost basis of this position has been adjusted to reflect amortization or accordion.

Transaction Detail: Reflects all transactions setting or processed for your account this statement period.

Trades Executed But Not Yet Settled: This section will reflect any trades not yet settled by the statement closing date. The settlement date is indicated in the first column.
