Thank you, . We are actually going Friday, but we will give them your regards and those of the agents. I wanted to let you know that Bob heard your voice message and forwarded it to me. I had already told him that we had spoken, that you were writing a letter, which I would mirror, etc. To my knowledge he has not heard from Roy Black and Tien. Thanks for all the help. Kathy

Hi Katherine and Mercy:

I have attached a draft letter to the Florida Bar for your review along with the Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum.

Can you let Amy know that Special Agent is sending the unredacted documents that she requested by Federal Express tonight. They will be addressed to Katherine and will arrive tomorrow.

Please let me know if you need anything else. (I will turn my attention to the Victim Notification Log right now and get that to you in a half-hour.) And please give my regards, and the regards of , to the victims with whom you are meeting tomorrow.

Thank you.
