Subject: Non-Prosecution Agreement in Epstein Case

Date: Tue, 01 Jul 2008 15:50:45 +0000

Importance: Normal

Attachments: Epstein_Agrmt001.pdf

Hi — I am attaching the agreement, with addenda, for filing with the Court under seal.

We also noticed a couple of “misstatements” during the change of plea and wanted to call them to your attention. First, the Division of Corporations’ documents show that the Florida Science Foundation was incorporated in November 2007, not a “couple of years ago” as reported by Mr. Epstein. The address provided for the “office” of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger’s office suite, and neither the office building directory nor the office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security guard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned knows of the existence of such a business. And, of course, Mr. Epstein could not have been working there “every day” when he hasn’t been in Palm Beach County in the past six months.

We will leave it to your discretion as to whether this should be brought to the Court’s attention.
