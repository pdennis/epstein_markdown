Hi

Not a problem. I've attached the indictment. The other filings are on docket 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)—please let me know if you'd like me to download anything else. Here are the materials on our website:

As for other items in our possession that are public, we have both a selection of filings from civil cases that we pulled from public dockets (though I would not necessarily want to reveal which civil suits we tracked), as well as a copy of the FOIA production that FBI Palm Beach produced regarding the initial investigation.

Thanks,

further to the little meeting we had a couple weeks ago, could you kindly pull together the Epstein press releases and charges and anything else we made public? (I don't think you need to download everything from the docket, tho.)
