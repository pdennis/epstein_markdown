Can you guys provide us with at least a 100GB hard drive so that FBI CART to download the material? Let me know when and where I can pick up.

Hey

I know FBI was taking photos of the SHU generally and measuring the number of steps from Epstein's cell to the guard desk. Do you have those photos and can you provide them to us? Thank you.

Also, let us know if you need a hard drive from us for [redacted] phone.

Thanks.
