Attached please find the cite-checked omnibus memorandum of law in opposition to Maxwell's motions. The team will be working with the paralegals tomorrow to proofread (which will include cleaning up the TOA), get out the discovery that we reference in the MOL, and deal with redactions before filing. You'll see that we have highlighted portions that we tentatively expect to redact in green.

Thanks,
