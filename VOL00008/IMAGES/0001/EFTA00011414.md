Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Images from Epstein devices

Hey

I was in the office all weekend. I am done with all but 5 or 6 machines. I will be able to get you what I have tomorrow afternoon and the remaining as I get them.

Hi

Hope you enjoyed the long weekend. I'm checking in to see whether you have a sense of when our office might begin receiving copies of the images from all of the Epstein devices from the New York and Virgin Island searches. Any sense of timing would be much appreciated.

Thanks very much,
