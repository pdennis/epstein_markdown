Can you send the photos again? Only the photo booth ones came through. I want to attach them to the 302.

Thanks!

Hi Brad,

Just following up on this—we're happy to take these by whatever method is easiest for you. One option would be to mail us a CD or thumb drive, but please let us know what works for you. On the subject of documents relating to [redacted], do you have any photographs of her from the relevant time period? Or are you able to ask her if she has them?

Thanks,

Hi Brittany,

We met with [redacted] last week in California, which was helpful. She mentioned that she had provided you with a batch of emails relating to her encounters with Epstein. She indicated that she would be willing to share those with us, and that we should contact you to coordinate. Are you able to share those documents with us? If you have any questions or if you think a call would be helpful to discuss, please let us know.

Thanks,
