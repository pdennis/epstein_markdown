Hi [REDACTED] and Alex – We just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could have been there to see how much this has affected them.

One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview twice within a 20 minute span. She regained her composure enough to continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares about Epstein coming after her and she started to break down again, so we stopped the interview.

The second girl, who has a baby girl of her own, told us that she was very upset about the 18 month deal she had read about in the paper. She said that 18 months was nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.

The FBI's victim-witness coordinator attended and she has arranged for counseling for several of the girls.

Please reach out to [REDACTED] to make her decision. These girls deserve so much better than they have received so far, and I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.

We have four more girls coming in tomorrow. Can I persuade you to attend?
