Good Afternoon.

I am a looking at the petition and affidavit that you sent and were wondering if it would be possible for you to send us a copy of the letters that were sent to the victims in this case. The AUSA refers to attached copies in her affidavit at #3.

We are working on this and will respond to you ASAP.

Thanks.
