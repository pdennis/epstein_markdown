I am out today, but I will start pulling everything together tomorrow. We don't have transcripts of all of the state interviews, but we have audio or videotapes of all of them.

I drafted the attached letter, which I would like to send to Jay.

In light of the recent Kirkland &amp; Ellis correspondence, I've asked [redacted] to conduct a de novo review of the evidence underlying the proposed indictment. I've provided [redacted] with the proposed indictment package but can you make copies of the 302s, state GJ and interview transcripts, and any other underlying investigative information that [redacted] can review a.s.a.p.? Thanks,
