Thought you would like to see what I sent
- Have a great time

I just gave Andrew your telephone no. He is interested in seeing the Nazca
Lines. He can ride but it is not his favorite sport ie pass on the horses.
Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun
and from good families) and he will be very happy. I know I can rely on you
to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be friendly and discreet and fun.
He does not want to read about any trip in the papers whom or what he saw.
Call me if you have any questions - otherwise you can expect a very English
sounding gentleman on the phone to call up and say hi. I told him it would
be best if he made his plans directly with you.
The only part that I am jealous about is that he will get to see you and
that he will be in Peru and have you as his tour guide for a day

Besos
