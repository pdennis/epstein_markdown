No telling how long the DAG's office will take to decide. Tuesday is off.

Hi [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] I received [REDACTED] e-mail stating that the DAG agreed to meet with Epstein's people. Does this mean that Tuesday is off? I need to let the gj coordinator know.

Also, I am sure that you remember [REDACTED]. She was the person whom we initially classified as a victim until Epstein's attorneys complained. Well, [REDACTED] has just interviewed a girl who was 14 or 15 when she first went to Epstein's house who reports that Epstein told her that he had sex with [REDACTED] probably would have been 15 or 16 when this conversation occurred.) The girl also reports that she told Epstein her true age and Epstein told her that he doesn't care about age.

I know that Epstein's people will, no doubt, continue to tell the dag and others that Epstein didn't know about the girls' ages so I thought you should know.

Please let me know about Tuesday so I don't needlessly spoil [REDACTED] Sunday. And, any chance the case was discussed with the ag when he was in town?

Thanks.
