Subject: Unit Update Reports

Last month I sent you all a new template for monthly reports. With apologies for those who have sent in their reports without using that template, please kindly resubmit using the new template. The new template also includes a section on specially allocated FTE. Here is the specially allocated FTE report for the last two months.
