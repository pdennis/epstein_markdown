Gentlemen:

This Office has completed a thorough review of the U.S. Attorney’s handling of the matter involving your client, Jeffrey Epstein. We have received and reviewed your letters of May 19, June 3 and June 19, 2008, the attachments to the June 19 letter, as well as your submissions to the Criminal Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Additionally, we have reviewed an extensive set of materials provided by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and conferred with a number of highly experienced Department attorneys about this matter. The Deputy Attorney General has also been briefed.

As you know, the Department of Justice vests considerable discretion in its U.S. Attorneys, and the Deputy Attorney General will intervene in only the most unusual of circumstances. We do not believe such intervention is warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution of this case is appropriate. Moreover, having reviewed your allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and the facts underlying them, we see nothing in the conduct of the U.S. Attorney’s Office that gives us any reason to alter our opinion.

Sincerely,

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Senior Associate Deputy Attorney General
