# NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIMS

On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as “Epstein”) entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009495AXXXMB and 2008-___________) and was sentenced to a term of eighteen months’ imprisonment to be followed by ___ years of probation.

In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, and pursuant to the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement between Epstein and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (hereinafter referred to as “the Office”), the Office hereby provides notice to Epstein that the following is a list of individuals whom the Office was prepared to name as victims in an Indictment charging Epstein with violations of federal statutes enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255 (hereinafter referred to as “identified individuals”).

The terms of the deferred prosecution agreement provide that the identified individuals shall have the same right to seek damages pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, as they would have had if Mr. Epstein had been tried and convicted of those enumerated offenses in a federal court. Section 2255 provides, in relevant part:

Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section . . . 2422, or 2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value.

Thus, pursuant to the deferred prosecution Agreement between the Office and Epstein, the Office hereby provides Notice to the identified individuals that each of them is a person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, committed by Epstein. The Office further provides Notice to the identified individuals that, pursuant to the Agreement between the Office and Epstein, a copy of this document may be introduced in a judicial proceeding between any such identified individual and Epstein, and that any judicial authority interpreting this Notification, including any authority determining what evidentiary burdens, if any, a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of Epstein and the Office to place the identified individuals in the same position as they would have been had Epstein been convicted of those federal offenses.
