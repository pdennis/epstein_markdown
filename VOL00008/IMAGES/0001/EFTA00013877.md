Dear Roy and Jack:

I have been reviewing the deferred prosecution agreement and wanted to remind you that the agreement states: "Epstein shall provide to the U.S. Attorney's Office copies of all proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office prior to entering into those agreements." Please provide me with any proposed agreements at your earliest opportunity, and also please provide me with the date and time of the change of plea.

Thank you.
