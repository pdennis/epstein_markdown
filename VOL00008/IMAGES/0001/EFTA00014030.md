Subject: Epstein

I saw the PB Police Chief this morning and he told me about these articles in Saturday's Palm Beach Daily News. One is an article and the other is an editorial.

One of them makes clear that our office was not informed of the release until well after the fact.

I told the Chief that we had written a letter to the Sheriff's Office and he said he would use a public records request to get a copy.
