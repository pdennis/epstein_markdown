Re: Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Ms. Kaplan:

I write in response to the your letter dated February 25, 2020, seeking documents from the Department of Justice ("DOJ") related to Jeffrey Epstein and plaintiff Jane Doe in *Doe v. Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein*, No. 19-cv-8673 (S.D.N.Y.). As noted in my previous letter dated January 6, 2020, DOJ's response to your request is governed by federal regulations, referred to as "Touhy regulations." See *United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen*, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). Pursuant to these regulations, the United States Attorney has authorized DOJ to provide certain documents responsive to your request. Please find electronic versions of these documents enclosed. The password for these documents will be sent to you by separate cover.

The enclosed documents are as follows:

- Pages numbered DOJ_001-005 are a report of service of a grand jury subpoena on Jane Doe.
- Pages numbered DOJ_006-007 are a report of service of a grand jury subpoena on Jane Doe.
- Pages numbered DOJ_008-009 are a report of service of a grand jury subpoena on Jane Doe.
- Pages numbered DOJ_010-076 are a biographical report of Jane Doe. Pages have been redacted to exclude non-responsive material and references to third parties.
- Pages numbered DOJ_077-078 are a report of contact between Jane Doe and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- Pages numbered DOJ_079-080 are a report of contact between Jane Doe and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- Pages numbered DOJ_081-087 are a document retrieved from an electronic search of a device in Epstein's New York residence in 2019.
- Pages numbered DOJ_088-091 are pages from a document obtained in approximately April 2005 from discarded trash located outside the Palm Beach residence occupied by Jeffrey Epstein.

Please contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to discuss the issues herein further.
