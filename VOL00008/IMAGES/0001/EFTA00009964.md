I'm working though the outstanding requests, specifically those that we sent last week.

The Commissary Reports are in the shared here:

\\usa.doj.gov\cloud\nys\StAndrews\Shared\InReEpsteinDeath-2019R01059\Evidence\Epstein General BOP Records

Additionally, the records for , , and (no or ) are here as well (in the same document). However, all they entail is a single triview page and nothing else. The actual receipts are only for Epstein, , and .

What I'm not sure on is the signed SHU post order review sheets. I have looked through the files and can't seem to find them anywhere. Albeit I don't know what they look like but I do think I would have recognized them. I will keep looking.

Lastly, are the post orders for SHU the same as the daily assignment roster? I've attached one of them as an example. If so, we are missing several from the time period that we requested (7/1 - 8/10).

I'm going to continue to work through the spreadsheet as well.
