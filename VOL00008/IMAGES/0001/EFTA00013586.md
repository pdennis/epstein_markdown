The clerk's office finally unsealed Tein's reply brief in the Epstein civil litigation. While the agreement was not filed with the court, Tein quotes extensively from the agreement. He also describes the agreement as "a highly unusual and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement."

I still have not heard back from Roy Black regarding the agreement that the defense filed with the state court.
