I think this looks great, Audrey. Much tighter and less repetitive. I think I added one small suggestion on top of comments.

I have been editing this down—it was too long, and also getting the language to be more natural.
I went back and tried to make sure that it was still comported with the indictment (even if not in the exact wording) but let know if it does not.
