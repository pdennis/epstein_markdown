Chiefs,

If you could reach out to your unit and find out, on average, about how many unique victims or potential victims of human trafficking (adult or minor) your unit has interviewed in the past year we would appreciate it. It doesn't matter if the case was charged. We are trying to get a sense of volume. We realize the answer will be rough and likely zero for some units. If you could get back to us by COB Friday we would appreciate it.

Thanks,
