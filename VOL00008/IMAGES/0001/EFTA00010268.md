Hi _________________________.

Yes, thanks – could you please make these bookings:

- Monday, Nov. 4, 7:30 a.m., JetBlue, LGA to PBI (arriving 10:22 a.m.)
- Nov. 4 to Nov. 5, reservation at Hilton West Palm Beach
- Nov. 4, conference room reservation at Hilton West Palm Beach (if you could please have me be listed as the contact person, and put it on my travel card, that seems to be easiest for them in terms of logistics when we're there)
- Tuesday, Nov. 5, 7:53 a.m., JetBlue, PBI to JFK (arriving 10:27 a.m.)

I think that's everything, but please let me know if I'm forgetting anything or if any other info would be useful, and thanks as always.

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
