**CAUTION - EXTERNAL:**

Joe, Ed, here’s what we’re ready to post, unless you have any correction:

Victim Attendance at Trial in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

In orders dated October 14 and November 24, 2021, the S.D.N.Y. Court outlined procedures for public access to the trial in this matter. (Trial began on November 29, 2021, with jury selection.) Specifically, consistent with the District’s COVID-19 protocols, the Court will ensure public access (with COVID-19 distancing) to the trial in the courtroom itself and in several overflow rooms at the courthouse with live feeds of the proceedings. Beyond the live feeds within the courthouse, the trial will not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic dial-in to the proceedings. Victim access will be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office Victim-Witness Coordinator, _______________________________, and Mr. Joseph Pecorino of the Court’s District Executive Office (______________________). Victims who wish to attend the trial may contact either one of those persons for further information.

COVID-19 Protocols. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All visitors must wear a mask that covers the person’s nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and masks with valves are not permitted. If a person does not have an approved mask, a screener will provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. For more information, please see https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/covid-19-coronavirus.

This info on your web page is outdated and is causing the public to try and access the Maxwell matter by phone. Can you pull down the access number info and update with the latest order which says in-person?
