Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

In recognition of the Government's ongoing discovery obligations, today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These discovery materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02742303 through SDNY_GM_02742750. One of the items included in this production is the final report of the Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") regarding the resolution of the 2006-2008 criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (the "OPR Report"). Although the OPR Report is publicly available and accessible through multiple websites, the Government has elected to produce a copy to you as a courtesy.

In addition, due to an inadvertent error in Bates stamping in the prior production, which the Government just discovered, we are reproducing certain of the materials in the below index. These items were originally produced with incorrect Bates numbers that resulted in overlaps. These errors have now been corrected. These discovery materials are now stamped with the correct control numbers SDNY_GM_00328069.001 through SDNY_GM_00328069.794.
