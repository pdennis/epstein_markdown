PCU – Please join me in congratulating _______________ on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. _______________ spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won’t repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and perseverance and creativity by _______________ in building a case based on conduct that I’m pretty sure is older than all of our paralegals.

_______________ will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.
