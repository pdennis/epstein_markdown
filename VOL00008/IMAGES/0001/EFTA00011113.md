Good evening,

The Government filed the letter on ECF this evening. In what format would the Court like a copy of the materials?

Subject: Re: US v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Joint Proposed Juror Questionnaire and Voir Dire

Counsel:

Consistent with the Court's Individual Rules, if one or both sides are requesting sealing, the letter making that request must be docketed on ECF unless counsel is also seeking, with explanation and justification, to file the letter under seal.

The Court would also like a copy of the Jencks Act material and exhibits.

Sincerely,

EFTA00011113

Chambers of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan
