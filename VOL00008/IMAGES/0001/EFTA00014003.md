Everything is out. Copies will be sent to you via inter-office. Thank you, , as usual, you came to the rescue!

Can I ask one more favor? Will you e-file a notice of appearance? That way notices of hearings will come to both of us. I have to run to an appointment, but you can get me on the cell phone.

Thanks.

Subject: Government's Motion to Seal

EFTA00014003

In preparation for this afternoon's filing, I have prepared a motion to seal, which is attached. I did not include Epstein's name and made general assertions regarding the confidentiality of the negotiations. Please have someone sign both the motion to seal, and the government's response, for me. We then need to prepare a sealed document tracking sheet, to accompany the motion.

An original and one copy of the sealed document should be placed in two separate envelopes, with the case number written on the outside. An original and one copy of the motion to seal should be filed with the Clerk.

Thanks.
