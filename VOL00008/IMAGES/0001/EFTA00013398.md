SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

# COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in Illegal Sex Acts)

The Grand Jury charges:

# OVERVIEW

1. The charges set forth herein stem from the role of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including at least in or about 2004, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18.

2. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to

EFTA00013398

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 2 of 24

Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016.

## FACTUAL BACKGROUND

3. During the time periods charged in this Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with Epstein. Additionally, between in or about 1994 and in or about 2004, MAXWELL was paid by Epstein to manage his various properties.

4. Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of means and methods, including but not limited to the following:

a. MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor

EFTA00013399

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 3 of 24

victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending time alone with a minor victim.

b. Having developed a rapport with a victim, MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor victim and Epstein.

c. MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims.

d. In addition, Epstein offered to help some minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel

EFTA00013400

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 4 of 24

indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to help them.

e. Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters.

5. Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the following:

a. A multi-story private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the "New York Residence").

b. An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence").

c. A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence").

d. MAXWELL's personal residence in London, England.

EFTA00013401

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 5 of 24

6. Additionally, beginning at least in or about 2001, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, minor girls to visit Epstein's Palm Beach Residence to engage in sex acts with Epstein, after which Epstein, MAXWELL, or another employee of Epstein's would give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Epstein and MAXWELL encouraged one or more of those victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the victim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein, MAXWELL, and other Epstein employees also paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In this way, Epstein and MAXWELL created a network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit.

7. Between at least in or about 2001 and in or about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Epstein encouraged and enticed one or more minor victims to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein through a variety of means and methods, including but not limited to the following:

a. Epstein's employees, including, at times, MAXWELL, would call a victim to schedule an appointment for the victim to massage Epstein at his Palm Beach Residence. MAXWELL placed at least some of those calls while with Epstein in

EFTA00013402

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 6 of 24

Manhattan, New York. Epstein would often travel from New York to Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments.

b. When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of Epstein's, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then be escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. During these encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask the victim to touch him while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals with his hands or with sex toys.

c. In connection with each sexual encounter, Epstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at times, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash. Each victim was typically paid hundreds of dollars for each encounter.

8. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals,

EFTA00013403

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 7 of 24

placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals.

## MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS

9. Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, Minor Victim-3, and Minor Victim-4. In particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with respect to minor victims:

a. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the

EFTA00013404

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 8 of 24

first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage.

b. MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-

EFTA00013405

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 9 of 24

2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to massage Epstein.

c. MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context of a sexualized massage.

d. Minor Victim-4 was recruited to provide Epstein with sexualized massages for which Minor Victim-4 was paid by Epstein and/or one of his associates, including, at

EFTA00013406

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 10 of 24

times, MAXWELL, at the Palm Beach Residence beginning in or around 2001. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-4 at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence when Minor Victim-4 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-4 on multiple occasions at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence, knowing that Minor Victim-4 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took place between approximately 2001 and 2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim-4 was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence. On multiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Minor Victim-4 provided nude massages to Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence, during which Epstein engaged in multiple sex acts with Minor Victim-4. Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, called Minor Victim-4, including from New York, to schedule appointments for Minor Victim-4 to massage Epstein. After each massage, Epstein or one of his employees, including at times MAXWELL, paid Minor Victim-4 hundreds of dollars in cash. At some point during this period, both Epstein and MAXWELL invited Minor Victim-4 to travel with Epstein and

EFTA00013407

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 11 of 24

offered to assist Minor Victim-4 with obtaining a passport for purposes of such travel, but Minor Victim-4 declined the invitation. On multiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts, including lingerie, from an address in Manhattan, New York to Minor Victim-4's residence in Florida. Epstein and MAXWELL each also encouraged Minor Victim-4 to recruit other young females to provide sexualized massages to Epstein. In response, Minor Victim-4 brought multiple females, including girls under the age of 18, to provide sexualized massages for Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence. On such occasions, both Minor Victim-4 and the girl she brought were paid hundreds of dollars in cash.
