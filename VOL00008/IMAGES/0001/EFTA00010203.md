Department of Justice
Information Technology (IT) Security
Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users
Version 7.0
January 3, 2014

# I. Introduction

The Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users pertain to the use, security, and acceptable level of risk for Department of Justice (DOJ) systems. The rules highlight that taking personal responsibility for the security of an information system and its data is an essential part of your job. As a user of the DOJ Information Technology (IT) data and systems, you are the first line of defense in support of DOJ's IT security.

The intent of the ROB is to acknowledge users' receipt and understanding of applicable IT security requirements from various Federal and DOJ policies and procedures. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, OMB M-07-16, OMB M-05-08, the Privacy Act of 1974, DOJ Order 2640.2 (series), DOJ Order 2740.1 (series), and the DOJ IT Security Standard.

## Who is covered by these rules?

These rules apply to all personnel (government employees and contractors) who perform general non-privileged duties on DOJ information systems, access or use DOJ information, or provide IT services to DOJ – hereafter referred to as users. All users are required to review and provide signature or electronic verification acknowledging compliance with these rules to their respective Component IT Security representative.

Certain authorized personnel may obtain limited exemptions for specific occurrences when performing official duties. These individuals must document situations where equipment and software limitations listed below prevent mission operations. In addition to this ROB, the user shall also agree to and provide signature or electronic verification acknowledging compliance for the Privileged User ROB. The system Authorizing Official (AO) will issue an exemption if the accepted risk(s) and justification is documented and appropriate¹.

## What are the penalties for noncompliance?

Non-compliance with requirements will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of infraction. Actions may include a verbal or written warning, temporary suspension of system access or permanent revocation, reassignment to other duties, or termination, depending on the severity of the violation. In addition, activities that lead to or cause disclosure of classified information may result in criminal prosecution under the U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 798, and other applicable statutes.

Unauthorized browsing or inspection of Federal Taxpayer Information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 7213A) is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to one year imprisonment. Unauthorized disclosure of Tax Return information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 7213) is a felony punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison. In addition to these penalties, any Federal employee convicted under Sec. 7213 or Sec.7213A will be dismissed from employment.

¹ For additional information on mobile device exemptions, please refer to the Department of Justice Mobile Device and Mobile Application Security Policy Instruction v2 (http://dojnet.doj.gov/jmd/irm/itsecurity/documents/FINAL-DOJ_Mobile_Device_and_Application_Security_Policy_Instruction_v2.pdf).

2. Do not generate, download, store, copy, or transmit offensive or inappropriate information in any medium, to include e-mail messages, documents, images, videos, and sound files.
3. Limit distribution of e-mail to only those with a “need to know.”
4. Do not open e-mails from suspicious sources (e.g., people you don’t recognize, know, or normally communicate with) and do not visit untrusted or inappropriate websites (unless authorized). Only download permissible files from known and reliable sources and use virus-checking procedures prior to file use.
5. Protect and safeguard all DOJ information, including personally identifiable information (PII), commensurate with the sensitivity and value of the data at risk. Protect and safeguard all DOJ information and information systems from unauthorized access, unauthorized or inadvertent modification, disclosure, damage, destruction, loss, theft, denial of service, improper sanitization, and improper use.
6. Verify that each computer-readable data extract containing sensitive PII data has been erased within 90 days of origination or that its use is still required.
7. Upon discovery of a known or suspected security incident, report the incident to your Help Desk, Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, or Supervisor.
8. Immediately report lost or stolen devices (e.g., laptop, phone, tablet, thumb drive) to your Help Desk, Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, or Supervisor.
9. Encrypt all DOJ Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data on authorized mobile computers, laptops, tablets, and removable media (e.g., removable hard drives, thumb drives, and DVDs) using Department-approved solutions unless a waiver or policy exemption exists. For classified environments, follow the procedures required for those networks for data storage and transport. All data is considered sensitive unless designated as non-sensitive by the Component Director/Head/Office Head.
10. Read and understand the DOJ security warning banner that appears prior to logging onto the system or mobile device.
11. Screen-lock or log off your computer when leaving the work area, and remove your PIV card, if utilized. Log off when departing for the day.
