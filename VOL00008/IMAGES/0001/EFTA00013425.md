One request from SDNY

Can each device have its own folder so that the images/files you pull out on the device go in its own folder?

Good talking to you today Frank.

[redacted] is getting 3 - 2TB External HDs today and will leave them on [redacted] will Email everyone when they are there for him. If you don't need the 3rd drive you can send it back to us.

On a rolling basis, can Steve let [redacted] know when the HDs are done so we can alert SDNY and coordinate getting them over there. Given the attention this case is getting from EM we want to ensure there are no delays/issues. [redacted] is OCONUS next week on this case so pls copy me on any update Steve has.

Appreciate everyone's help on this as usual.
