Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for another witness in the Maxwell trial—We think he could testify sometime between the afternoon of 12/1 and 12/3. Just to flag that, if we get him off the stand on 12/1 or 12/2, we'll probably want to change his travel so he can be back in by 12/3.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you so much for your help.
