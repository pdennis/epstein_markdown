This was info that got from Barry, the state attorney, but he was waiting for an email to confirm. I am much to lowly to have communications with the "star" team.

Hi sent me an email about epstein wanting to do less time. I hope that his request will be denied. The original deal was supposed to be 2 years so he has already gotten a big break. Plus we have identified more victims since we agreed to the 18 months. Please keep me posted. Thanks.
