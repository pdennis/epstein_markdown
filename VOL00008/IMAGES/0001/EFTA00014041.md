Just talked to . Have you heard anything from lately? I talked to the Captain yesterday and he said was planning to check out E's house. I really think if E is going to run it will be in the next few days.

Hi

I know that asked to get a copy of the Epstein work release case file before she went out of town. Can I stop by to pick it up? I can even make the copies if everyone else has left on vacation.

Thank you.
