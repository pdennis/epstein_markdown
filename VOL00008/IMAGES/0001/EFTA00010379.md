Hi

For whenever you're reviewing the paralegal file: I dropped off an envelope that can go in the para file. I didn't want to go into your office, so I put it in the doorway.

It's the discovery drive that Epstein's attorney's returned to us (consistent with the terms of the protective order) following his death.

Thanks!
