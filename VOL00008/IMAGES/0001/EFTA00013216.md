Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

In recognition of the Government's ongoing discovery obligations, today we are producing copies of the materials listed in the below index, which materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_000174967 through SDNY_GM_00328863. The password for the drive is "USAOsdny1!". The materials are available for pickup at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan.

Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case.¹ This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. An index of the materials contained in this production is below:

|  Bates Start | Bates End | Summary Description | Confidential Designation  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  SDNY_GM_00174967 | SDNY_GM_00270985 | Deutsche Bank records | Confidential  |
|  SDNY_GM_00270986; SDNY_GM_00328070 | SDNY_GM_00323934; SDNY_GM_00328863 | JPMorgan Chase records | Confidential  |
|  SDNY_GM_00323935 | SDNY_GM_00324015 | GM Documents |   |

¹ Files in PDF format designated as "confidential" under the protective order have been stamped "confidential." However, certain files cannot be individually labeled as confidential on the documents themselves due to their file format. Such files include in their electronic names the word "Confidential."

The Government is also reproducing to the defendant the files specified in Defense's September 21, 2020 letter. In order to avoid further difficulties with respect to viewing the files, the Government offers the following instructions:

1. Any .dat, .dvt, and .vol files can be opened and viewed by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Edit with Notepad" or a similar text-viewing program.
2. Any video file can be opened with VLC, which has been included.
3. Accessory files (i.e. .dii, .ami, .cms, etc.) are to be ignored, as they serve no functional purpose besides assisting in the operation of other (i.e. video) files.
4. Any previously flagged files that are not noted here have been converted to PDFs and/or had their file paths shortened to enable viewing.

The Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly produce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody.

Very truly yours,
