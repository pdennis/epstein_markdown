Team unhappy also getting calls. I guess Geoff did mention the location to some people but need to figure out how to keep everyone in loop for anything like this going forward.

All,

I have been getting some questions about the press conference that occurred today at Epstein's mansion, do any of you know that was about? Our media affairs department has been getting questions. In addition, our Victim Specialists have been fielding calls from irate victims who weren't notified.
