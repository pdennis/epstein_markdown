Hi everyone -- Can you please review and comment on the attached? I wanted to give you one more piece of info that will blow your minds.

I finally heard back from Epstein's work release supervisor. She had told that even though Epstein's paperwork shows a late September release date (with credit for gain time), he will actually be eligible for release on July 23rd. I called to ask why and this is the answer. The September date just takes into account statutorily mandated gain time. For each week that he is on work release, he gets an additional two days off of his sentence. Yes, not only does Mr. Epstein get to spend 12 hours each day lounging in his high-rise office building, but he also gets to shorten his sentence by two months in doing so!

So, please let me know what you think. I would like to send it out asap. Thanks.
