As we discussed on our call with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] on Friday, my understanding is that the FBI has ceased reviewing all content from Epstein’s devices and will limit their review of the devices to (a) documents tagged Responsive on Relativity, (b) images and videos identified as Responsive during the review conducted by the FBI and SDNY this fall, and (c) portions of iPads and the iPhone that SDNY identified responsive during our review this fall.

We should plan to do the same going forward. If you guys encounter anything that appears to come from any of Epstein’s devices that you believe was not identified responsive, please let me know, and we can take action to confirm and lock off any nonresponsive material from review.

Hello [REDACTED].

Can you please confirm that the below search is the correct data to secure:

US v. Epstein (SW Returns) - Potentially Non-Responsive - https://d1pe.nss.pae.com/Relativity/go?id=2370462-4350955

Can you also please confirm that the Potentially Non-Responsive data will be placed in two subfolders under the following parent folders:

[REDACTED].

Now that we have completed our responsiveness review in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database, we need to lock off access to any non-responsive materials in that database. Would it be possible to please lock off access to the 397,365 documents in that database that are **NOT** currently tagged "Identified Responsive"? That should leave just the 1,218,719 documents that are tagged "Identified Responsive" accessible to the team for use in our case.

Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be useful.

Thanks very much,
