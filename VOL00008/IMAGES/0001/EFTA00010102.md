**CAUTION - EXTERNAL:**

Chambers,

The Government has been alerted that the filing at Dkt. No. 453 contains a redaction error in which the name of a witness whose identity has been redacted appears. (See Dkt. No. 453 at 11). If the Court would direct the Clerks Office to remove the filing from ECF for the moment, the Government can submit a corrected version today.

Thank you,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York

New York, New York 10007
