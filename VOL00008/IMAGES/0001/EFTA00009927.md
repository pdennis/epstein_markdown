Our Office is providing this laptop to Ms. Maxwell for the sole purpose of reviewing discovery materials in connection with the above-captioned case. Information Technology staff at our Office have reviewed the laptop and confirmed that the laptop has been successfully modified to meet the specifications you have requested. In particular, we have been informed that:

- The laptop contains a microphone and camera, both of which have been disabled. As a result, the laptop has no recording capabilities.
- The laptop does not contain any programs for games.
- Communication capabilities have been disabled. In particular, the laptop has no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Ethernet connection capabilities.

In order to permit Ms. Maxwell to make effective use of this laptop in reviewing her discovery, please permit her to use the accompanying charger to ensure that the laptop remains operational throughout her review periods. Please also permit Ms. Maxwell to review the contents of all discovery hard drives produced by our Office to the MDC in connection with the above-referenced case on this laptop.
