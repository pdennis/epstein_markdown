Importance: Normal

Given the non-disclosure agreement, aren't we left with telling the SAO that we have agreed to not disclose so it wouldn't be proper for us to now agree that unsealing is appropriate. Ultimately, it's the SAO's call because they will get the Florida Public Records Act request and they were not a signatory to the agreement. We should also notify defense counsel so that they can take whatever actions they believe are appropriate. Wait till others have had a chance to weigh in on this issue.

Please advise how you would like us to proceed. The agreement referred to is the Federal Non-Prosecution agreement sealed in the file by the judge at the time of the Epstein plea.

Ms. Belohlavek,

We represent The Palm Beach Daily News. The newspaper recently discovered that a non-prosecution agreement (and an addendum thereto) was filed under seal pursuant to an agreed order entered in the above-referenced case. Because the records are sealed, we cannot assess the propriety of the decision to seal them or even whether the newspaper is interested in the information contained therein. I was hoping you would discuss with me the nature of the agreement and the basis for sealing it so that we can advise our client on whether it should pursue an order unsealing the agreement. Please call me at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,

C. Bryce Albu
Reeder &amp; Reeder P.A.
