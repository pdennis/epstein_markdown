I hope that this email finds you well. I understand that you are in need of CBP assistance – specifically testimony regarding our travel records prior to 2004. We have located an appropriate individual to testify and I would like to facilitate. If you have a moment to discuss please feel free to reach out to my cell number below.

Best,

Senior Attorney
