Dear Jack:

Special Agent [redacted] reminded me that I failed to include one of our identified victims. She is still a minor, and her initials are [redacted].

Please let me know when you are available, and I will provide you with the revised list. I would like to receive the signed notification by tomorrow so that I can begin distributing them to the victims.

Thank you.
