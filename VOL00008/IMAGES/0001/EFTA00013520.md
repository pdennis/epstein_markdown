Subject: Epstein settlement agreement

Good evening. I am the ASA with the Epstein case in Palm Beach County. The negotiated settlement is a definite go. A difficulty arose last week at a conference with the judge on the case. She wants the plea and sentence to occur concurrently; not a plea with a sentencing at a later date. Therefore, the case was set for the first week of January, but the plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that was agreed on by all for the sentencing.

If you have any questions, please contact me at
