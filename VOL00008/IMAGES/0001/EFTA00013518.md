Jay,

Pursuant to our conversation, here is the revised letter and a new addendum. The only change to the addendum is that I renumbered the new paragraphs from A,B, and C to 7A, 7B, and 7C. Once you approve, I will contact Judge Davis and send him the letter. Please execute the addendum, PDF the executed original to me as soon as possible and Fed Ex the original to me thereafter.
