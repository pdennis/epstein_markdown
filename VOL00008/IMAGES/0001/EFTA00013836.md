Next time you are here check the room to see if there is enough space.

It is a variety of stuff but I was hoping to store all of it in the locked gj room on 4 (that is where I had it locked up before it went to 9).

The boxes on the 9th are they grand jury or just case files and info? When you asked about moving them, did you mean to the room the grand jury transcripts are kept here on the 4th floor?
