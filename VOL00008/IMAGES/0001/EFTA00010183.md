Hi team,

Since there are so many moving parts with travel and witnesses we would prefer not see each other, I started putting together a travel chart for [REDACTED]. Attached and saved here: \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Trial\Order of Proof\Travel Chart for [REDACTED]. If you think this makes sense to send her (or at least have to talk her through), please feel free to edit/update.

Thanks!
