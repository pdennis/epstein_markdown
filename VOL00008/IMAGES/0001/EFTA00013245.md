**BSEN**

Been a while – hope you’re well. This was from a while ago, but we need to follow up on the below questions I asked about last year when you scanned in a number of boxes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, now that discovery is underway in the Maxwell case.

The first question is on the discs from the boxes, which you mentioned you did not extract but which you made copies of. Can you please tell us how those discs were marked? We’re not sure that we can tell them apart from the other DVDs we received that contain the hard-copy scans. Did the copied discs get transmitted with those DVDs, or were the sets of four discs kept in the boxes themselves? (And either way, what would their labeling be?)

And second, you mentioned that there were some pornographic images that were not scanned, and said you would follow up to see if a notation was made as to where those images were located or if they could be readily found in output. The issue is that if we don’t know which specific items weren’t scanned in a set of 20-something boxes, we may have no choice but to just do the entire project over again, rather than trying to go page by page comparing the hard copies to the scans to see what’s missing.

Please let us know as soon as possible? And either I or [redacted] cc’d here, will follow up on whatever the next steps are.

thanks,

That’s great, thanks very much for all your and your team’s work and for the update. That makes sense regarding the 1As, thanks.

With respect to the images that were not scanned, is there any way to flag them in the original hard copies somehow, so that we can easily find them and refer to them when the hard copy documents are sent back to New York? Just to avoid needing to try to flip through all the original documents to find them. Let me check and see if a notation was made as to where these images were located or if I can readily/easily find them in output.

Regarding the discs, I’m not sure I totally understand – when you say four copies each, were there just four discs total? Or possibly I’m just misunderstanding the explanation. And related, is it right that those discs were not processed (just copied) so we’ll need to look at those separate for our review? Sorry I should have been clearer. We just copied the discs – not processed and made four copies each which is our standard. The thought being when we burn output we always give a complete set that in theory would go to the defense, AUSA, and two copies to the Agent (one for him/and a back-up). The discs we found in the files contain pdfs (searchable), jpgs, gifs, and tif files

And final question is just how all the scanned materials will be transmitted, so we can plan how most efficiently to receive them and get them processed here. We will send everything back to you on dvds. thanks again,

Good Afternoon!

Here is the latest. We have finished scanning!

In the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 when it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or who is at fault. I can tell you that we were able to conduct a search of our local network and retrieve the images. I spoke with our Field Evidence Unit who recommended that prior to inserting the images we create a cover sheet that reflected that the images were not a part of the "original" paper rather they were regenerated from a digital copy. The 1As in questions are 1A10, 1A28, 1A84 as well as two missing serials in 31E-MM-108062-GJ SEC 001 SER 1-45. My digital team is addressing this matter and has assured me I'll be able to burn the output first thing Monday so that we can get everything returned to you.

A few other items to point out. There were some pornographic images of young girls. These were not imaged per our protocols. You As you review the content anywhere these images may have been you will see a DocLab kicksheet that states "possible child pornography" DO NOT SCAN. The original documents are still in their original location – they were just not scanned.

Finally, there were a number of discs scattered throughout. We made physical copies – one for one ratio of each (four copies each) to go along with the physical paper scanned. These wil be sent along with the discs we will generate.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in bright and early Monday morning.

Gentlemen:

I just wanted to give you a quick update.

We finished inventorying all 22 boxes and released everything to DocLab last evening for scanning. As of this writing we are looking good for meeting the original deadline – give or take a day. We still have a few things to tweak, but I'm confident that things are looking good and we'll have this wrapped up within the next day or two. I'll send you a more detailed email tomorrow morning when I get in.

Take care and have a good evening.

Thanks very much for the update – I think unless you guys can confirm that any prior scans were absolutely 100% done correctly (and separated by document, etc.), we'd prefer to have them just done in one full set now—particularly knowing that this will all be the subject of discovery, which definitely wouldn't have been the case in 2013.

thanks again,

Happy 4th of July Eve. We just received 22 boxes about 5 minutes ago. We discovered that the Miami Field Office had requested DocLab to scan a number of them back in 2013. I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that the images are available on our internal network so that I can access them and just simply reprocess the digital output, if not we'll re-prep and scan accordingly. We will keep you posted.

Take care and have a great holiday.

We're under time pressure but I think the most important thing is that your folks have the time you need to do the job in a way you're comfortable with—being able to scan each document separately, dealing with any random scraps of paper, post-its, etc etc. If doing the best possible job requires an extra few days that's totally understandable, especially given the holiday. Thanks again for the focus on it, and for following up.

I got the scan request thanks.

How much wiggle room can I get on the deadline we originally talked about of 7/10? I'm concerned that with the boxes going from 15 to 22 and now not showing up until sometime tomorrow and Thursday a holiday the 10th is going to be extremely tight. Can I extend out at all to the 16th? If not I understand and we'll work to make it work somehow.

My apologies, apparently with a FedEx pickup this size an appointment had to be setup. The pickup was scheduled for today and will arrive in VA tomorrow, tracking number 4744 7647 0418.

Thanks.
