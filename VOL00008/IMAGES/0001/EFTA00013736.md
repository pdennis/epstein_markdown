Hi [REDACTED] - I just left you a voicemail, so you can disregard that. We had a very good meeting with [REDACTED] on Friday. No one was sure whether you want an FBI presence at the meeting on Friday and [REDACTED] thought I should ask you. Could you let me know? And does the meeting with Epstein’s team start at 2:00? Is there a plan for a pre-meeting meeting with our folks?

Thanks.

[REDACTED]
