Hi [redacted] – Any word from the defense, the State Attorney's Office, or Judge Davis?

Also, [redacted] just told me that two of the girls who were approached by private investigators are girls who were not part of the state's case. Has the list of girls names been distributed to anyone?

Thank you.
