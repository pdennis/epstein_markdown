Sorry, looks like this isn't available in our media monitoring system either. If you'd like, I can ask our contacts at NBC if they'd be willing to give us a copy if it's for internal use only.

Subject: Video Interview?

Hi

I'm trying to find a recorded interview at the below link, but it says it has expired. Do you happen to have this or know how I would get access? Thanks!
