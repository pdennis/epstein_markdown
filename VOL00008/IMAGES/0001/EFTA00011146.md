Subject: Epstein Sharing Order Part II

- I've updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now received. Would you take a look when you can?
- I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized the new stuff we're looking to share?

Thanks,
