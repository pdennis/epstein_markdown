Hi ☐ Yes an agreement has been signed and has already been partially performed. The agreement is confidential and has been filed under seal in the state court proceedings.

He could be filing his motion on behalf of 3 different jane does ☐ Was not fully identified until after the agreement was signed. ☐ was notified and her notification resulted in claims of prosecutorial misconduct by Epstein's lawyers. I am checking to see if the third, ☐, was notified prior to the signing of the agreement.

The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (May 2005) provides that “responsible officials should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.” Article IV, Services to Victims and Witnesses, p. 30.

Has an agreement been signed with Epstein? Did we notify Jane Doe that an agreement was about to be negotiated, and the outlines of that proposed agreement? Thanks.
