Attached is the closing/presentation of government's case that I gave. and can send you the presentations they gave as well. We'll send you a copy of the deliberations when we get the video—let us know where the paras should mail it.

Everyone is putting together a memo of takeaways from the exercise, so we'll forward that when it's compiled so that you have the rundown.

Thanks!
