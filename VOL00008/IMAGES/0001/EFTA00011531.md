Grantor shall not use or permit the Collateral to be used in any manner or for any purpose excepted from or contrary to the requirements of any insurance policy or policies required to be carried and maintained under this Agreement or for any purpose excepted or exempted from or contrary to the insurance policies, nor shall Grantor do any other act or permit anything to be done which could reasonably be expected to invalidate or limit any such insurance policy or policies.

21. Failure to Provide Insurance. Grantor acknowledges and agrees that if Grantor fails to provide any required insurance or fails to continue such insurance in force, Lender may do so at Grantor's expense. The cost of any such insurance, at the option of Lender, shall be added to the Indebtedness. Grantor acknowledges that if Lender so purchases any such insurance, the insurance will provide limited protection against physical damage to the Collateral, up to an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the debt. Grantor's equity in the Collateral may not be insured. In addition, the insurance may not provide any public liability or property damage indemnification and may not meet the requirements of any financial responsibility laws.

22. Application of Insurance Proceeds. Grantor shall promptly (not to exceed seven (7) days) notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Collateral in excess of $50,000, whether or not such casualty or loss is covered by insurance. Lender may make proof of loss if Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty. Lender shall have the right to receive directly the proceeds of any insurance payable to Grantor on the Collateral; and the insurance proceeds shall be paid directly to Lender. If Lender consents to repair or replacement of the damaged or destroyed Collateral, Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of expenditure, pay or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration. If Lender does not consent to repair or replacement of the Collateral, Lender shall retain a sufficient amount of the proceeds to pay all of the Indebtedness, and shall pay the balance to Grantor. Any proceeds which have not been disbursed within six (6) months after their receipt and which Grantor has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Collateral shall be used to prepay the Indebtedness.

23. Insurance Reports. Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to Lender reports on each existing policy of insurance showing such information as Lender may reasonably request including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the property insured; (5) the then current value on the basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of determining that value; and (6) the expiration date of the policy. In addition, Grantor shall upon request by Lender (however not more often than annually) have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine, as applicable, the cash value or replacement cost of the Collateral.

24. Notice of Encumbrances and Events of Default. Grantor shall immediately notify Lender in writing upon the filing of any attachment, lien, judicial process, or claim relating to the Collateral. Grantor additionally agrees to immediately notify Lender in writing

upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, or event that with the passage of time, failure to cure, or giving of notice, may result in an Event of Default under any of Grantor's obligations that may be secured by any presently existing or future Encumbrance, or that may result in an Encumbrance affecting the Collateral, or should the Collateral be seized or attached or levied upon, or threatened by seizure or attachment or levy, by any person other than Lender.

25. Notices of Claims and Litigation. Grantor will promptly inform Lender in writing of (1) all material adverse changes in Grantor's financial condition, (2) all existing and all threatened litigation, claims, investigations, administrative proceedings or similar actions affecting or concerning in any manner the Collateral, and (3) all existing and all threatened litigation, claims, investigations, administrative proceedings or similar actions affecting or concerning in any manner the Grantor or any Guarantor which could materially affect the financial condition of Grantor or the financial condition of any Guarantor.

26. Inspection. Grantor shall permit employees or agents of Lender: (1) to inspect, at Lender's cost, the Aircraft, Engines and APU once per year and thereafter as reasonably requested by Lender; (2) to inspect all other Collateral (including the logs, books, manuals and records comprising or related to the Collateral) for the Indebtedness, at any reasonable time, and (3) to examine or audit Grantor's books, financial statements, accounts, and records and to make copies and memoranda of Grantor's books, financial statements, accounts, and records, at any reasonable time, upon reasonable notice to Grantor; provided, however, upon an Event of Default, Lender may inspect any and all Collateral at any time, at Grantor's expense.

27. Compliance Certificates. Unless waived in writing by Lender, Grantor shall provide Lender within forty-five (45) days after the end of the nine month period following the Funding Date (the "Compliance Due Day") and within ninety (90) days annually of the Compliance Due Day thereafter, with a certificate executed by Grantor's chief financial officer and pilot, or other officer or person acceptable to Lender, certifying that or providing (a) the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are true and correct as of the date of the certificate; (b) as of the date of the certificate, no Event of Default exists under this Agreement; (c) the Grantor has maintained and kept the Collateral in good order and repair and in airworthy condition in accordance with the requirements of each of the manufacturers' manuals and mandatory service bulletins and each of the manufacturers' non-mandatory service bulletins which relate to airworthiness; (d) the Grantor has performed, on all parts of the Collateral, all applicable mandatory airworthiness directives, and regulation of the Federal Aviation Administration; (e) the total number of hours and landings on the Airframe; (f) the total number of hours on the Engines since their last major overhaul or core; (g) verification that the Engines are enrolled in an Engine Maintenance Program; (h) verification that the APU is enrolled in a long-term maintenance program; and (i) the Engine serial numbers.

28. Additional Assurances. Grantor will make, execute and deliver to Lender such promissory notes, mortgages, security agreements, assignments, financing statements, instruments, documents and other agreements as Lender or its attorneys may reasonably request to evidence and secure the Note and/or the Indebtedness.

29. Continuation. The foregoing representations and warranties, and all other representations and warranties contained in the Note, the Related Documents, and this

30.1 Transactions Involving Collateral. Without the prior written consent by Lender, (i) Grantor shall not sell, offer to sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of the Collateral, and (ii) Grantor shall not lease, pledge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise permit the Collateral to be subject to any lien, security interest, encumbrance, or charge, other than the security interest provided for in this Agreement. This includes security interests even if junior in right to the security interests granted under this Agreement. Unless waived by Lender, all proceeds from any disposition of the Collateral (for whatever reason) shall be held in trust for Lender, and shall not be commingled with any other funds; provided however, this requirement shall not constitute consent by Lender to any sale or other disposition. Upon receipt, Grantor shall immediately deliver any such proceeds to Lender.

30.2 No Commercial Use. Grantor shall use the Collateral solely for business purposes. Grantor shall not, without prior written consent of Lender, use the Collateral, or permit the Collateral to be used, in Commercial Operations, except Grantor may operate the Collateral on a FAR Part 135 basis, provided the use is covered by Grantor's insurance policy for the Collateral.

30.3 Removal of the Collateral. Except for routine use, Grantor shall not change the Home Airport or remove the Collateral from the Home Airport without prior written notice to Lender. Grantor shall, if an Event of Default has occurred, advise Lender of the exact location of the Collateral upon Lender's request. Grantor shall not base, or permit the Collateral to be based, outside the continental United States of America.

30.4 Travel Restrictions. Grantor shall not operate or locate the Collateral, or permit the Collateral to be operated, located, or flown (i) outside the continental United States without war risk coverage, (ii) in or over any country for which the U.S. State Department has issued travel restrictions (excluding any such travel restriction made solely with respect to the spread of Covid-19), (iii) in or over any country or jurisdiction that does not maintain full diplomatic relations with the United States, (iv) in or over any area of hostilities, or (v) in or over any geographic area not covered by the insurance then in effect. Without limiting the foregoing, Grantor agrees that at no time during the effectiveness of this Agreement shall the Collateral be operated in, flown over, or temporarily located in any jurisdiction, unless the Geneva Convention, together with its necessary enacting rules and regulations (or some comparable treaty and regulations satisfactory to Lender) shall be in effect in such jurisdiction and any notices, financing statements, documents, or instruments necessary or required, in the

opinion of Lender, to be filed in such jurisdiction shall have been filed and file stamped copies thereof shall have been furnished to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time shall the Collateral be operated in or over any area which may expose Lender to any penalty, fine, sanction or other liability, whether civil or criminal, under any applicable law, rule, treaty or convention; nor may the Collateral be used in any manner which is or may be declared to be illegal and which may thereby render the Collateral liable to confiscation, seizure, detention or destruction.

30.5 No Removal of Parts. Except as permitted or required in the section of this Agreement titled “Maintenance, Use, Repairs, Inspections, and Licenses,” Grantor shall not remove or permit the removal of any parts, engines, accessories, avionics or equipment from the Aircraft without replacing the same with comparable parts, engines, accessories, avionics and equipment acceptable to Lender and the Aircraft’s manufacturer and insurer.

30.6 Modifications. Grantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, modify the Aircraft in any material way, including but not limited to, the Aircraft’s function or operating capability.

31. Future Encumbrances. Grantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, grant any Encumbrance that may affect the Collateral, or any part or parts thereof, nor shall Grantor permit or consent to any Encumbrance attaching to or being filed against the Collateral, or any part or parts thereof, in favor of anyone other than Lender. Grantor shall further promptly pay when due all statements and charges of airport authorities, mechanics, laborers, materialmen, suppliers and others incurred in connection with the use, operation, storage, maintenance and repair of the Aircraft so that no Encumbrance may attach to or be filed against the Aircraft or other Collateral. Grantor shall not file or register (or consent to the filing or registration of) any International Interest, Contract of Sale, or subordination, whether prospective or otherwise (or any amendment, assignment, modification, supplement, subordination or subrogation thereof) pertaining to the Aircraft, with the FAA or the International Registry without the prior written consent of Lender, which may be withheld in its sole discretion. Grantor shall not execute or deliver an IDERA in favor of any party other than the Lender without the prior written consent of Lender, which may be withheld in its sole discretion. Grantor additionally agrees to obtain, upon request by Lender, and in form and substance as may then be satisfactory to Lender, appropriate releases, terminations, discharges, waivers and/or subordinations of any Encumbrances that may affect the Collateral at any time and, at Lender’s option cause same to be filed or registered with the FAA or International Registry as applicable.

32. GRANTOR’S RIGHT TO POSSESSION. Until an Event of Default, Grantor shall have the possession and beneficial use of the Collateral and may use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Related Documents.

33. LENDER’S EXPENDITURES. If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender’s interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor’s failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under

151821345.3

EFTA00011561

EFTA00011562

DocuSign Envelope ID: C9C42BF8-7BCA-4108-A29F-423F14801D14

this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender, on Grantor’s behalf, may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, International Interests, Contracts of Sale, encumbrances and other claims (including the filing of any interest with the FAA or the registration of any interest with the International Registry), at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for inspecting, repairing, operating, insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender’s option, will (i) be payable on demand; (ii) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (a) the terms of any applicable insurance policy; or (b) the remaining term of the Note; or (iii) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note’s maturity. This Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon an Event of Default.

34. DEFAULT. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement:

34.1 Note Default. Any Event of Default under the Note or the Indebtedness.

34.2 Other Defaults. Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement, the Note, the Indebtedness, or the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Grantor.

34.3 Defective Collateralization. This Agreement, the Note, or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected first priority security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason.

34.4 False Statements. Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Grantor or on Grantor’s behalf under the Note, this Aircraft Security Agreement, or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.

34.5 Death or Insolvency. The dissolution or termination of Grantor’s existence (regardless of whether election to continue is made), the death of Grantor (if Grantor is an individual), the death of any member of Grantor or any member withdraws from Grantor (if Grantor is a Limited Liability Company), or any other termination of Grantor’s existence as a going business, the insolvency of Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Grantor’s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Grantor.

34.6 Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings. Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment of any of Grantor’s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its reasonable discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.

34.7 Events Affecting Guarantor. If a Guarantor(s) exists: Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor, endorser, surety, or accommodation party dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness.

34.8 Change in Ownership or Management. If the Grantor is an entity (including without limitation, a partnership, a limited partnership, a limited liability company, or a corporation), any change in ownership or control of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the equity interests of Grantor or any change in the management of Grantor, whether voluntary or involuntary or resulting from the death of an owner or manager of the Grantor.

35. RIGHT TO CURE. If any Event of Default, other than a default on Indebtedness, is curable and if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, has not been given a notice of a similar Event of Default within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, demanding cure of such Event of Default: (1) cure the Event of Default within fifteen (15) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than fifteen (15) days, immediately initiate steps which Lender deems in Lender's sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the Event of Default and thereafter continue and complete all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.

36. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT. If an Event of Default occurs under this Agreement, at any time thereafter, Lender shall have all the rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code and a creditor under the Convention, and Lender shall have and may exercise any or all other rights and remedies it may have available at law, in equity, or otherwise. In addition and without limitation, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies:

36.1 Accelerate Indebtedness. Lender may declare the entire Indebtedness, including any prepayment premium which Grantor would be required to pay, immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to Grantor.

151821345.3

EFTA00011566

DocuSign Envelope ID: C9C42BF8-7BCA-4108-A29F-423F14801D14

36.2 Assemble Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to deliver to Lender all or any portion of the Collateral and any and all certificates of title and other documents relating to the Collateral. Lender may require Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Lender at a place to be designated by Lender. Lender also shall have full power to enter upon the property of Grantor to take possession of and remove the Collateral. If the Collateral contains other goods not covered by this Agreement at the time of repossession, Grantor agrees Lender may take such other goods, provided that Lender makes reasonable efforts to return them to Grantor after repossession.

36.3 Sale of the Collateral. Lender shall have full power to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise deal with the Collateral or proceeds thereof in Lender's own name or that of Grantor. Lender may sell the Collateral at public auction or private sale. Unless the Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Lender will give Grantor, and other persons as required by law, reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or any other disposition of the Collateral is to be made. However, no notice need be provided to any person who, after Event of Default occurs, enters into and authenticates an agreement waiving that person's right to notification of sale. The requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is given at least ten (10) business days before the time of the sale or disposition. All expenses relating to the disposition of the Collateral, including without limitation the expenses of retaking, inspecting, repairing, operating, holding, insuring, preparing for sale and selling the Collateral, shall become a part of the Indebtedness secured by this Agreement and shall be payable on demand, with interest at the Note rate from date of expenditure until repaid.

36.4 Appoint Receiver. Lender shall have the right to have a receiver appointed to take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, with the power to protect and preserve the Collateral, to operate the Collateral preceding foreclosure or sale, and to collect the rents from the Collateral and apply the proceeds, over and above the cost of the receivership, against the Indebtedness. The receiver may serve without bond if permitted by law. Lender's right to the appointment of a receiver shall exist whether or not the apparent value of the Collateral exceeds the Indebtedness by a substantial amount. Employment by Lender shall not disqualify a person from serving as a receiver.

36.5 Obtain Deficiency. If Lender chooses to sell any or all of the Collateral, Lender may obtain a judgment against Grantor for any deficiency remaining on the Indebtedness due to Lender after application of all amounts received from the exercise of the rights provided in this Agreement.

36.6 Election of Remedies. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender's rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement, the Related Documents, or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to

151821345.3

EFTA00011567

take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor’s failure to perform, shall not affect Lender’s right to declare a default and exercise its remedies.

36.7 Convention Remedies. In addition to the remedies previously set forth in this Agreement, Lender has all remedies available to a creditor under the Convention (and Grantor affirmatively agrees that Lender has all the rights and remedies, and can exercise all of the rights and remedies, granted a creditor under the Convention), including but not limited to (a) if Grantor is in possession, custody or control of the Collateral, Lender may enter Grantor’s or any other person’s premises and take possession of such Collateral; (b) to require Grantor to assemble and make available such Collateral at a location selected by Lender; (c) to sell, lease or otherwise dispose or cause the Grantor to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Collateral; (d) collect or receive any income, rents or profits arising from the management or use of the Collateral; and (e) procure the deregistration of the registration of the Aircraft and export of the Aircraft to a jurisdiction of Lender’s choice pursuant to the IDERA.

37. INDEMNIFICATION OF LENDER. Grantor agrees to indemnify, to defend and to save and hold Lender harmless from any and all claims, suits, obligations, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees), demands, liabilities, penalties, fines and forfeitures of any nature whatsoever that may be asserted against or incurred by Lender, its officers, directors, employees, and agents arising out of, relating to, or in any manner occasioned by this Agreement and the exercise of the rights and remedies granted Lender under this Agreement, except in the case of any such claims, losses, or expenses arising out of Lender’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnity provisions shall survive the cancellation of this Agreement as to all matters arising or accruing prior to such cancellation and the foregoing indemnity shall survive in the event that Lender elects to exercise any of the remedies as provided under this Agreement following an Event of Default hereunder.

38. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement:

38.1 Assignment. Lender may transfer or assign all or any part of its interest in this Agreement, together with any Related Documents, and Grantor hereby consents to any and all assignments or sales of, or the granting of participations in, this Agreement and any Related Documents, by Lender and any purchaser or assignee of any interest in this Agreement and any Related Documents.
