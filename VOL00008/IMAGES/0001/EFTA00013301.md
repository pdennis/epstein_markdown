Good afternoon,

Attached is a letter from MDC legal counsel in response to the Court's April 29, 2021 Order (Dkt. 255). Because the MDC is not a party to this case, this letter has not been filed on ECF, but the Government has no objection to the public docketing of this letter.

Respectfully,

Assistant United States Attorney
