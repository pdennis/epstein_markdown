I think the only way we could put on Epstein is if we have it worked out that she is coming here this summer – that would involve her agreement plus full buy-in from and . If that is the case, then the fallout from adding her is minimal because (1) she is in VOC, which is a unit where it makes sense to have an assistant on this case to begin with; and (2) word will get out that she is coming here.
