Dear Jay and Ken:

I communicated your message to Messrs. Acosta and __________. The U.S. Attorney reiterated that he would like me to handle all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein matter, so he does not intend to return your call unless I advise him that neither I nor my Chief in West Palm Beach, __________, is able to answer your question.

If you would like to arrange a conference call with __________ and myself, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
