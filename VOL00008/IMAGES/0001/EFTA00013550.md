Yes. The doctor thinks my recovery is miraculous. I should be back in on Monday, but probably only for a half-day.

I heard you had knee surgery. Hope everything is okay.

I explained to that our grand jury will not have a quorum on April 8th, so if we do not indict on April 1st we have to wait until the 15th.
