Hey

I know you mentioned you'd be at the evidence garage on Wednesday. While you are there, can you check on some of the below items?

Can you find out what the NY Cart numbers are for 1B 53 and 1B 57? I have one number 024329. I'm not sure which one this is associated to and what the other one is.

Also, can you check on 1B 29, 1B 30, and 1B 32 to see if they were processed or are they duplicates? If they are duplicates, which 1B are each of them a duplicate of?

Can you also pull 1B 35, 1B 36, 1B 37, 1B 38, 1B 39, and 1B 40 and see what each of their Cart numbers are?

I will be out next week. I'll be six hours ahead of you timewise, so feel free to call me if there are questions or you'd like to talk through. I cc'd Kelly here as someone who will be in the office if you have questions. I filled her in as well so she should be able to help you if questions arise.
