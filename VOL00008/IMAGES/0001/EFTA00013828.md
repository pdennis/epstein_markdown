Thanks . Believe me, your letter went a long way in ending this. This matter was an object lesson in the nicer you are to people the more they take advantage of your humanity.

. Congratulations to you and your office for fine work. It is nice to see justice being done notwithstanding what you had to endure to get there.

From your standpoint I am pretty confident it is over. Roy Black called me and said: "before you hang up – it's all over with Epstein ... I just need to update things." [redacted] called Roy back who, over course wanted more time but was told that there would be no extensions etc. Although I anticipate some last minute tinkering, since it is now Thursday, it is 50/50 whether they will make our Monday 5:00 pm deadline to plead, be sentenced and surrender. Thanks,

Just as a follow through: Since we sent our letter, it has been complete radio silence from defense counsel. We alerted the AG's office that it was likely that they might try to contact them, and we advised them that they should not take their calls. The AG was advised of the matter. What is the status for you folks? Thanks. [redacted]
