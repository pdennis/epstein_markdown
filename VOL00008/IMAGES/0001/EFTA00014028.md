Subject: Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Messrs. Josefsberg, Edwards, Scarola, Herman, Kuvin, Dutko, and Willits and Ms. Ezell:

Ms. Ezell contacted me to inquire whether Mr. Epstein will be told of the names or addresses of any victims who ask to be added to Mr. Epstein’s “exclusionary zones” on his GPS system. Captain Sleeth from the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office informs me that the information will remain confidential and will not be provided to Mr. Epstein.

Captain Sleeth has asked that all such requests go through me rather than directly to him. If any of your clients would like to have their work, school, or home addresses added to the list of exclusionary zones, please let me know.

Thank you.
