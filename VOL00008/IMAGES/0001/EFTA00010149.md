Hi Wendy,

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for another witness in the Maxwell trial— I expect he’ll testify on 12/9 or 12/10. We would like to have him fly in on the morning of 12/8 and out on the evening of 12/10. Also, just flagging that there is a chance that we will need to change his travel. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much for all of your help!
