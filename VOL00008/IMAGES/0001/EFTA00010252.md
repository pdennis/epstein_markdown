We’ve received some additional documents in this same production we’d like to include in the same general subfolder on Relativity (“BSF second production” under “BSF returns”), please. I’m sending them in a separate folder link so that they don’t mess up your process with the initial results; they’re here:

\\Usa.doi.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\Boies Schiller\2019-04-23. Boies Schiller second subpoena response (follow-up)

Please note there are a few things from that folder that do NOT need to be uploaded – the folder titled “Original Zips” and the two PDF documents (in the main folder) don’t need to go onto Relativity. And I think I neglected to give similar info for the original folder linked to below (“2019-04-18, Boies Schiller second subpoena response”) – in that folder, we do not need the “Original Zips” folder or its contents, and do not need the three PDF documents in the main folder to be uploaded.

As always, please let me know if any questions or issues, and thanks very much.

We can keep the folder structure that currently exists. If I have any questions regarding the documents I will let you know.

Thank you.

Following up on the below, and for the same case – US v. Epstein (USAO # 2018R01618) – could we please load the documents in the following folder into Relativity:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\Boies Schiller\2019-04-18. Boies Schiller second subpoena response

In terms of structure, they can go under the "BSF returns" subfolder (under the folder "Subpoena Returns") under a new subfolder identified as "BSF second production". And under that, we'd like to keep the same folder structure as exists at the link. Does that work?

And I don't believe there is DVD information (as in the "BSF first production" documents), but if there is, please let us know. Please also let me know if any questions or if any other information would be helpful, and if you could let us know when it's all uploaded?

thanks very much,

Hello

The documents would need to be converted to a different format. I will talk to someone about getting the documents converted to a different format.

Thank you.

That's no problem, we don't need those on Relativity. Separately, though will we be able to play those video files *not* on a DVD? That is, we only have them in electronic format (in the file folders) – I haven't tried to play them, so maybe it's just as easy as that, but wanted to check if we need to get them processed in some other fashion to be able to view independently of a DVD player.

thanks,

Good Morning ___________________________________________________________________________________________.

I have noticed that some of these documents contain data that appears to be from a DVD. A DVD contains a bunch of separate files to make everything play on a DVD, but it will not make sense to load DVD information into Relativity. The following should not be loaded to Relativity:

1. \\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\UUUV4Q~3\IFS09L~P\AMUFM~3\S90B8H~H\B3KTU3~5\2MQV99~I\G6WHHA~F\7EJDCF~7\Interview H. R\VIDEO_TS

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.

Could we please load the documents in the following folder into Relativity for US v. Epstein (USAO # 2018R01618):

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\Boies Schiller\2019-03-04. Boies Schiller first subpoena response

In terms of structure, we'd like to create a folder identified as "Subpoena Returns" (at the same level as "FBI Case File" is currently), and in a subfolder within Subpoena Returns, a folder titled "BSF returns," and within that a subfolder identified as "BSF first production" that the docs in the above link can be deposited into (including any additional subfolders). Does that work?

Please let me know if any questions or if any other information would be helpful, and if you could please let us know when it's all uploaded?

thanks very much,
