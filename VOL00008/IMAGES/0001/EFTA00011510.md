Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:

I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.

Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.

At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter as well.

EFTA00011510

MCC New York will provide an update to the Court as soon as the autopsy is completed and the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at [redacted]. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
