Importance: Normal

Attachments: 2019-04-09, JE, sealed memorandum and order re unsealing, 17 Civ 7433.pdf; 2019-04-09, JE, unsealing order (can be shared with BSF).pdf; 2019-04-09, JE, unsealing conference before Judge McMahon, transcript.pdf; 2019-04-09, JE, letter providing additional authority, 17 Civ 0616 (SN) (with exhibit).pdf

Long day today with all this, but ultimately very productive. To the extent any of this is of interest, attached are Judge McMahon's memorandum and order; the separate (shareable) unsealing order; and the very brief transcript of my conference with her earlier today. Also attached is the letter providing additional authority submitted this evening to Judge Netburn in connection with our similar application in her case.
