I heard you had knee surgery. Hope everything is okay.

I explained to [redacted] that our grand jury will not have a quorum on April 8th, so if we do not indict on April 1st we have to wait until the 15th.

Hi all – I am finally home from the hospital. I was wondering whether you have heard anything.

Thank you.
