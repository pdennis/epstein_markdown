Hello ☐ - I just received this from a reporter. It is an indemnification action filed in USVI by Maxwell. It contains statements that are directly contradictory to Maxwell's previous sworn depositions including that Epstein was not assisting in any of her legal bills and she didn't receive anything of value from him etc. and it also references correspondence that she never produced in that case and lists companies that she was apparently employed by.

I am still reviewing but I wanted to get it to you quickly. Looks like ABC is doing a story on it.
