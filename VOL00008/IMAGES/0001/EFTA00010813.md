Hi _________________________________________________________________________

We would like to request approval to travel to Fort Lauderdale tomorrow to interview a victim who has recently come forward. The trip will be a round trip on the same day, so the flight will be the only expense. I think I will be only traveler, but it's possible _________________________________________________________________________ will join as well.

Thanks,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me,

... and/or ... as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and _________________________________________________________________________ or _________________________________________________________________________ and _________________________________________________________________________, but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
