I've attached the bullet points we discussed for today's meeting, which Russell and I are signed off on (the bullet points are pasted below as well). We've also attached a revised version of the two-page memo, which reflects the edits we discussed last night. We did not include language describing what we understood to be the assignment (i.e., cases likely to generate substantial press over the next couple months), on the assumption that would be in your cover note. Thanks.
