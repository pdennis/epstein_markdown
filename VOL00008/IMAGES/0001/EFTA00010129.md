Colleagues,

My office received the attached email as citizen correspondence. Because it references Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, I am forwarding it to you for whatever consideration you deem appropriate. Consistent with our standard response, we will simply advise the writer to contact the FBI. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks very much,
