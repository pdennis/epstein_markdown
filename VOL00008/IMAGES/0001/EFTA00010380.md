Hi [redacted],

We don't have this document -- it sounds like it's an unsealed filing from a civil suit, and those filings are voluminous, so we don't know which document that is (we're not tracking the unsealed documents).

Thanks,

Rather than ask this reporter for a copy of the doc (below), would you happen to have it? Main is asking. Thanks.
