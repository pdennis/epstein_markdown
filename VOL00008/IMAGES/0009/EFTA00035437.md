... This graph is pretty explosive: A person with knowledge of the investigation said that when the decision was made to remove Mr. Epstein from suicide watch, the jail informed the Justice Department that Mr. Epstein would have a cellmate and that a guard "would look into his cell" every 30 minutes.

But that was apparently not done, the person said.

Hi, I know you are busy. Following up on this. Also wondering about a few details I see out there:

was this already known? In addition, the jail had transferred his cellmate and allowed Mr. Epstein to be housed all one in a cell just two weeks after he had been taken off suicide watch, a decision that also violated the jail's normal procedure, two officials said.

Thanks, Lee.

1. When was Epstein taken off suicide watch?
2. How long was he on suicide watch?
3. What unit in the jail was he housed?
4. Was he by himself?
5. What's protocol for watching him at 6:30 in the morning? And in general during a 24 hour period?
6. Is there an internal investigation? Are the guard(s) and/or supervisors placed on modified duty/or some sort of restricted duty while there is an ongoing investigation?
7. Are there surveillance cameras? If so what do they show?
8. What did he use to hang himself?

Pervaiz,

Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.
