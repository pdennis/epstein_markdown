How can she refuse to do work. If she doesn't feel competent enough to do something, she should not be working her... SO we have to teach for her and now we have to do this also...

Will take care of this? Since she saw him for the SRA yesterday, closest to the incident? Seems more relevant for her than I. Do you agree?
