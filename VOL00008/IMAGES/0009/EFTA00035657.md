I am working with IPPA to finalize the press release (1st draft attached). Can you please give me answers to the below:

(1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? No.
(2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his cell? Yes.
(3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-saving measures at the institution? And did EMS drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to the hospital? EMS arrived at the institution and BOP staff along with EMS transported the inmate to the local hospital.
(4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the hospital? No. Epstein was pronounced dead at the local hospital at approximately 7:36 am.
(5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? Yes. FBI was notified.
(6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? July 6, 2019.
(7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex trafficking, but we should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it). Sex Trafficking Conspiracy and Sex Trafficking of Minors.

Thanks,
