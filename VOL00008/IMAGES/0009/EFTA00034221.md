# I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for “The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will show the world your support for women.

Alternatively, Mark Zuckerberg gave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math professors. You can give me a similar award. Lord Robert May of Oxford, former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pólya Prize-winner Anders Björner which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publicly stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer

and you’d have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publicly defending you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Cordially,

D.Phil. (University of Oxford), A.B. summa cum laude (Harvard University)
