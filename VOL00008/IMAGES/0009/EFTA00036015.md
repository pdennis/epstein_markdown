Please provide us the results of your factual accuracy and sensitivity review as soon as possible, but no later than Monday, April 17, 2023. We can accept such comments informally and on a rolling basis.

In this regard, we request that your office maintain a log of who has been provided access to the draft report and when. We also request that your office emphasize to those reviewing the draft report or its contents the prohibition on further dissemination and discussion of the draft report with anyone other than FBI employees, as necessary for the purposes of assessing factual accuracy or sensitivity or preparation of the FBI's formal response.

If you have any questions about this memorandum or the draft report, please contact me or Senior Counsel to the Inspector General . Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
