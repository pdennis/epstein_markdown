# Executive Summary

This analysis, conducted in response to GAO Priority Recommendation 2*, examines the correlation between inmate participation in drug treatment programs and staffing levels from FY2021 to FY2024. This analysis examines (1) the correlation between inmate participation in drug treatment programs and the total number of BOP employees, and (2) the correlation between inmate participation in drug treatment programs and the number of filled FSA positions. Findings reflect correlation only and do not imply causation.

## Key Insights

### Total Number of BOP Employees

- No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates participating in all drug treatment programs.
- No correlation between the total number of BOP employees and the number of inmates participating in individual drug treatment programs.**

There is no trend indicating that changes in the number of BOP employees affect inmate participation in drug treatment programs.

### Number of Filled FSA Positions

- No correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of inmates participating in the Drug Education Program, RDAP, or Community Treatment programs.
- Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the total number of inmates participating in all drug treatment programs.
- Moderate correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of inmates participating in NRDAP.
- Strong correlation between the number of filled FSA positions and the number of inmates participating in the MAT Program.

This indicates that increases in filled FSA positions are generally associated with higher inmate participation in certain drug treatment programs, though other factors may also play a role.

*GAO Priority Recommendation 2: "The Director of BOP should develop and implement a plan for analyzing data to help identify and address the causes and potential impacts of staffing challenges on staff and inmates"

**Individual drug treatment programs include the following: Drug Education Program, RDAP, NRDAP, Community Treatment Program, and MAT Program.
