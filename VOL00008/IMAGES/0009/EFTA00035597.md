Hi

I contacted Associate Warden who is cc'd on this email, and she will be able to provide any information that you need. If you need anything else, please let me know.

Hi DAD

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.
