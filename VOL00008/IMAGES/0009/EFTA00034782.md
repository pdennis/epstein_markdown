Subject: Fwd: RE: Update on the Epstein attorney visiting log jam?

Please see the below email chain regarding the SHU attorney conference room issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Peggy Cross-Goldenberg &lt; 7/30/2019 4:28 PM &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,

Just to note one additional wrinkle that is easily solved:

Today, it sounds like our staff observed that Epstein's lawyers were able to hold onto the SHU room even after they had met with him while they waited to meet with him again. No one else gets that privilege. If a client has to be taken back to the unit, or to medical, or otherwise leave the attorney visiting area, we would have to leave, too. If he needs to be taken to another location, and his attorneys want to meet with him again, the facility can require them to get back in line like the rest of us.

Today alone we had one attorney give up after waiting in the lobby for 2.5 hours. We had another attorney wait for three hours. That included a wait of an hour and fifteen minutes "after" he got to the SHU room while Epstein was brought "back" to the room his lawyers had been holding and while medical visited him there regarding some paperwork for his fish allergy.

We have attorneys who urgently need to see clients this week. We urgently need a solution.

Thanks,
Peggy

Thanks for getting back to us, Just a heads up that we will likely file something with Judge Rakoff in Sayoc. Our attorneys have not been able to meet with him, and his sentencing is coming up. If there's some alternative, please let me know.

&gt; Hi Jennifer,
&gt;
&gt; I have no update yet. I am hoping to have a workable solution soon, but am awaiting decisions of administrators.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Hi [Redacted],
&gt;
&gt; I just got an email from a very frustrated lawyer who waited 2.5 hours and was ultimately unable to see a client housed in SHU.
&gt;
&gt; Any update on this issue?
&gt;
