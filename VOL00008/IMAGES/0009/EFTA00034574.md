Based on instructions by my agency's counsel and attorneys for the Department of Justice, I conducted a search for documents which may be responsive to the documents requested in the INMATE DEATH legal and as outlined in the legal hold distributed by counsel on Aug 14 2019 (see attached lit hold notice). These documents are known as "potentially responsive documents".

I will not move or copy any files at this time. I acknowledge that I should not destroy, discard, alter, or make inaccessible any potentially responsive documents. If I discover any potentially responsive documents have been altered or destroyed, for whatever reason, I will immediately contact agency counsel. In the event that I leave the agency or change positions within the agency, I will work with my supervisor and agency counsel to make sure that any potentially responsive documents continue to be retained.
