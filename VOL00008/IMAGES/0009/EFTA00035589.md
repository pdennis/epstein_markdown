Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with _________________________ who indicated that most likely he will be found competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who indicated they observed inmate Epstein with a makeshift noose around his neck. Therefore, he will be pending a UDC hearing. Should he return to SHU, he will be housed with inmate _________________________. Inmate _________________________ is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general population.

The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however, inmate _________________________ and _________________________ were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, _________________________ releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell mate of inmate _________________________.

We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate.

If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by [REDACTED]. Chief Psychologist. He will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

**DEFINITION**: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate [REDACTED]. Inmate [REDACTED] pleaded guilty in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because he requested Protective Custody.

Thanks. Where and with who will he be housed after his Attorney visit? Also, what does "Psychology Observation" status mean?

Hello,

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney. I will provide you with information concerning the medical assessment, once I receive it. Thanks.
