MEMORANDUM FOR ROCCO LUPO, FOOD SERVICE ADMINISTRATOR

FROM: [REDACTED], Cook Supervisor

SUBJECT: Authorization to Feed Meals in the Attorney Conference Room

On Saturday July 20, 2019 food service received a phone call from the Lt. Office extension asking that a regular Styrofoam tray be sent up to attorney conference for inmate Epstein, who was in attorney conference at the time. The caller, which was identified as Lt. [REDACTED], was notified by myself that inmate Epstein does not receive a regular meal, he receives a common fare meal, and his meal was sent to his unit which was 9S. Lt. [REDACTED] stated that inmate Epstein was to be feed in attorney conference. I then contacted 9S and let them know that Lt. [REDACTED] needed for inmate Epstein’s common fare to be sent to attorney conference. I also notified cook supervisor Smith on July 23, 2019 that inmate Epstein was being feed in attorney conference when he is there, as per the information that I received from the Lt.
