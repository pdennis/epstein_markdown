Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter.
