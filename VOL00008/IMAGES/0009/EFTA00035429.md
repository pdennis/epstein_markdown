Dear Mr. Epstein:

I am writing to express my condolences to you regarding the passing of your brother, Jeffrey Edward Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019.

On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was pronounced deceased at the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. At this time, although there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death, it appears to be the result of suicide.

Although I realize that words alone cannot lessen your sorrow, I hope that my thoughts and sincerest sympathy will be of some comfort to you.

Sincerely,

Warden

MCC New York
