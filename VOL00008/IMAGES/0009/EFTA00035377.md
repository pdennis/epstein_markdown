**Synopsis:** On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter.

**Medical Assessment:** The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the Physician Assistant and his findings were as follows:

He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical encounter. Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on his neck. Responded: "I don't know".

He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck.

He does not look in any distress or pain.

Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this erythema in the front with marks of friction.

The memo is very confusing. Please draft an email of his actions and current status. Also include what plans were in motion to move him to a GP unit. It will need to be something I can forward to IPPA and the Director. Sent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone
