Thank you.

But how can I find out if Jeffrey Epstein was on suicide watch while he was in your custody?

Hi there –
I understand officials may have given a statement yesterday on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein was

on suicide watch.

Are you able to confirm whether or not he was or might you have a statement regarding the issue that you sent to others?

I appreciate it, on behalf of CBS News.
