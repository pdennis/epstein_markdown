Good afternoon,

Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch.

There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our building and in front of the court house which is less than 100 yards apart from each other.

If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me.

Thank you
