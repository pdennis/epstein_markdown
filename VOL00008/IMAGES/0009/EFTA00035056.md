Daily Activity as communicated or documented by the Operations Lieutenant for August 01, 2019, was received and/or reviewed. The following information was noted.

## Morning Watch Shift:

Lt. [REDACTED] reported food slots on unit 5-South unsecured. Numerous food slots were unable to be secured, due to, hinge malfunction or inmates stuffing locking mechanism with paper/plastic spoons. This is an ongoing problem, which has been reported previously via email upon being discovered on various other units. Open food slots presents a grave safety and security risk to staff operating the housing units especially on Morning Watch when we have a limited amount of staff available to respond to emergencies and no medical personnel.
