which is why i just went back at [REDACTED] on it - i'm sure you heard me

How can she refuse to do work. If she doesn't feel competent enough to do something, she should not be working her...
SO we have to teach for her and now we have to do this also...

: Please see attached and below from [REDACTED] and Lt. [REDACTED]. It seems more relevant for you to do this report since
you saw him yesterday for the SRA.

Will [REDACTED] take care of this? Since she saw him for the SRA yesterday, closest to the incident? Seems more relevant for her
than I. Do you agree?
