Good afternoon _________________________

My apologies, but I was at the courthouse most of the day. We are currently looking into this. Have any attorneys reported delays with getting their SHU clients? I just want to have all the information for MCC administrators to review.

Thank you,

Good morning _________________________,

I've received some complaints about the Epstein legal team taking over the SHU room for entire days.

Given that visiting rooms are already in short supply, is there some plan to accommodate the increased demand so that other attorneys with SHU inmates also have access?
