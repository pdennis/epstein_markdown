Warden

Thank you for supporting our scheduling of the Psychological Reconstruction for inmate Epstein. I will be joined by [redacted], Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Region.

I am attaching a list of materials we will use to complete the reconstruction. We routinely take these documents with us so please ensure you have a copy of any documents you also need. Your assistance in gathering these documents is appreciated and will be helpful.

Organizing and facilitating staff interviews often takes the most time and I am requesting the assistance of an assigned staff member. In the past, wardens commonly have someone from the SIS department or a lieutenant available throughout the reconstruction for this purpose and to track down additional documents as needed.

As discussed we will be staying at the Sheraton Tribeca on 370 Canal Street and appreciate your arranging travel to the institution. We will be ready for pickup at 0715 on Tuesday morning and expect to complete the reconstruction by close of business on Thursday.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thanks,

Rob
