SUBJECT: Security Camera Monthly Report - Institution

Effective June 1, 2024, a monthly reporting process will be implemented at all Institutions. The report will be implemented collaboratively between the Administration Division – Facilities Management Branch and Correctional Programs Division – Correctional Services Branch. A sample of the report template is attached for your reference.

The procedure for completing the report is as follows:

The Electronics Technicians at each Institution will prepare a monthly security report that has a template input into the Facilities Management Computerized Maintenance Management System. The report lists the total number of installed cameras, any adjustments to the camera count that may have been made, the cameras' recording capability, the operational state of the cameras and recording devices, and any repairs that were made to cameras during the month. Each Institution's Captain and Facility Manager will examine the report to ensure that the information is complete and accurate. The Security Camera Report will be input into the Facilities Management Monthly Report to the Region and submitted from the Warden to the Regional Director.

Should you have any questions on this matter, please contact [REDACTED] Chief, Facilities Management Branch at [REDACTED]
