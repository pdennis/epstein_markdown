CONFIDENTIAL

I said I should e-mail you regarding inmate Epstein.

I did not have the Staff SW Log when I interviewed him today. I found the log in mailbox and when I reviewed them it noted that he told staff watching him that his cellmate tried to kill him and that he was trying to remember what happened. I was not able to ask him about this because he was in legal all afternoon and is still there now.
