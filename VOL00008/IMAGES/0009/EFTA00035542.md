not even just the ineffectiveness of not sending the e-mail herself, but she's obvi avoiding delegating this to [redacted] b/c she's scared to tell her. [redacted] just declined to do it. saying she doesn't know if he was competent b/c he claims he doesn't recall the incident. she said she will get torn up on the stand and lose her license if called in to testify about her SRA from yesterday and a disciplinary report. so [redacted] then told me again to do it. anyway, looks like he would need it b/c he's not a CC3 or a study so [redacted] said she just replied to it. [redacted] saying he's competent and that should be sufficient. smart move of K2

yeah, she does stuff like that all the time. it's so annoying. i just ignore her. she doesn't seem to get how inefficient it is to send an email to someone to tell them to send an email to someone else lol. makes no sense. even K2 has noticed it, and told me how [redacted] always sends her all these unnecessary emails, and how she has started to try to email her first, letting her know she already received things or already knows things, so that [redacted] doesn't have to tell her again or forward her emails she already has lol

look what i just sent you about epstein - why does [redacted] tell me to send it to [redacted]? shouldn't this be her job as boss?
