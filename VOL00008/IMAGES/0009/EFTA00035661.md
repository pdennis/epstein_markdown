Good morning,

This is just a follow-up to our conversation this morning concerning Epstein, Jeffrey, Register No. 76318-054, who was found unresponsive in his cell at 6:33 a.m. Life-saving measures were performed by institution staff and EMS staff. He was escorted to the local hospital where he was later pronounced dead at 7:36 a.m. Should you require any additional information, please contact me. Thanks.
