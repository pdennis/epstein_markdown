I KEEP TELLING YOU PEOPLE THAT THE MEDICATION YOU GIVE ME DOESN'T WORK, THAT IT GIVES ME MIGRAINES AND MAKES MY MOUTH TASTE LIKE METAL. YOU KEEP TELLING DR. [REDACTED] WHAT TO GIVE ME, WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW YOU DECIDE WHAT I TAKE IF YOU DON'T SEE ME AND YOU DON'T TALK TO ME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM GOING THROUGH BUT YOU DECIDE WHAT MEDICINE I GET, I HOPE YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH THE NEGLIGENCE OF EPSTEIN AND I HOPE YOU ARE ONE OF THE PEOPLE FIRED YOU DESERVE IT, I DON'T SEE HOW YOU EVEN HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL YOURSELF A DOCTOR.
