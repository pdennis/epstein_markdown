totally. i wonder if  was embarrassed/introspective seeing a response like that. this is b/c of epstein. he was on SW but in regular clothes on legal visit and questioned it. i told  when she asked that we have done it this way in the past. in light of the huge scar on epstein's neck (granted a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident), he did need to be on SW yesterday. i guess we should have declined his legal visit if we were following this other chief's advice

lol i love this guy's response. that if this is even a question, they probably shouldn't even be on watch. we put way too many people on there. i'm even seeing the difference in BRO. they just don't function that way. guys come here from MCC and go to SHU, and tell staff they want to go on SW, and the staff laugh at them, and the inmates tell them they were able to get on watch that way at MCC. and the psych who responded to her is at Chicago, another detention center. so, I'm guessing they see a lot of the same things that we do, and probably use SW less as an option.
