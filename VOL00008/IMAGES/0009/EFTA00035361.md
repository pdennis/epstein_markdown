The attached PDF is the final version that I will now send to all the reporters who contacted OPA (about 50 so far).

will have MCC NY send this PDF to media who contacted MCC NY.

The MS Word will not be released externally, but is provided to OLA in case helpful to them to have language for possible Member inquiries next week by email, etc.

Thanks,
