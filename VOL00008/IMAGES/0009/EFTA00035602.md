Good morning all,

Epstein's attorneys are trying to get him his CPAP machine per our request. Can we have them hand-deliver it to medical staff as we have in previous instances?

Thank you,

Is Mr. Epstein approved to receive a CPAP machine? If so, should we send it directly to him through the inmate mail system? Please confirm.

Thank you.
