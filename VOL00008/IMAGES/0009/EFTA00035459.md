Importance: Normal

This is concerning as this media venue is the one that has been relentless with BRO and MCC in the past.

Hi there,

I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from defense attorneys, current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to respond.

Regards

Aviva Stahl

- that some cells in the facility are covered in mold
- that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for prisoners to take showers at a reasonable temperature
- that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They "be lucky if they were treated like dirt under somebody else's shoe, but they're not even treated that well," said one lawyer
- that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility ("whether its people who are suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need spiritual guidance or religious accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get warehoused there - all of that is lacking.")
- that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women's floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to clean up the feces themselves
