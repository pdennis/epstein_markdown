Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Judge Berman:

I am writing in regards to your August 12, 2019 inquiry whether the investigations referenced in my August 10, 2019 letter will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23, 2019.

I can confirm that, although an internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23, 2019 incident, the current investigations by the FBI and OIG will include this incident as well. Accordingly, I cannot divulge any information about the prior investigation at this time.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call me at [redacted].

Sincerely,

Warden
MCC New York
