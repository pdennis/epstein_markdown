As I was doing the 10:00 PM count, I notice this inmate distraught, sad and a little confused. I asked him if he was ok? he said, "that he's ok." but I am not convinced because he seems dazed and withdrawn. So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him. I don't know the inmate register number because he is new, he is currently on 5 North. I don't know who did his in take, so I am not familiar with any information on this inmate.
