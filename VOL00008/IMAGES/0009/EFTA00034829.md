Hello,

I am here and will be able to provide any information you need. Warden [REDACTED] is on annual leave this week and I am acting on his behalf. I did provide all the information that we have to [REDACTED] on July 24, 2019, who passed on the information to her superiors. Thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; " (USMS)" &lt; [REDACTED] &gt; 7/25/2019 11:33 AM &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi DAD [REDACTED]

There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.
