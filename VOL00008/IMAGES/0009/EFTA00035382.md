Hello,

Inmate Epstein #76318-054 was removed from Suicide Watch and stepped down to Psychological Observation. He was just escorted to Health Services for a follow-up assessment/evaluation. Once completed, he will be escorted to Attorney Conference to meet with his Attorney. I will provide you with information concerning the medical assessment, once I receive it. Thanks.
