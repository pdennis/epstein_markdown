Here is the game plan:

The Com Tech's are currently un-boxing the new hardware and getting the equipment in the new racks. Need power and network drops and IP Addresses to the new racks. Need to make sure the existing coax jumpers from the old recorders will reach the new racks for cutover between old equipment and new.

Jeff McKenzie from SigNet will be on site Monday. He will be sending NCIC forms.

The old system will run continuing to record the existing remaining channels until the new system is ready for cutover. First priority is to restore recording to all channels. Redundancy/PTZ control etc. will be converted once recording is restored.

The existing analog matrix switch will remain for PTZ control and PLC camera call up.

I will provide an update once we are on-site and assess current site conditions.
