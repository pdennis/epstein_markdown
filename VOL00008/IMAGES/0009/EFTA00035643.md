Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there again. I wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs rather than keeping him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that way when he is interviewed today. I will be in touch this morning.
