Good afternoon all,

Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that his CPAP is plugged in?

I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 days has elapsed?

Thank you,

Good afternoon

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best,

Mariel Colon Miro, Esq.
