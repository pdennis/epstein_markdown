He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner.

Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-mail to Mr. [redacted] about the toilet.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.

He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse [redacted] saw him.

He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse [redacted].

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

Thanks,
