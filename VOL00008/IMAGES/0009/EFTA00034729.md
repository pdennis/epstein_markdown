The National Suicide Prevention Coordinator from Central Office, [Redacted], contacted me today about Epstein. He thought that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a good idea. I told him I would speak with the executive staff about his suggestion. Also, [Redacted] thought it wise that we keep him down here for a bit (as is the plan already).

I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call my cell phone [Redacted]. Thank you.
