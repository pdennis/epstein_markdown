Hello,

I don't have your telephone number; however, I wanted to inform you that inmate Epstein was moved from Psychological Observation to the Special Housing Unit. He appeared before the Unit Discipline Committee for an incident report for Self-Mutilation. He is now pending a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Officer. Please give me a call if you need any additional information. Thanks.
