# NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM
## SUICIDE RECONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
(6-30-2015)

The following is a list of requirements, resources and documentation needed to conduct a thorough reconstruction. It is also important to have one person identified who will coordinate documentation collection, interview scheduling, and serve as a contact person for the reconstruction team. Typically, this person would be the SIA. Having the following items collected in a tabulated binder will expedite the review process and ensure that relevant data is examined. Please remember that not all items will be available or applicable to every case.

**A copy of this binder will be a permanent record that leaves with the reconstruction team.**
