No worries about tomorrow. Take care of your business. I knew he didn't tell you because I was receiving calls and they said they tried to reach him and he wouldn't answer. But it's ok. I'll deal with it. Yesterday was a ghost town as well. said it was 13 vacant posts. Please ensure the staff in SHU make the rounds or get assistance with the rounds. Maybe Activities. Not only due to Epstein but one of the reasons. If any non-custody come in, please use them. I'm here if you need me. Thanks.

Good morning Ma'am I was on staff assist all week at Danbury so I had no idea that he designated me this weekend so I'm really sorry about that. I'll help out as soon as I'm done with tomorrow and take care of things on Tuesday so you won't have to worry about anything.

FYI, we are on modified status today. Staff search, Internal, 5 south, 7 south, SHU 3 and 4, are vacated. We are doing attorney visits though but we may have to cancel religious services. Enjoy your Sunday...

Good morning,

No worries. He designated you as the Captain this weekend and I am sure you weren't aware of it. I got all the calls. He's not answering the phone so I'm sure you won't get a response. I will deal with things tomorrow. and both also have a lot going on. We will be fine. Thank you.
