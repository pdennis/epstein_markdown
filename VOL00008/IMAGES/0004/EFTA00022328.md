Hey ,

I know you're traveling, but when you get a chance, could you please let me know if you ever received a subpoena return for the attached AT&amp;T subpoena? I'm working on checking all GJ and court subpoena returns, and I've found a few other returns for two other AT&amp;T court subpoenas, though not this one. Please let me know when you can, thank you!
