Hey — I'm prepping a disc to go out to MDC today with the materials stamped last night. I've attached the two cover letters for MDC — if you don't have any edits, I'll convert to PDF and send the disc to MDC today. Thanks!

— sorry one small thing, can you just list the documents in the index in the letter as “Spreadsheets” not FBI Spreadsheets? Thanks!

Updated PDF attached, thanks! I can upload to USAfx after you share the correspondence with them. If you have no objections, I'll share the production with the same people we did last time . Should take only a few minutes to upload. Thanks!

Thanks so much, Can you please update the bates range in the first paragraph and then send me a PDF of the letter? Can you please remove the word "discovery" from the title of the PDF? Are you able to share with the defense via USAfx?

Sorry for the night email, but we need to send out the spreadsheets sent us to the defense tonight. Are you able to get them in a production and stamp them? I'll circulate a discovery letter.

Thanks!
