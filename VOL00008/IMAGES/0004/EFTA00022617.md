I don't think we've done update memos for Geoff and since February. Those are attached. We have since done shorter update memos for the DAG, most recently in May.

Would you mind sending us the final version of the most recent update memos on these investigations? I know in some cases they were part of a larger memo. I don't think we have the final draft in some instances.

All –

Geoff has to brief the AG on various cases next week, to potentially include . As of now we do not need to do memos for the AG, but Geoff would like fairly meaty briefing memos on these matters. Some of them you have already done, so they can be supplemented/revised as appropriate – find one of us to discuss or answer any questions. We would like them from you by Wednesday if possible so that we can get them to Geoff by Thursday night or Friday. That sound okay?
