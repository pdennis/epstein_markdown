That’s great, thanks — and Jenna is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I take it we’ll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we’re talking about a meeting with the client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I’ll circle back in timing, and will also send you a copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon.

Two other quick things — first, we know your client as [redacted] but I think you mentioned her name has changed? Could you please let me know her current last name?

And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it’s something we don’t need to talk to her directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it.

thanks,

Hi there,

Sorry for the delay on our end. Robbie is going to be out of town, but Alex Hess (cc’d here) and I, and our colleague Jenna Dabbs (former member of your office), would love to do a proffer with you tomorrow or Friday. We can do it by phone or in person, but would prefer to do it in person.

On Thursday, we are available from 9 to 11AM or after 4PM. On Friday, we are available any time after 11AM.

What works best for you?

Thanks!
