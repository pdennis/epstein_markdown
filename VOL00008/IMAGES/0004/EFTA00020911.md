Hello and

During our call you explained that you were actively trying to investigate crimes in France by Jean Luc Brunel and had reached out to certain government officials in the US to try to coordinate your efforts but had not received any substantive communication or assistance. I explained that there is a great team of prosecutors in New York who have been actively working on this investigation. Per our call I am copying above . As I explained, I am not sure if they can directly be of help to you but they will likely have a better sense of who within the US government you can be coordinating with.

I hope this is helpful and thank you for your pursuit of justice in France.

Best,
Sigrid
