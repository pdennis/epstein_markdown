Hi [REDACTED].

I hope all's well! Attached is a draft of our RTC in the Maxwell case. If you have time to look at it, we'd love any comments you might have.

In terms of timing, we have to file a joint proposed RTC on October 27, so we are thinking of sending this to the defense a week or so before that.

Thanks,
