This is belated (just now finally working through emails from yesterday) but thank you – I really do appreciate it. It's been a crazy process but we're off to a good start. Thanks again for emailing – and congrats again on your trial win, and welcome back to regular life – and let's catch up one of these days, been too long.

Dude, congratulations on the Epstein case. I can't imagine a worthier one and I'm sure it was exhausting and difficult to put together. You really did an unbelievable job.
