Hi [REDACTED],

Hope you're doing well! Would it be possible to get a hard drive of all of the returns you've received for the Epstein case? I know you've given me them on discs, but we were hoping to get them all on one drive to make sure we have a complete set in one place.

Not sure if you're in the office, but I will be this week. No worries if you need some time to get it to us. We can also get you a hard drive if necessary.

Thanks,

[REDACTED]
