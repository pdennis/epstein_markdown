Hi , would a more targeted request for 1 month of the 5 years of records - the month of the two wires - result in Reid/myself reviewing these records prior to Monday's hearing?
And if you could give us the names of the recipients of the two wires that too would help
Thanks
Marty

Hi Marty,

We do expect to produce them as part of Rule 16 discovery. I expect we may reference financial information in connection with filings as necessary appropriate, as we did in Friday's submission, but we'll of course provide the full materials to you as discovery.

thanks,

, we request a copy of the records obtained from Institution 1. We would request that they be provided as discovery and not as part of a public filing. Let me know if you consent to that production.
Otherwise enjoy your weekend
Marty

To the Chambers of Judge Berman:

With apologies for the delay, attached please find a courtesy copy of the Government's reply in support of its detention memo and in opposition to the defendant's motion for bail, including exhibits, filed this afternoon in the above-captioned case. Defense counsel is copied.

I hope everyone has a good weekend.
