So massaging her chest is as explicit as it gets? What about her complaint?

&gt; She was skilled in massage. Yeah.

&gt; Mike Baker
&gt; And she eventually relents.

&gt; But I had never had a professional massage before. So I didn't know what really was involved in that. And so she said that I would take off my clothes and lay under the sheet.

&gt; Ghislaine performs the massage.

&gt; She had me, you know, flip over to my back. And then she pulled the sheet down so that my breasts were exposed.

&gt; Mike Baker
&gt; And she remembers how Ghislaine then went on to massage her chest.

&gt; Like it just - this feels weird. This feels uncomfortable. I don't think this is probably right, but I don't know.

&gt; Mike Baker
&gt; And all this time, she's struggling to figure out what's going on. Jeffery Epstein, she says, wasn't participating in the massage. But she has this sense that he's in the area, that the doors are open, it's kind of an open area where she's getting the massage.

&gt; I could feel his presence, like, oh, I'm sure he can see me from where he is.
