OCME asked whether we could send them a copy of the redacted autopsy report. Could you please send me a copy of it on Friday so I can forward to them? Thank you!

I spoke with the GC of OCME, who appreciated the head's up. One note for you all: the photo of the hyoid bone on page 12 is in fact Epstein's hyoid bone. To the extent we're redacting the closeup photos from page 13, shouldn't we also redact the entire photo on page 12?

Thanks,
