The Maxwell team would like to send a “friendly subpoena” to real estate attorney who handled the purchase of Maxwell’s New Hampshire property in 2019. reached out to the FBI following Maxwell’s arrest and offered her assistance. She requested via email the formality of a subpoena before providing us non-privileged documents from her file. As such, we do not need PSEU’s approval, but we do need approval to issue the subpoena. The proposed subpoena is attached to this email. In short, we are seeking any non-privileged documents and records regarding the purchase of Maxwell’s New Hampshire property. These records are relevant to our ongoing investigation into Maxwell’s finances, including any financial ties to Epstein and any efforts Epstein may have made to buy Maxwell’s silence.

Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.

Thanks,
