A Durable Power of Attorney is an important legal document. By Signing this Durable Power of Attorney, I am authorizing another person (my "Agent") to act for me. I acknowledge these important facts:

- My agent (notary public) has no duty to act unless my agent and I agree otherwise in writing.
- The power I give my agent will continue to exist until I revoke it, or until my death. You may continue to rely on this Power of Attorney until you receive written notification of my revocation or death.
- The powers I give my agent will continue to exist even if I can no longer make my own decisions respecting the management of my property.
- I can amend or change this durable Power of Attorney only by executing a new Durable Power of Attorney or by executing an amendment through the same formalities as an original. I have the right to revoke or terminate this durable Power of Attorney at any time, so long as I am competent.
- This durable Power of Attorney must be dated and must be acknowledged before a notary public.

| --- | --- |
|  N | PLEDGE AGREEMENT  |
|   | I agree that this account is an account under The General Terms for Accounts and Services and is pledged as collateral for all of my obligations and is subject to the security interest provisions in The General Terms for Accounts and Services, the terms of which are incorporated by reference, The General Terms for Accounts and Services together with this application are the security agreement under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as amended from time to time.  |

|  Q | LINKING AGREEMENT | I'll pay no monthly fee, provided that I maintain the combined average monthly balances with JPMorgan Private Bank as listed on my current fee schedule.
By linking my multiple no-interest bearing Checking accounts, I can use the combined account balances to avoid or minimize interest charges incurred due to an overdraft in any one or more of the linked accounts. Note that linking can reduce or eliminate interest charges due to overdrafts, but does not prevent the overdrafts themselves. Each day, the collected balances in all linked accounts are added together. If the net balance is negative, overdraft interest charges will be calculated on that negative balance.
I understand that linking Checking Accounts as described above may have legal, tax or other ramifications under applicable U.S. or other laws or rules (owing to, for example, different legal entities owning linked accounts and incurring or paying charges on behalf of each other or having their assets offset against each other's). By signing below, I represent that I and the other account owners have consulted with my legal, financial, tax or other advisers on these matters, accept the linkage so created, and will manage the accounts to prevent any negative repercussions. I agree to hold harmless from and indemnify JPMorgan Private Bank and each of its affiliates, officers, directors, agents and other representatives against any liability relating in any way to its provision of account linking services to myself or the owners of the linked Checking Accounts. Other terms applicable to my Accounts are contained in The General Terms for Accounts and Services, Account Agreements, and Appendices.  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  P | MORGAN AGREEMENT | The General Terms for Accounts and Services and Appendices along with this Application, including the Linking Agreement, the Checking Account Agreement, the Money Market Investment Account Agreement, and any additional Account Agreements, Rate and Fee Schedules, Appendices and Supplemental Forms, and all amendments and supplements to any of them in effect from time to time comprise the Agreement between you and me.
By signing this Application, I acknowledge that I have, or will read all the various documents, including but not limited to, the General Terms for Accounts and Services, Account Agreements, Rate and Fee Schedules, and Appendices, and Supplemental Forms which comprise the Agreement between you and me ("Agreement"). I further acknowledge that I will notify you immediately if I have any issues with the Agreement. Otherwise, I will be deemed to concur with this Agreement between you and me. I also agree that each of the Accounts I am applying for is pledged as Collateral for all of my obligations. I also acknowledge that I have read and consent to the terms of the JPMorgan Private Bank Privacy Policy, including the manner in which my information is received and used and that upon opening an account with JPMorgan Private Bank my client information will be used by one or more members of the JPMorgan Private Bank family of companies (as listed in the Policy) in order to make available to me all the products and services available through the JPMorgan Private Bank. I understand that you do not give tax or legal advice, and that I am advised to consult a lawyer or tax advisor about tax, legal, and estate-planning issues affecting my Accounts, including the way Accounts are titled.  |
|  Q | IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION | A FOREIGN PERSON MAY HAVE TO COMPLETE IRS FORM W-8BEN OR FORM W-8IMY. A "FOREIGN PERSON" MEANS A NONRESIDENT ALIEN INDIVIDUAL, A FOREIGN CORPORATION, A FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP, A FOREIGN TRUST, A FOREIGN ESTATE, AND ANY OTHER PERSON THAT IS NOT AN U.S. PERSON.
