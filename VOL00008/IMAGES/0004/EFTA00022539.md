A week after being denied bail, Jeffrey E. Epstein was found unconscious in his cell on Tuesday at a federal jail in Manhattan with marks on his neck, and prison officials were treating the incident as a possible suicide attempt, a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the matter said.

Mr. Epstein’s injuries were not serious, said the official, who requested his name not be published because he was not authorized to speak on the matter. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to requests for information.
