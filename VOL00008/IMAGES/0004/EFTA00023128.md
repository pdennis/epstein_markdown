John,

Thanks again for chatting earlier today regarding your representation of Mr. . As I mentioned on the phone, we appreciate his cooperation with our investigation thus far, and we do expect we likely would call him as a witness at a Maxwell trial. In the interim, please do not hesitate to be in touch with us if any questions or issues arise, and as you mentioned, it would be helpful if you could please let us know if he receives any subpoenas or other legal process or relevant requests.

As promised, we also want you to have contact info for our full team – my colleagues and are copied here, and we're all reachable any time at these email addresses or at the following phone numbers:
