NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. **Purchase Price; Payment.** Seller agrees to sell, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Aircraft for a total purchase price of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,800,000) (the "Purchase Price"), which shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller as follows:

(a) Purchaser shall wire transfer a deposit in the amount of One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $100,000.00) (the "Deposit") to AIC Title Service, LLC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), which Deposit shall be held in escrow and disbursed at the Closing (as hereinafter defined and described) pursuant to the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement; and

(b) The balance of the Purchase Price in the amount of One Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$1,700,000) (the "Purchase Price Balance") shall be paid at the Closing, said Purchase Price Balance to be wire transferred (as and when provided in Section 4(c) thereof) prior to the Closing into the Special Escrow Account (as defined below) of the Escrow Agent for its disbursement to Seller at the Closing upon the satisfaction of the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement.

1.1 **Establishment of Special Escrow Account.** The Deposit has been wire transferred to the general escrow account of the Escrow Agent maintained at JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., 100 N. Broadway Avenue, Suite 401, Oklahoma City, OK 73102. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly cause the Deposit to be transferred to, and maintained in, a special escrow account at said Bank created and maintained solely and exclusively for the

EFTA00022696

purpose of this transaction (the "Special Escrow Account"); and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon provide Seller and Purchaser with the number of the Special Escrow Account and any other information pertinent thereto. The Deposit shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent in the Special Escrow Account, and shall be refundable to Purchaser unless the same becomes nonrefundable in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not place or hold any funds in the Special Escrow Account except for the funds received in connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance).

## 2. Condition of the Aircraft.

(a) At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an airworthy condition, subject, however, to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with a valid FAA standard airworthiness certificate, (d) subject to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with all airworthiness systems functioning in normal working order in accordance with the manufacturer's Operations Manual, (e) in compliance with the mandatory portions of all FAA airworthiness directives and mandatory service bulletins that have been issued with respect to the Aircraft with due dates on or prior to closing, (f) with all applicable remaining manufacturer's and/or vendor's warranties duly assigned by Seller to Purchaser, provided that such warranties are assignable and that any cost of assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in "Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements.

## 3. Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(a) Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FBO facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(b) The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution

(d) The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

(e) During the Pre-Purchase Inspection, Purchaser shall be entitled, to conduct an initial flight test of no more than sixty (60) minutes in duration to be flown by the Seller's pilots with

EFTA00022697

up to three (3) representatives of Purchaser accompanying the flight. All procedures to be adopted during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance occurring during said flight test, those that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller during said flight test, subject, however, at all times to the discretion of the chief pilot who shall have absolute operational discretion and control over the Aircraft.

(f) Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the Aircraft by not later than five (5) business days following the completion of the Pre-Purchase Inspection and the issuance of a written inspection report from the Purchaser’s agent (the "Inspection Report"), copies of which shall be made available to the Seller. Any difference, discrepancy or defect in the Aircraft from any of the Delivery Condition requirements in Section 2 hereof that cause the Aircraft not to be in airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a “Discrepancy”. The Inspection Report shall note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy so noted. At Purchaser’s discretion, Purchaser shall accept the Aircraft in its “as-is”, “where-is” and “with all faults” condition (“Unconditional Acceptance”), or reject the Aircraft (“Rejection”). Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft shall be evidenced by Purchaser’s issuance to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of a Certificate of Technical Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the “Certificate of Technical Acceptance”). If there are one or more Discrepancies which cause Purchaser in its discretion to issue a Rejection, then, within such three (3) business day period, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, written notice of Purchaser’s termination of this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereof (a “Termination Notice”).

(g) If Purchaser timely issues a Termination Notice in accordance with Section 3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof.

(h) If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 hereof, and the parties shall proceed with Closing as hereinafter provided.

## 4. Closing and Delivery

(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place three (3) business days after: (i) Purchaser’s delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (iv) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than April 20, 2021 (the "Closing Date").
