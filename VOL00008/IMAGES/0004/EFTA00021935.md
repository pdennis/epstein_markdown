Great. Thanks for the quick turnaround on this.

Also, I think I flagged this on the call but just to be clear, [redacted] would like to take a look at the current versions of the declarations tomorrow. He knows about the new docs and that there may be changes based on them, but I think just wants a sense of what the declarations will be. So if you can send me wherever the draft is tomorrow so I can pass along to him that'd be great—but no need to incorporate changes based on the new docs if that's not possible by tomorrow. Thanks.
