Sure. I am around the rest of the afternoon today. Tomorrow is a bit rougher, but I could talk first thing (like 9) or late afternoon.

Brendan,

An attorney for an individual who has an active civil case in connection with Epstein has reached out to us to ask if we know the current counsel for [redacted]. I assume that the attorney is seeking to serve a request or subpoena for documents and/or testimony, though we haven't asked specifically.

I don't think we ordinarily engage on that type of question, but given that we have been in touch with you in connection with our interview of [redacted] if you'd like we can pass along your contact info, so that the attorney goes to you rather than attempting to contact or serve [redacted] directly. And if not, of course no problem, and we'll just let him know that we're not able to comment one way or the other on the status of any counsel. Whatever you prefer.

Thanks, and hope you're well these days.
