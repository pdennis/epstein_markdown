Hey ,

Sounds good on those names. We will get this done after pushing out the 3500.

In looking at the FedEx documents we are pretty confident that they were never produced in discovery. I've downloaded and stamped them, and drafted a cover letter (attached). Should these materials be stamped with the same text that sent previously ("SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17")? If so, I'll add it to each of them.

There are also a number of additional materials that are saved in a pending production folder here:
\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Discovery\GM\27 Eighteenth Production (2021-07-xx)

Are these materials good to be stamped as well or should we just produce the FedEx materials and wait on the rest?

Thanks,

From: "(USANYS)" &lt;&gt;

Hi paralegals extraordinaire,

Do you have a few minutes to speak about a project we were hoping you could work on for Maxwell? I'm pretty flexible Wednesday and Thursday if you guys want to confer and let me know some times that work for you for a call.

Thanks!
