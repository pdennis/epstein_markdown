Sorry guys, I'm having bad tech issues today. Attached is the draft letter re 23.1, which is far rougher than I'd hoped to get it. I should free back up in an hour or so, at which point I can turn back to this if there's still more to do on it.

Sorry guys I can't. I keep getting kicked off the vpn, and I'm fighting with my computer, so I haven't been able to do nearly as much work as I had planned this afternoon.

So I obviously had to do this pretty quickly today, and it doesn't help that Westlaw has been down all afternoon, but one way or the other we gotta get something filed. Does either of you have a moment to take a look at this in the next hour or so?  I'm sorry, I know you have something at 2:00! If the answer is no, totally understand, I can just pass it up to  and  Thanks either way and talk soon.
