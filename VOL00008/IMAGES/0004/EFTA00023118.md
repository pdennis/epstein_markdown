Good morning Bobbi-

I apologize for the delay in response, however, I will inquire with the appropriate staff regarding both of your concerns.

Best,

Good evening-

I am still awaiting a reply to yesterday's email regarding Ms. Maxwell's legal mail.

There are items that need to be picked up by the MDC.

I have provided the tracking information.

Please provide a response by 10:00 am tomorrow Wednesday.

Thank you-

Bobbi

&gt; Good evening -
&gt; During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting room that I have been required
&gt; to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room.
&gt; Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers’ claim
&gt; the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner room.
&gt; I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room.
&gt; The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid.
&gt;
&gt; Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below.
&gt; Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries.
&gt; Thank you-
&gt; Bobbi
