Hi,

I'm sorry I didn't answer sooner, but this went to my old email address &amp; had to be routed to me. Aero Records was purchased in June by AIC Title Service LLC, and several of us are here at AIC now. My new information is below. (New email, address, phones, etc...)

We can definitely take care of this for you. I will hold on to the name change copy that you emailed to us, and we need you to also send FAA Form 8050-1, the Application for Aircraft Registration, for each of the aircraft, showing the new company name. We will submit the name change document, with the application forms, to the FAA, and they will issue new certificates to you, under the new name, about a month following the filing of the documents. Our fees are $79 each aircraft, plus $5 to the FAA (total of $84 each aircraft). You can send us a check in the amount of $168., along with the documents, or give us a credit card to bill – whichever is easiest for you.

If you have not received our information regarding the re-registration of all aircraft that will soon begin taking place at FAA, just let me know, and I will get that information to you, via email. Aircraft certificates will need to be renewed every three years, and our company has the ability to track these for clients.

Just let me know if you need me to mail the Application for Registration forms to you, or answer any other questions.

Thank you,

Lisa

I would you please authorize me to put the Fed-Ex fees on your mastercard that we used for the FAA transaction?
(Or, if you have a fed-ex acct. number, I can use that. But, you'll need to get it to me pretty quickly...)
Thanks!
