1) The agents think that [REDACTED] is in Florida. They told me they'll plan to approach him the next time we're in Florida, whenever that happens.

2) The agents are in touch with [REDACTED]. He is cooperative but would like a subpoena (which I'll issue). He has boxes of case files that he does not think the FBI ever collected, and he has agreed to provide them to us when/if we meet with him (in Florida).

3) I asked the agents for more information about the envelopes of cash in Epstein's safe marked [REDACTED]. They'll get back to us.
