Marty,

Thank you. Regarding discovery, we expect to make an initial production no later than Tuesday, and we expect it will be electronic discovery in native format -- that is, PDFs, JPEGs, etc. (in other words, not .tiff and load files as is sometimes the case).

thanks,

I am in receipt of your earlier email about preservation/production and will have a responsive letter to you no later than Monday morning (hopefully today or over weekend).

- can you advise us as to when we will receive the initial discovery subject to the now issued Protective Order and to the extent it is an electronic production, its format so that we can have Steptoe IT prepare for its receipt.

Thanks

Marty

Martin G. Weinberg, Esq.
