## Dividend and interest income earned

For purposes of this statement, taxability of interest and dividend income has been determined from a US tax reporting perspective. Based upon the residence of the account holder, account type, or product type, some interest and/or dividend payments may not be subject to United States (US) and/or Puerto Rico (PR) income taxes. The client monthly statement is not intended to be used and cannot be relied upon for tax purposes. Clients should refer to the applicable tax reporting forms they receive from UBS annually, such as the Forms 1099 and the Forms 480, for tax reporting information. It is the practice of UBS to file the applicable tax reporting forms with the US Internal Revenue Service and PR Treasury Department, and in such forms accurately classify dividends and/or interest as tax exempt or taxable income. Please consult your individual tax preparer.

# Realized gains and losses

The estimated realized gains and losses shown below are not for tax purposes. Please note that gain or loss recognized on the sale or redemption of certain Structured Products, like Contingent Debt Securities, may be ordinary, and not capital, gain or loss. Please check with your tax advisor. To calculate gains and losses, we liquidate the oldest security lot first. This is known as the first-in, first-out or FIFO accounting method. We use this method unless you specified which tax lot to close when you placed your order. This is known as a versus purchases or VSP order. See important information about your statement at the end of this document for more information. We may not adjust gains and losses for all capital changes. We automatically adjust cost basis for tax-exempt and AMT coupon municipal securities for estimated amortization of bond premiums and for accreted OID for securities issued at a discount. If you requested that UBS adjust cost basis for the bond premium amortization on taxable debt securities then cost basis reflected for these securities has been adjusted. Estimates in the Unclassified section can not be classified as short term or long term because information is missing, or the product is one in which the gain/loss calculation is not provided.
