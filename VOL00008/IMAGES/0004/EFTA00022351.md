# What the Papers Say

Most headlines are leading with Prince Andrew and his involvement in the Epstein inquiry. *Telegraph* writes “In the latest twist in the saga concerning Prince Andrew’s links to the billionaire paedophile, the Duke’s legal team insisted he had offered to speak to the US authorities

"on at least three occasions this year". Revealing the Department of Justice (DoJ) had confirmed that the Duke "is not and never has been a target of their criminal investigations into Epstein", the statement by Blackfords law firm accused US prosecutors of "seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered." The Daily Mail say 'In challenging the veracity of America's Department of Justice, which has accused him of refusing to cooperate with its investigation into Epstein's sex-trafficking network, he is taking on the most powerful law agency in the world. And in a further twist last night, U.S. authorities responded to the Prince's intervention. In a statement, the Justice Department said Andrew had sought to 'falsely portray' himself as a willing participant in their inquiry and said he had 'repeatedly declined' to be interviewed. In other news, The Times leads with the toppling of the Colston statue by antiracism protestors. "The home secretary had a 'firm' conversation yesterday with Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset, and demanded an explanation for what had happened in Bristol on Sunday. She made clear that she expected those who pulled the statue down to face criminal prosecution. There have been no arrests so far". The Guardian says "Conservative group leader, Mark Weston, who called it "a wanton act". Bristol's mayor, Marvin Rees, the son of a Jamaican migrant, said that although the statue had been an "affront" throughout his life, he could not "condone criminal damage". "But at the time, several of those present told the Guardian, the mood was not vandalistic but righteous. After all, more formal attempts to bring about the figure's removal had become so bogged down that even an attempt to affix a new plaque to better reflect Colston's history had been delayed indefinitely".

The FT writes, "more than half of Boris Johnson's cabinet are pushing for Downing Street to cut the two-metre social distancing rule to contain coronavirus, in a move that would provide a huge boost to the hospitality industry". City A.M. reports, "Tory MPs have blasted Huawei's UK media blitz as a "ridiculous" attempt to gain British sympathy, amid increasing pressure for Boris Johnson to cut ties with the Chinese technology firm. In an open letter to the British public Huawei today emphasised its commitment to the UK over the past two decades and its credibility as a telecoms provider. 'For nearly 20 years, we've supplied the UK's mobile and broadband companies with 3G and 4G. But some now question our role in helping Britain lead the way in 5G,' it said". The Independent, says, "Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing that it was still "our current working plan" that they will not reopen until September "at the earliest". "On Tuesday, Boris Johnson will speak to his Cabinet before the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, delivers a statement to Parliament on the wider reopening of schools".

According to The Times, "Boris Johnson has been urged to offer all Hong Kong residents the right to live in the UK to show that Britain is

"serious" about its obligations to the territory. The prime minister, who has promised to give three million Hong Kong citizens extended visa-free access, was told by senior Tories that he should allow them to remain permanently.
