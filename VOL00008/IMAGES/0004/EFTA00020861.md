Attached are both cover letters. I also overlooked the most recent JPMorgan production that we received:

[REDACTED]

Luckily, it's much smaller than the previous productions we've received and can thus be re-stamped manually. Let me know if you'd like me to do so for this production.

Thanks, would you send me a cover letter for each, please?

Thank you both so much! Would you please send me a draft cover letter?

Once you get the [REDACTED] straightened out, please let me know.

Also, how are the replacement files for Maxwell's MDC drive coming?

Hi all,

All the materials have been stamped and are ready to go. A big shout out to [redacted] for a great job on her first stamping project. We went ahead and stamped the two [redacted] productions that are not password locked. The other two we still have to figure out how to open. I've been in contact with [redacted] who has one of the productions that we need. The first files he sent over were corrupted; I'm hoping that the second time is the charm.

Ah got it, sorry I was confused. That plan for marking is fine with me, thanks.

Hey [redacted]

I believe what [redacted] meant was that we would still be producing everything in the folder but would only stamp select files; in doing so we'd be avoiding the filler and supporting files which don't contain any viewable data.. My thinking is that we stamp only the folders and leave the files as they are since the structure and contents of the folder are already confusing as is. On something like this, defense will be leaning entirely on the manual that is included for viewing. I fear that if we were to alter file names it would greatly complicate the process of figuring out how to work the files.

Thanks,

Hi [redacted]

Thanks very much for working through this. My preference is to produce everything where possible. Is it possible to produce the entirety of the files and app related to LSJ Scene2Go? We are trying to produce everything we can.

Thanks,

Subject: Fourth Production - Scene2Go

Hi all,

I'm bates stamping files within the Fourth Production folder, and one of the items we're going to produce is called "LSJ Scene2Go." From what I gather, this is an application for viewing 3D maps – in this case, there's a 3D view of the grotto and the main structure. When not viewed in the Scene2Go app itself, you can view screenshots of the 3D maps, and I'm assuming these images are what we want to produce.

For your reference, here are the files pertaining to the grotto (

and those pertaining to the main structure (

In each location,

the "map" and "scans" folders contain the viewable files. Within the map folder is an aerial view, and within the scans folder are essentially screenshots of the 3D view of the landscapes. Each view is saved 7 different times, each increasing in size. For the sake of easy review, I think that only the largest (and highest quality) images should be stamped, instead of stamping every duplicate.

This looks similar to the issues we faced with the Second Production, as the vast majority of files within the larger Scene2Go folder are system- or application-generated files that simply accompany the files (in this case, scans and maps of the grotto and the main structure) that are actually viewable and of interest. I'm thinking it would be best to just stamp these viewable files, along with the Scene2Go user manual (for context), but of course I wanted to run this by you all first. I'll defer to your better judgement!

I'm happy to talk this over further as well – thank you so much!
