We have a fairly quiet week ahead, presumably because of the holiday. Depending on what we learn at Monday's briefing, we may have some work to do to deal with this drone exercise (although if Eric's information is correct, it really should be an inconvenience but not something that requires radical adjustments.)

- I am contemplating who should take [redacted] place in organizing the trial training program (with Karl) that all new AUSAs do, and welcome any thoughts in that regard. This is not time sensitive, but better to think about it ahead of time.
