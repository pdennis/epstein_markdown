I know that [redacted] asked you about scheduling a meeting on the church fraud case for next week. It would be good to schedule that – I think he is aiming for end of week.

Check with the Securities chiefs about a time for meetings on [redacted] (2 separate cases). [redacted] is ripe for early next week; [redacted] late.

[redacted] may want to have a check-in meeting with the Epstein team. He gets regular email updates, but he might want to just talk about status of things.

Are there any meetings I should try to get on the calendar for next week or even this afternoon? Thanks!
