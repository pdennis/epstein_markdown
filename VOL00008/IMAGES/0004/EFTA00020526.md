Subject: Re: Maxwell drive delivery Monday 1/11

Just wanted to give you a heads up that Maxwell will receive the hard drives tomorrow. Our paralegal who logs them was out yesterday and had an a lot of discovery drives to log today. By the time he went to deliver hers, she was already on her VTC and won't be off until 3:30 and he will no longer be here.

Good afternoon,

The FBI has very kindly agreed to deliver two new drives from my office to the MDC for Ghislaine Maxwell on Monday, January 11th. I've cc'd Special Agent , who will be coordinating the delivery. Would you please let us know what time the FBI should plan to make the delivery and who will be available to receive the drives on Monday?

Thank you all very much for your help.

Best,
