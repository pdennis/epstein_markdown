Mike,

I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to know, for example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide any additional information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect our determination regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to call [redacted] to ask her a number of questions we would expect to argue to the court do not implicate a fifth amendment privilege—i.e., that she couldn't simply blanket invoke. Would it be useful to discuss via phone?

thanks,

Dear Counsel:

I met with [redacted] and I need time to evaluate matters. Regarding the subpoena to testify before the Grand Jury on [redacted], we hereby notify you that if called as a witness [redacted] would invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Please let me know if you will require her to invoke in person or whether this communication suffices and no appertaining will be required.

Yours truly,

Michael Bachner
