Yes. I told him he’s need to get legal advice from his general counsel (or whoever), I appealed to him more on the ethics side of it. And told him about the secrecy of grand juries, which he was fuzzy on.

This sounds like he’s trying to get protection from legal liability or legal advice he should be getting from counsel, not us, doesn’t it?

Many thanks. Can you please let me know if there is a specific legal barrier to me naming any of the alleged victims given that (a) they are no longer minors and (b) that at least two of them have waived anonymity in the past to speak out as survivors of Epstein's abuse?
