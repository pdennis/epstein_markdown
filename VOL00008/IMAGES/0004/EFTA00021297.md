Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Ms. Hutner:

By letter dated August 28, 2019, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO”) requested that the OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party (i) “any documents, evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or the FBI—including documents, records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within the OCME case file that include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI”; and (ii) “the names and identifying information of any federal law enforcement agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the substance of any statements or interviews made by those agents or employees” (the “August 28 Letter”).

At OCME’s request, the USAO has made proposed redactions to the version of the OCME report and file for Jeffrey Epstein that was previously provided by OCME to the FBI, consistent with the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter. That redacted document is attached hereto. For the reasons set forth in the August 28 Letter, we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party any photographs of the scene at the MCC. Finally, in order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation, in addition to the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter, we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party this letter and its attachment, and the August 28 Letter. We appreciate your willingness to comply with these requests. Please contact us with any further questions.

Very truly yours,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
