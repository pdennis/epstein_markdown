Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

Today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02775032 through SDNY_GM_02775072.

Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as “confidential,” because it includes information regarding records designated as “confidential” under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word “confidential” in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: “SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17.” This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today’s production.

An index of the materials contained in this production is below:
