Hope you're both doing well. Following up on our last conversation, we wanted to send along a few documents in order to facilitate our conversation about identifying an appropriate witness from JP Morgan. Attached is a zip file containing a few draft exhibits. We are still working on finalizing exhibits, but we thought it made sense to start the conversation about this sooner rather than later. Please let us know if you have any questions or if a call would be useful.

Thanks,
