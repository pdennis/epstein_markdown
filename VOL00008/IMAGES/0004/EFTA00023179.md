I unfortunately am in another meeting at 3:30 today, but feel free to go ahead without me.

☐ Not sure if you had talked to ☐ about this, but after the news reports, ☐ and I were trying to do some additional digging to see if there was a way that we could reopen this investigation given that some of the conduct seems to have touched on New York.

Thanks,

Either of those times work for me. ☐ and I have a meeting at 2 so 3:30 would be better if possible.

All,

We’ve been able to gather some information on the Jeff Epstein matter and I’d suggest we have a call to determine the way forward. Does 3:00 or 3:30 today work?
