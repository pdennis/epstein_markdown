Re: Case Number 2018R01618 and Court Docket Number 19-CR-00490

Dear Gloria Allred:

The enclosed information is provided by the United States Department of Justice Victim Notification System (VNS). As a victim witness professional, my role is to assist you with information and services during the prosecution of this case. You have been designated to receive notifications on behalf of the following victim(s) (or potential victims) identified by law enforcement during the investigation of the case:

On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in custody at the Manhattan Correctional Center. Where a defendant dies prior to conviction, this Department of Justice will, in the ordinary course, seek dismissal of the pending indictment. However, as the U.S. Attorney has publicly stated, the investigation of the conduct charged in the Indictment remains ongoing and we continue to urge anyone who feels they may be a victim or have information related to the conduct in this case to please contact 1-800-CALL-FBI.

Sincerely,

Geoffrey Berman
United States Attorney

Wendy Olsen
Victim Witness Coordinator
