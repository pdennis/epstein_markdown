Chiefs,

Attached is Maxwell's memorandum in support of her renewed bail application. She attached a number of exhibits, which are too large to send in a single email. I've saved the full submission with exhibits and with the defense's proposed redacted versions of its filings on the share here: [Redacted]

Let me know if you would like me to email any of the other parts of the submission to you.

Thanks,
