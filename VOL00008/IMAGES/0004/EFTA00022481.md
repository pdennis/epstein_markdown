[redacted] and [redacted], thanks for all you and the team did to get this done well and timely.

As you know only the non-recused memo should be passed along to Geoff.
Thanks for all your help.

Here are the two memos for your briefing with Ed of the DAG, one from Geoff and the other from me on the recusal matters.
After you and I spoke, we realized that we should add Epstein and we have done so.
As always, please feel free to call with any comments or questions.
