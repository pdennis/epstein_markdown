Reid,

No problem, and we can chat later this week at the hearing and then meet when that makes sense. In the interim we'll start work on some general discovery and also on a draft protective order.

thanks,

So in a word I am eager to sit down with you guys to figure out if there is any way forward at all to find common ground in this nightmare...a combination of demanding judges in other cases and an unexpected potential conflict has tied me in knots today...sorry...and I am on the west coast the rest of the week...obviously this is not going anywhere soon so hopefully we can find time when I get back...again sorry for the false starts...reid

Marty, Reid,

Briefly following up on this morning, if you could please let us know what if any information you're able to provide about the passport we discussed, with the copies we provided to you, we can address any new info as appropriate for a possible submission tomorrow.

Related, something I'm not sure we've specifically asked, and I'm not sure whether pretrial asked—can you please advise whether Mr. Epstein currently is, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States?

thanks,
