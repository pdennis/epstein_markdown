Embedded: RE: _Mailing_and_Laptop.msg

I apologize for the confusion. I did not know that the defense planned to file their letter in advance, and they did not ask us for input before filing. Judge Nathan endorsed the order within less than 24 hours without allowing time for any response. To be very clear, my office has never filed any response to the defense motion. The defense represented in their letter what I have said repeatedly to them and you, which is that my office has no objection to Maxwell accessing the laptop on weekends.

I am sorry that Judge Nathan ruled before you had the opportunity to inform us that you wished to respond to the defense letter. Given that you did not tell me that you wanted to respond when I sent you the defense letter, I did not realize that you intended to object. (I have attached the only response I received from you after I sent you the defense letter, which makes no indication of any intent to file an objection.) Had I realized, I would have notified the Court.

We will, of course, file whatever letter you wish to submit with Judge Nathan, and we are always happy to discuss if that would be useful. We remain very grateful for all of your assistance.

Best,

We were informed after our afternoon meeting of the order. While we will be complying with the order this weekend, we will be filing a letter requesting the order be vacated. Judge Nathan's order states "the unobserved to order." I explicitly stated that MDC was objection and denying this however you failed to represent that to the court it seems. While I understand you do not work at the institution, and you may not understand the hardships this may cause, ii do expect that you would understand it is setting precedent that causes many serious concerns and hardships for the institution, myself, and all the other staff.

Good evening,

In disregard of the Court's order, the team leader of Ms. Maxwell's security detail informed Ms. Maxwell that she will not have access to the laptop on Saturday. (See email below.)

I will be notifying Judge Nathan of MDC's blatant disregard of the Court's order. Perhaps this will move the Court to direct Warden to appear and face questions concerning the mistreatment of Ms. Maxwell and misconduct by his staff.

Any assistance you can provide to effect compliance with the order so that Ms. Maxwell has access to the laptop over this long holiday weekend is greatly appreciated. Thank you. Enjoy the long weekend.

Bobbi

To: BRO/Exec Assistant-

Earlier today I forwarded a copy of the court order directing MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell with access to her laptop on weekends and holidays. (See email and Order below).

At 3:40 pm, Officer [redacted] told Ms. Maxwell she 'will not be getting the laptop on Saturday.'

Ms. Maxwell informed Officer [redacted] that access to the laptop has been court ordered, to which Officer Regan replied "I don't care."

Be advised: Judge Nathan will be informed of the explicit violation of the Court's order. I urge the MDC to immediately comply with the order or face contempt of court.
