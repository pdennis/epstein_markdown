Dear Counsel:

In recognition of the Government's ongoing discovery obligations, today we are producing copies of the materials listed in the below index, which materials are stamped with control numbers SDNY GM 00328070 through SDNY_GM_00356148.

Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case.¹ This letter is itself designated as “confidential,” because it includes information regarding records designated as “confidential” under the Protective Order. An index of the materials contained in this production is below:
