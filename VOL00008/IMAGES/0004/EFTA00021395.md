Good morning, Mola Lenghi with CBS News here. Hoping to confirm a report we're seeing out there. Not sure if you can.

"Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Jeffrey Epstein's longtime person pilots as investigators seek to question the financier's employees in the wake of his indictment on sex-trafficking charges."

Confirmation?

Thanks for considering.
