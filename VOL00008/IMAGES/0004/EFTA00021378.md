My laptop isn’t letting me connect to the network this morning, but my plan is to review as soon as that’s fixed (which should be in about 30 minutes).

Thanks, ☐. Has anyone started to review this yet? I’m tied up for a bit if someone else has a chance to look

All,

Attached is the most recent draft of the NPA brief. Apologies for the delay, I really struggled with this one. I think our arguments in the first half are strong, but I'm really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your comments/edits. I've also flagged a few issues for consideration/discussion. If you're able to review tomorrow morning, that would be great.

Thanks,
