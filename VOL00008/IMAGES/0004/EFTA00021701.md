As a heads up (re [redacted]), I think the flight records we have only go back to December 1997 (when [redacted] is 17). We don't have any flight records before that date. I'm going to call the lawyer who represents Larry Visoski (the pilot) to ask if records from the 90s exist anywhere, but we may be out of luck.

The flight records do reflect a 5/3/98 flight from PBI to good old Teterboro, and [redacted] Maxwell, and Epstein are on the manifest. [redacted] was 17 at the time of the flight.
