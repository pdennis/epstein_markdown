Hi all—

Let us know what works best from you on the FBI side. Do you want to call my desk when you're together? On our end, we have another call at 2, but I don't expect this will take too long.

Thanks,

I’ve CC’d the forensic accountant [REDACTED] in our squad who will be assisting in this investigation. Let’s try and plan a day next week to meet briefly and discuss a game plan. Are you guys around Tuesday to chat?

[REDACTED]

Tomorrow morning could you please burn the following folders to [REDACTED] disc:

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY
investigation\Subpoena Returns\American Express

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY
investigation\Subpoena Returns\Deutsche Bank

and put the disc in an envelope addressed to:

Special Agent [REDACTED]
Detective [REDACTED]

If it’s possible to get the disc by 11:30, we’ll give the disc to [REDACTED] at the conference, or if not, if you could put the envelope with security and reply all that it’s ready, they can pick up when convenient.

thanks,
