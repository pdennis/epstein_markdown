So I obviously had to do this pretty quickly today, and it doesn't help that Westlaw has been down all afternoon, but one way or the other we gotta get something filed. Does either of you have a moment to take a look at this in the next hour or so? I'm sorry, I know you have something at 2:00! If the answer is no, totally understand, I can just pass it up to and . Thanks either way and talk soon.
