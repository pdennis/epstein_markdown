AUSA

Chief, Public Corruption

USAO-SDNY

Following are some numbers you requested.

1. Total number of email files obtained for the 5 subjects → approximately 516,000.

This does not count attachments (e.g., correspondence, drafts, final documents, press report, etc.) as separate files.

Note that for subjects who left the USAO during the pendency of the Epstein case, there are fewer, and that the line AUSA (who remained involved with the CVRA litigation until mid-2019) accounts for the vast majority of the files.

2. It is our best ballpark estimate that we determined approximately 3,000 unique emails were directly relevant to OPR's investigation, but we certainly considered a larger universe.

3. Our best (most useful) collection of scanned-in USAO hard copy documents is from the CVRA litigation, and includes both the production to petitioners (3,754 pages), and a separate collection of privileged documents/records (about 15,267 pages) that were submitted to the court (and that remained privileged). We also have hundreds of pages of other case documents in both hard copy format and electronically, but they are largely duplicative of these two sets and are difficult to quantify.

We hope this is helpful.
