Subject: RE: Interviews - 10/22 and 10/23
Date: Tue, 15 Oct 2019 14:33:41 +0000

Hello _______ – sorry for the delay but I have been trying to get a handle on who is coming for the meeting etc.

__________ is a victim that I think will be helpful to your continuing investigation. She is working hard with your victims’ coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US then we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22nd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will probably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the interview (from 2-4).

__________ is going to be attending the meeting and she said she could interview with you right after the meeting. I believe the notice says the meeting starts at 10:00 on October 23rd so maybe we plan to meet you at 12:00 depending on the length of the victims’ meeting.

__________ also wanted to come to the meeting. I know you met with her for a short while. If you would like to meet with her for a more detailed interview we could do that on the afternoon of October 22nd from 4 – 6 if that works.

__________ is _______ She would like to try to attend via skype or some kind of conference line. I know you interviewed her sister _______. If you would like to also interview _______ I can set something up.

Let me know if that works.
Best,
Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

Hope you're doing well. [REDACTED] mentioned that some of your clients might be interested in being interviewed while they are in New York on 10/22 and 10/23. We'd be happy to get times on the calendar. Would you please let us know who would be available for interviews and what dates and times work for each client?
