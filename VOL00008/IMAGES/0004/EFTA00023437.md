Hi

We have produced all FAA records. Most of the password-locked files were duplicates of the certified files, so we just produced the certified ones. Only a few of the remaining password-locked files were not duplicates, so I ended up printing, scanning, and stamping them, and including them with that production. So, overall, we are all set, and all the records were produced. Thanks for checking in!

Hi

Just checking in on this thread. Are there still FAA records that we can't unlock and haven't produced? If so, we should just include them in the next production and stamp them whatever way we can.

Thanks,

Hi

It appears that external mail size constraints are preventing me from sending you the files that are password-protected. The file names are below:

- 188TH-Airworthiness
- 188TH-Registration
- 550GP-Registration
- N550GP was N212JE was N415LM registration
- N550GP was N212JE was N415LM registration
- N722JE registration

When attempting to edit the PDFs – which all appear to be registration files – we are prompted to enter passwords. These are not the complete set of password-protected documents, but these are the documents that we need to be able to print/edit as soon as possible.

I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have for me. Thanks very much for any and all help you can provide us!

Hi!
Can you let me know which files were password protected?
I don't believe I password protected any of them.

Hi [Redacted].

Thank you very much for this information and for the quick turnaround. We really appreciate it.

Do you happen to know the password on the PDF documents you sent us? We'd like to stamp them for discovery purposes, but they are password-protected.

We're still reviewing your email and these documents, but will certainly be back in touch if we have follow up questions.

Thanks,

2007 Gulfstream GV-SP (G550), serial number 5173 was assigned tail number N415LM in March 2017 and was registered to
Chevron USA Inc., Oakland, CA. Per a bill of sale dated March 29, 2017, Chevron USA Inc sold Gulfstream N415LM to;
Plan D LLC
[Redacted]
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgins Islands
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager
I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. [Redacted] he is a pilot
I don't see EPSTEIN's name on any of the FAA paperwork.
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN.
It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction.
[https://insuredaircraft.com/]
Per the Plan D LLC, statement in support of registering aircraft that was submitted to the FAA, Jeffrey E. EPSTEIN was a member
and VISOSKI was the manager. Further, Plan D LLC was established in 2012 in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Per a request to the FAA dated August 07, 2017 from VISOSKI, they requested to change the tail number from N415LM to N212JE.
In January 2018 they changed the tail number to N212JE. VISOSKI provided phone number [Redacted] and e-mail: [Redacted]
On August 14, 2019 I was told that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and was in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia.

EFTA00023439

Flight plans indicated N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it operated from Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK).

Per a bill of sale dated December 22, 2020, Lawrence VISOSKI on behalf of Plan D LLC "sold" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC who "sold" it the same day to N550GP LLC in Ontario, CA. N212JE was registered on February 24, 2021 to N550GP and [redacted] signed as manager of Frontier JV LLC, its member.

in March 2021, they changed the tail number to N550GP and it's still registered as N550GP to N550GP LLC.

It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled this transaction also.

I attached a picture of N212JE.
