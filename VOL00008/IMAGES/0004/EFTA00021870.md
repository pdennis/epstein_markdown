Ghislaine Maxwell,

Defendant.

20-CR-330 (AJN)

ORDER

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Defense has moved for an order “prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements concerning this case.” Dkt. No. 27 at 1.

The Court firmly expects that counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this Court’s local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant’s motion without prejudice. But the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant’s right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.

SO ORDERED.

Dated: July 23, 2020
New York, New York
