## RECITATIONS:

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller desires to sell, transfer, and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, one used 2008 Keystone (Sikorsky) model S-76C++ helicopter, bearing manufacturer’s serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) as N722JE, together with said aircraft’s two (2) Turbomeca S.A. model Arriel 2S2 engines bearing Manufacturer’s Serial Nos. 42285TE and 42286TEC, and with all avionics, equipment systems, furnishings and accessories installed on, contained in or attached to said aircraft and engines, all as is more particularly described on Exhibit A, and also including all airframe, engine and accessory logbooks, flight and operation manuals, maintenance and overhaul records, and all other records and paperwork relating to the above-described aircraft and engines in Seller’s possession (collectively, the “Aircraft”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. **Purchase Price; Payment.** Seller agrees to sell, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Aircraft for a total purchase price of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,800,000) (the "Purchase Price"), which shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller as follows:

(a) Purchaser shall wire transfer a deposit in the amount of One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $100,000.00) (the "Deposit") to AIC Title Service, LLC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), which Deposit shall be held in escrow and disbursed at the Closing (as hereinafter defined and described) pursuant to the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement; and

(b) The balance of the Purchase Price in the amount of One Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$1,700,000) (the "Purchase Price Balance") shall be paid at the Closing, said Purchase Price Balance to be wire transferred (as and when provided in Section 4(c) hereof) prior to the Closing into the Special Escrow Account (as defined below) of the Escrow Agent for its disbursement to Seller at the Closing upon the satisfaction of the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement.

1.1 **Establishment of Special Escrow Account.** The Deposit has been wire transferred to the general escrow account of the Escrow Agent maintained at JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., 100 N. Broadway Avenue, Suite 401, Oklahoma City, OK 73102. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly cause the Deposit to be transferred to, and maintained in, a special escrow account at said Bank created and maintained solely and exclusively for the

EFTA00022872

purpose of this transaction (the "Special Escrow Account"); and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon provide Seller and Purchaser with the number of the Special Escrow Account and any other information pertinent thereto. The Deposit shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent in the Special Escrow Account, and shall be refundable to Purchaser unless the same becomes nonrefundable in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not place or hold any funds in the Special Escrow Account except for the funds received in connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance).

## 2. Condition of the Aircraft.

(a) At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an airworthy condition, subject, however, to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with a valid FAA standard airworthiness certificate, (d) subject to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with all airworthiness systems functioning in normal working order in accordance with the manufacturer's Operations Manual, (e) in compliance with the mandatory portions of all FAA airworthiness directives and mandatory service bulletins that have been issued with respect to the Aircraft with due dates on or prior to closing, (f) with all applicable remaining manufacturer's and/or vendor's warranties duly assigned by Seller to Purchaser, provided that such warranties are assignable and that any cost of assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in "Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements.

## 3. Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(a) Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FBO facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(b) The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution

(d) The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

(e) During the Pre-Purchase Inspection, Purchaser shall be entitled, to conduct an initial flight test of no more than sixty (60) minutes in duration to be flown by the Seller's pilots with

EFTA00022873

up to three (3) representatives of Purchaser accompanying the flight. All procedures to be adopted during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance occurring during said flight test, those that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller during said flight test, subject, however, at all times to the discretion of the chief pilot who shall have absolute operational discretion and control over the Aircraft.

(f) Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the Aircraft by not later than five (5) business days following the completion of the Pre-Purchase Inspection and the issuance of a written inspection report from the Purchaser’s agent (the "Inspection Report"), copies of which shall be made available to the Seller. Any difference, discrepancy or defect in the Aircraft from any of the Delivery Condition requirements in Section 2 hereof that cause the Aircraft not to be in airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a “Discrepancy”. The Inspection Report shall note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy so noted. At Purchaser’s discretion, Purchaser shall accept the Aircraft in its “as-is”, “where-is” and “with all faults” condition (“Unconditional Acceptance”), or reject the Aircraft (“Rejection”). Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft shall be evidenced by Purchaser’s issuance to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of a Certificate of Technical Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the “Certificate of Technical Acceptance”). If there are one or more Discrepancies which cause Purchaser in its discretion to issue a Rejection, then, within such three (3) business day period, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, written notice of Purchaser’s termination of this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereof (a “Termination Notice”).

(g) If Purchaser timely issues a Termination Notice in accordance with Section 3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) thereof.

(h) If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 thereof, and the parties shall proceed with Closing as hereinafter provided.

## 4. Closing and Delivery.

(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place three (3) business days after: (i) Purchaser’s delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with Sections 3(f) and (h) thereof; and (iv) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than April 20, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the passing of title, possession and delivery of the

EFTA00022874

(b) At least 5 days prior to Closing Escrow Agent shall search FAA records and verify aircraft title is free and clear of all recorded liens, claims and encumbrances.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the following deliveries shall be made to the Escrow Agent by the responsible party indicated:

(i) At least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver the following to Escrow Agent:

(A) A Warranty Bill of Sale in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E transferring title to the Aircraft to Purchaser duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Seller, with his or her title shown, but undated (the "Warranty Bill of Sale"); and

The documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 4(b) are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Escrow Documents".

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall notify each of the others in writing (either by correspondence, fax or e-mail) of the name or names and telephone number of each representative of the respective parties which is to participate in the conference call to be conducted in connection with the Closing (hereinafter the "Closing Conference Call").

EFTA00022875

(e) At the Closing, and after the representatives of each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent have announced their respective attendance on the Closing Conference Call, then the following shall occur:

(i) If (A) the records of the FAA then reflect that Seller is the record owner of the airframe of the Aircraft and that said airframe and the two (2) engines of the Aircraft are free and clear of all recorded liens, claims and encumbrances, and (B) the Escrow Agent has not otherwise received notice of any other lien, claim or encumbrance asserted by any third party with respect to the Aircraft, then the Escrow Agent shall so advise the participants on the Closing Conference Call and then, but only then, the Escrow Agent shall immediately wire the Purchase Price to Seller in accordance with wire transfer instructions which shall be provided to the Escrow Agent by Seller prior to the Closing Date, and simultaneously file with the FAA Registry for recordation, the FAA Bill of Sale, the Application for Registration and any other necessary Escrow Documents and, upon such filings being accomplished, shall then notify each of the participants on the Closing Conference Call of the time of filing of each such Escrow Documents. If the records of the FAA reflect there to be any lien on the Aircraft or Engines, this purchase agreement will be terminated, and the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) thereof.

(ii) Immediately following the above, the following shall occur at the Closing Place:

WHEREAS, Section 4(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part that “...in no event shall the Closing take place later than April 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”)”;

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to extend the April 20, 2021 Closing deadline provided for in Section 4(a) until May 7, 2021, so that May 7, 2021 is the absolute latest date by which Purchaser must close under the Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

1. Section 4(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date".

This SECOND AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Second Amendment") is made and entered into as of the 7th day of May, 2021 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Hyperion Air, LLC ("Seller") and Industrial Integrity Solutions, LLC ("Purchaser"), and amends that certain Aircraft Purchase Agreement by and between Seller and Purchaser entered into as of April 16, 2021 (the "Original Agreement"), as the same was previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Aircraft Purchase Agreement by and between Seller and Purchaser made and entered into as of April 20, 2021 (said Original Agreement, as so amended, the "Agreement"), governing the purchase and the sale of that certain 2008 Keystone Helicopter (Sikorsky) model S-76C++ aircraft, bearing manufacturer's serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal Aviation Administration as N722JE. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in the Agreement.

WHEREAS, Section 4(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part that “...in no event shall the Closing take place later than May 7, 2021 (the “Closing Date”)”;

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline provided for in Section 4(a) until May 13, 2021, so that May 13, 2021 is the absolute final and latest date by which Purchaser must close under the Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Seller is willing to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline until May 13, 2021, effective when and on the condition that immediately upon execution of this Second Amendment Purchaser increases the Deposit by delivering to the Escrow Agent an additional One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and provided further that Purchaser agrees herein that the full amount of the Deposit, as so increased, is non-refundable and immediately, absolutely, and unconditionally due and payable to Seller regardless of whether or not the Closing occurs, and immediately instructs Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit, as so increased, to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

1. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Second Amendment and effective if and only if Purchaser fully complies with such provisions, Section 4(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined),

EFTA00022952

unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the “Closing Date”. The Closing shall take place promptly after: (i) Purchaser’s delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (2) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than May 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the passing of title, possession and delivery of the Aircraft shall take place within the state in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller’s flight crew, if any, in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser.

2. Immediately following Purchaser’s and Seller’s execution of this Second Amendment, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Deposit by delivering an additional One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the full amount of the Deposit, as so increased (i.e., Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), hereinafter referred to as the “Increased Deposit”), shall be non-refundable and immediately, absolutely and unconditionally due and payable to Seller, regardless of whether or not a Closing shall thereafter occur. Concurrently with Purchaser’s delivery of the additional amount of the Deposit to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (and send a copy of the same to Seller) a signed written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to immediately disburse the Increased Deposit to Seller in accordance with Seller’s disbursement directions, without any further writing or approval from Purchaser being required and without any requirement that a Closing occur. If and only if Seller receives the full amount of the Increased Deposit in accordance with Seller’s disbursement instructions, the amount of the Purchase Price Balance required to be paid by Purchaser under the Agreement shall decrease to One Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000). The provisions of Paragraph 1 of this Second Amendment will not be effective unless and until Seller receives the full amount of the Deposit in accordance with Seller’s disbursement instructions.

3. In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of the Agreement and the provisions of this Second Amendment, the provisions of this Second Amendment shall control in all respects. Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Agreement shall remain unchanged, valid and in full force and effect.

4. This Second Amendment may be fully executed in separate counterparts by each of the parties hereto. Any signatures on this Second Amendment may be transmitted via facsimile or e-mail (in pdf format), which signatures shall be deemed originals for all purposes.
