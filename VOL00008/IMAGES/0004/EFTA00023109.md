Dear :

I hope you are both doing well, and have been enjoying the end of year festivities.

I am referring for your attention an MLAT request from the French in relation to their investigation of (who was recently arrested and placed under examination here in Paris). Since I have been in touch anyway with and about the Maxwell bail proceedings, I took the opportunity to mention that this might be coming their way.

Thanks in advance, and happy new year!
