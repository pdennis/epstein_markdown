Hi Bobbi,

Thank you for letting me know. I've reached out to MDC legal counsel to for confirmation that the MDC will comply with Judge Nathan's order. I also separately sent a copy of the order to MDC legal counsel earlier today, so they should be fully aware of their obligations under it.

Have a good weekend.

Best,

Good evening, [redacted] -
In disregard of the Court’s order, the team leader of Ms. Maxwell’s security detail informed Ms. Maxwell that she will not have access to the laptop on Saturday.
(See email below.)
I will be notifying Judge Nathan of MDC’s blatant disregard of the Court’s order.
Perhaps this will move the Court to direct Warden [redacted] to appear and face questions concerning the mistreatment of Ms. Maxwell and misconduct by his staff.

Any assistance you can provide to effect compliance with the order so that Ms. Maxwell has access to the laptop over this long holiday weekend is greatly appreciated.
Thank you. Enjoy the long weekend.
Bobbi

To: BRO/Exec Assistant-

Earlier today I forwarded a copy of the court order directing MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell with access to her laptop on weekends and holidays.

(See email and Order below).

At 3:40 pm, Officer [redacted] told Ms. Maxwell she 'will not be getting the laptop on Saturday.'

Ms. Maxwell informed Officer [redacted] that access to the laptop has been court ordered, to which Officer Regan replied "I don't care."

Be advised: Judge Nathan will be informed of the explicit violation of the Court's order. I urge the MDC to immediately comply with the order or face contempt of court.
