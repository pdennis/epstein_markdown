Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Testifying Witness Questions

I’m attaching the 302 for [REDACTED] from an interview on August 22, 2006. The last paragraph refers to her providing a copy of the hours she worked at Epstein’s residence as well as some notes she made at her time of employment. Can you please send the notes and the documents she provided? I don’t believe we have them.

Also can you please send the notes of the 8/15/06 interview of [REDACTED]? The 302 is attached.

Thanks!
