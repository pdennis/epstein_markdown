Not much to report.
In Epstein, interviews planned for today in Florida were postponed due to weather.
In MCC, two inmates across from Epstein's cell were supposed to be interviewed. One declined the interview and the other had nothing of interest to contribute. He slept through the night and only saw the activities in the morning after Epstein was found in his cell.
Feel free to call me if you have any questions.
