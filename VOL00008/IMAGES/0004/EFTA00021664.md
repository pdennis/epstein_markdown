Thanks, [redacted]. Can you let me know when you have time for a call? I'm having a hard time matching these up to the two accounts. Thanks!

I have uploaded the documents I was able to find in the Epstein Account Document Folder in DOJ USA File Exchange site. You should already have access to that folder.

I also came across two documents requesting removal for Ghislaine Maxwell from the Hyperion Air, Jeffery Epstein and JEGE accounts, I have already provided those accounts documents. I also came across a memo requesting removal of Ghislaine Maxwell from NES LLC Account # [redacted]. I was unable to come across documents for that account. Those removal memos have been placed in the Epstein Accounts Document folder as well.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Thanks

Hi [REDACTED].

Thanks very much. Could you please send us the account statements for a few months after these documents were executed? It would be helpful to see the balances.

Thanks!
