Consistent with passing along all tips that somehow come to us, attached please find a voicemail I received earlier today.

Separately, yesterday I got a call from an attorney named Blair Fellows, who said that she has a client named Joan Werth who has information about Epstein--I didn't get into the substance (because no witness) and said I would pass along her contact information, which is [redacted].

thanks,
