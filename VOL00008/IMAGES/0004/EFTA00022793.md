Hi Melissa

Attached you will find the executed and counter executed APA between Hyperion Air LLC and Industrial Integrity Solutions LLC for Sikorsky S76C++ sn 760750, N722JE.

Additionally, I have attached the Exhibit C Technical acceptance making the deposit hereby non refundable.

At your convenience, can you please return a copy of the APA with your executed Consent and Joinder?

I expect you have already spoken with Rich Munkvold of Industrial Integrity Solutions with respect to lien searches, IR etc, but I will differ to him with respect to the timing of the closing.

I am fairly certain there are no plans to close this week. Let me know what he tells you in this respect.

Sincerely,

# AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of April 16, 2021, by and between HYPERION AIR, LLC, a U.S. Virgin Islands limited liability company, whose address is (“Seller”), and Industrial Integrity Solutions, LLC, a New Mexico limited liability company, whose address is (“Purchaser”).

## RECITATIONS:

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller desires to sell, transfer, and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, one used 2008 Keystone (Sikorsky) model S-76C++ helicopter, bearing manufacturer’s serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) as N722JE, together with said aircraft’s two (2) Turbomeca S.A. model Arriel 2S2 engines bearing Manufacturer’s Serial Nos. 42285TE and 42286TEC, and with all avionics, equipment systems, furnishings and accessories installed on, contained in or attached to said aircraft and engines, all as is more particularly described on Exhibit A, and also including all airframe, engine and accessory logbooks, flight and operation manuals, maintenance and overhaul records, and all other records and paperwork relating to the above-described aircraft and engines in Seller’s possession (collectively, the “Aircraft”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. **Purchase Price; Payment.** Seller agrees to sell, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Aircraft for a total purchase price of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $1,800,000) (the "Purchase Price"), which shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller as follows:

(a) Purchaser shall wire transfer a deposit in the amount of One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $100,000.00) (the "Deposit") to AIC Title Service, LLC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), which Deposit shall be held in escrow and disbursed at the Closing (as hereinafter defined and described) pursuant to the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement; and

(b) The balance of the Purchase Price in the amount of One Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$1,700,000) (the "Purchase Price Balance") shall be paid at the Closing, said Purchase Price Balance to be wire transferred (as and when provided in Section 4(c) hereof) prior to the Closing into the Special Escrow Account (as defined below) of the Escrow Agent for its disbursement to Seller at the Closing upon the satisfaction of the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement.

1.1 **Establishment of Special Escrow Account.** The Deposit has been wire transferred to the general escrow account of the Escrow Agent maintained at JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., 100 N. Broadway Avenue, Suite 401, Oklahoma City, OK 73102. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly cause the Deposit to be transferred to, and maintained in, a special escrow account at said Bank created and maintained solely and exclusively for the

EFTA00022806

purpose of this transaction (the "Special Escrow Account"); and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon provide Seller and Purchaser with the number of the Special Escrow Account and any other information pertinent thereto. The Deposit shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent in the Special Escrow Account, and shall be refundable to Purchaser unless the same becomes nonrefundable in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not place or hold any funds in the Special Escrow Account except for the funds received in connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance).

## 2. Condition of the Aircraft.

(a) At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an airworthy condition, subject, however, to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with a valid FAA standard airworthiness certificate, (d) subject to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with all airworthiness systems functioning in normal working order in accordance with the manufacturer's Operations Manual, (e) in compliance with the mandatory portions of all FAA airworthiness directives and mandatory service bulletins that have been issued with respect to the Aircraft with due dates on or prior to closing, (f) with all applicable remaining manufacturer's and/or vendor's warranties duly assigned by Seller to Purchaser, provided that such warranties are assignable and that any cost of assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in "Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements.

## 3. Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(a) Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FBO facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(b) The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution

(d) The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

(e) During the Pre-Purchase Inspection, Purchaser shall be entitled, to conduct an initial flight test of no more than sixty (60) minutes in duration to be flown by the Seller's pilots with

EFTA00022807

up to three (3) representatives of Purchaser accompanying the flight. All procedures to be adopted during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance occurring during said flight test, those that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller during said flight test, subject, however, at all times to the discretion of the chief pilot who shall have absolute operational discretion and control over the Aircraft.

(f) Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the Aircraft by not later than five (5) business days following the completion of the Pre-Purchase Inspection and the issuance of a written inspection report from the Purchaser’s agent (the "Inspection Report"), copies of which shall be made available to the Seller. Any difference, discrepancy or defect in the Aircraft from any of the Delivery Condition requirements in Section 2 hereof that cause the Aircraft not to be in airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a “Discrepancy”. The Inspection Report shall note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy so noted. At Purchaser’s discretion, Purchaser shall accept the Aircraft in its “as-is”, “where-is” and “with all faults” condition (“Unconditional Acceptance”), or reject the Aircraft (“Rejection”). Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft shall be evidenced by Purchaser’s issuance to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of a Certificate of Technical Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the “Certificate of Technical Acceptance”). If there are one or more Discrepancies which cause Purchaser in its discretion to issue a Rejection, then, within such three (3) business day period, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, written notice of Purchaser’s termination of this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereof (a “Termination Notice”).

(g) If Purchaser timely issues a Termination Notice in accordance with Section 3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof.

(h) If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 hereof, and the parties shall proceed with Closing as hereinafter provided.

## 4. Closing and Delivery.

(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place three (3) business days after: (i) Purchaser’s delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (iv) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than April 20, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the passing of title, possession and delivery of the

EFTA00022808

Aircraft shall take place within the state in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller’s flight crew in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser.

(b) At least 5 days prior to Closing Escrow Agent shall search FAA records and verify aircraft title is free and clear of all recorded liens, claims and encumbrances.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the following deliveries shall be made to the Escrow Agent by the responsible party indicated:

(i) At least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver the following to Escrow Agent:

(A) A Warranty Bill of Sale in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E transferring title to the Aircraft to Purchaser duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Seller, with his or her title shown, but undated (the "Warranty Bill of Sale"); and

(B) An FAA Form Bill of Sale AC 8050-2 in proper form for recordation at the FAA Civil Aircraft Registry to transfer title to the Aircraft to Purchaser duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Seller, with his or her title shown, but undated ("FAA Bill of Sale").

(ii) Purchaser shall:

(A) On or before the Closing Date but prior to Closing, wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance into the Special Escrow Account of the Escrow Agent; and

(B) At least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to the Escrow Agent an Application for Aircraft Registration (AC Form 8050-1) for the Aircraft duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Purchaser, but undated (the "Application for Registration").

The documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 4(b) are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Escrow Documents".

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall notify each of the others in writing (either by correspondence, fax or e-mail) of the name or names and telephone number of each representative of the respective parties which is to participate in the conference call to be conducted in connection with the Closing (hereinafter the "Closing Conference Call"). The Closing Conference Call shall be originated by Purchaser on the Closing Date on or about 10:00 a.m., U.S. Central Daylight Time, so as to complete the Closing, including the filing of the Escrow Documents with the FAA Registry in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, prior to the closing of that office on the Closing Date.

EFTA00022809

(e) At the Closing, and after the representatives of each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent have announced their respective attendance on the Closing Conference Call, then the following shall occur:

(i) If (A) the records of the FAA then reflect that Seller is the record owner of the airframe of the Aircraft and that said airframe and the two (2) engines of the Aircraft are free and clear of all recorded liens, claims and encumbrances, and (B) the Escrow Agent has not otherwise received notice of any other lien, claim or encumbrance asserted by any third party with respect to the Aircraft, then the Escrow Agent shall so advise the participants on the Closing Conference Call and then, but only then, the Escrow Agent shall immediately wire the Purchase Price to Seller in accordance with wire transfer instructions which shall be provided to the Escrow Agent by Seller prior to the Closing Date, and simultaneously file with the FAA Registry for recordation, the FAA Bill of Sale, the Application for Registration and any other necessary Escrow Documents and, upon such filings being accomplished, shall then notify each of the participants on the Closing Conference Call of the time of filing of each such Escrow Document. If the records of the FAA reflect there to be any lien on the Aircraft or Engines, this purchase agreement will be terminated, and the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof.

(ii) Immediately following the above, the following shall occur at the Closing Place:

(A) Seller's representative shall deliver possession of the Aircraft to Purchaser; and

(B) Purchaser shall execute and deliver to Seller a Delivery Receipt in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

(f) Following completion of the Closing as prescribed above, the Escrow Agent shall mail the Warranty Bill of Sale to the address specified by Purchaser.

(g) If all of the conditions and requirements specified in this Section 4 are not satisfied on or before the Closing Date (or such later date as Seller and Purchaser may agree upon in writing and provide to the Escrow Agent), then subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, with which the Escrow Agent shall comply, the Escrow Agent shall do the following:

(i) the Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Documents and the Purchase Price in escrow until Seller and Purchaser furnish the Escrow Agent with a written agreement which gives the Escrow Agent instructions for payment of said funds and release of the Escrow Documents, or, if the Escrow Agent is not furnished with such a written agreement, the Escrow Agent shall retain the Purchase Price and the Escrow Documents in escrow until the Escrow Agent is ordered to pay said

EFTA00022810

funds and release the Escrow Documents in accordance with the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

5. **Fee of Escrow Agent.** The fee of the Escrow Agent (which fee also includes any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent) for performing its duties specified herein shall be paid by each of Purchaser and Seller in equal portions. Their respective portions of said fee shall be paid by them to the Escrow Agent as and when required by the Escrow Agent. In addition to its duties specified above, the duties of the Escrow Agent shall also include delivering a written preliminary title and lien report with respect to the Aircraft, and also a written post-closing title and lien report with respect to the same to each of Purchaser and Seller.

6. **Taxes.** Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay, or reimburse Seller for, any and all sales, excise, gross receipts, use, personal property, transfer or similar taxes, assessments or duties including interest or penalties imposed thereon and any costs incurred in defense of the nonpayment thereof, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the sale and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser or the use, ownership, possession, maintenance or operation of the Aircraft after the Closing, but specifically excluding any income, capital gains or other similar taxes based on the income of Seller or personal property or other similar taxes assessed or based upon Seller's ownership or use of the Aircraft prior to the Closing (which shall be Seller's responsibility). Each party hereto will be responsible for researching its own tax position in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall be deemed to have relied on any advice provided by the other party or such party's advisors and tax professionals. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive Closing. The Parties have agreed that the Closing Place will be at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida. Purchaser will provide Seller with completed Form GT-500002 to qualify for the fly-away sales tax exemption in the state of Florida and will fully comply with all requirements of Florida's fly-away sales tax exemption.

(b) The balance of the Purchase Price in the amount of One Million Seven Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$1,700,000) (the "Purchase Price Balance") shall be paid at the Closing, said Purchase Price Balance to be wire transferred (as and when provided in Section 4(c) hereof) prior to the Closing into the Special Escrow Account (as defined below) of the Escrow Agent for its disbursement to Seller at the Closing upon the satisfaction of the conditions and requirements set forth in this Agreement.

1.1 **Establishment of Special Escrow Account.** The Deposit has been wire transferred to the general escrow account of the Escrow Agent maintained at JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., 100 N. Broadway Avenue, Suite 401, Oklahoma City, OK 73102. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall promptly cause the Deposit to be transferred to, and maintained in, a special escrow account at said Bank created and maintained solely and exclusively for the

EFTA00022832

purpose of this transaction (the "Special Escrow Account"); and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon provide Seller and Purchaser with the number of the Special Escrow Account and any other information pertinent thereto. The Deposit shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent in the Special Escrow Account, and shall be refundable to Purchaser unless the same becomes nonrefundable in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not place or hold any funds in the Special Escrow Account except for the funds received in connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance).

## 2. Condition of the Aircraft.

(a) At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an airworthy condition, subject, however, to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with a valid FAA standard airworthiness certificate, (d) subject to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with all airworthiness systems functioning in normal working order in accordance with the manufacturer's Operations Manual, (e) in compliance with the mandatory portions of all FAA airworthiness directives and mandatory service bulletins that have been issued with respect to the Aircraft with due dates on or prior to closing, (f) with all applicable remaining manufacturer's and/or vendor's warranties duly assigned by Seller to Purchaser, provided that such warranties are assignable and that any cost of assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in "Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements.

## 3. Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(a) Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FBO facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the Pre-Purchase Inspection.

(b) The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution

(d) The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

(e) During the Pre-Purchase Inspection, Purchaser shall be entitled, to conduct an initial flight test of no more than sixty (60) minutes in duration to be flown by the Seller's pilots with

EFTA00022833

up to three (3) representatives of Purchaser accompanying the flight. All procedures to be adopted during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance occurring during said flight test, those that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by Seller during said flight test, subject, however, at all times to the discretion of the chief pilot who shall have absolute operational discretion and control over the Aircraft.

(f) Purchaser shall, in its sole discretion, accept or reject the Aircraft by not later than five (5) business days following the completion of the Pre-Purchase Inspection and the issuance of a written inspection report from the Purchaser’s agent (the “Inspection Report”), copies of which shall be made available to the Seller. Any difference, discrepancy or defect in the Aircraft from any of the Delivery Condition requirements in Section 2 hereof that cause the Aircraft not to be in airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a “Discrepancy”. The Inspection Report shall note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy so noted. At Purchaser’s discretion, Purchaser shall accept the Aircraft in its “as-is”, “where-is” and “with all faults” condition (“Unconditional Acceptance”), or reject the Aircraft (“Rejection”). Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft shall be evidenced by Purchaser’s issuance to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of a Certificate of Technical Acceptance in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (the “Certificate of Technical Acceptance”). If there are one or more Discrepancies which cause Purchaser in its discretion to issue a Rejection, then, within such three (3) business day period, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, written notice of Purchaser’s termination of this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereof (a “Termination Notice”).

(g) If Purchaser timely issues a Termination Notice in accordance with Section 3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof.

(h) If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 hereof, and the parties shall proceed with Closing as hereinafter provided.

## 4. Closing and Delivery.

(a) The closing of this transaction (“the Closing”) and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida (“the Closing Place”) by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such agreed upon date shall be deemed the “Closing Date”. The Closing shall take place three (3) business days after: (i) Purchaser’s delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating Purchaser’s Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (iv) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than April 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the passing of title, possession and delivery of the

EFTA00022834

Aircraft shall take place within the state in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller’s flight crew in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the following deliveries shall be made to the Escrow Agent by the responsible party indicated:

(i) At least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver the following to Escrow Agent:

(A) A Warranty Bill of Sale in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E transferring title to the Aircraft to Purchaser duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Seller, with his or her title shown, but undated (the "Warranty Bill of Sale"); and

(A) On or before the Closing Date but prior to Closing, wire transfer the Purchase Price Balance into the Special Escrow Account of the Escrow Agent; and

(B) At least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to the Escrow Agent an Application for Aircraft Registration (AC Form 8050-1) for the Aircraft duly executed by an authorized representative or the manager of Purchaser, but undated (the "Application for Registration").

The documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 4(b) are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Escrow Documents".

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall notify each of the others in writing (either by correspondence, fax or e-mail) of the name or names and telephone number of each representative of the respective parties which is to participate in the conference call to be conducted in connection with the Closing (hereinafter the "Closing Conference Call").

EFTA00022835

(e) At the Closing, and after the representatives of each of Seller, Purchaser and the Escrow Agent have announced their respective attendance on the Closing Conference Call, then the following shall occur:

(i) If (A) the records of the FAA then reflect that Seller is the record owner of the airframe of the Aircraft and that said airframe and the two (2) engines of the Aircraft are free and clear of all recorded liens, claims and encumbrances, and (B) the Escrow Agent has not otherwise received notice of any other lien, claim or encumbrance asserted by any third party with respect to the Aircraft, then the Escrow Agent shall so advise the participants on the Closing Conference Call and then, but only then, the Escrow Agent shall immediately wire the Purchase Price to Seller in accordance with wire transfer instructions which shall be provided to the Escrow Agent by Seller prior to the Closing Date, and simultaneously file with the FAA Registry for recordation, the FAA Bill of Sale, the Application for Registration and any other necessary Escrow Documents and, upon such filings being accomplished, shall then notify each of the participants on the Closing Conference Call of the time of filing of each such Escrow Documents. If the records of the FAA reflect there to be any lien on the Aircraft or Engines, this purchase agreement will be terminated, and the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) thereof.

(ii) Immediately following the above, the following shall occur at the Closing Place:

(A) Seller's representative shall deliver possession of the Aircraft to Purchaser; and

(B) Purchaser shall execute and deliver to Seller a Delivery Receipt in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F.

(f) Following completion of the Closing as prescribed above, the Escrow Agent shall mail the Warranty Bill of Sale to the address specified by Purchaser.

(g) If all of the conditions and requirements specified in this Section 4 are not satisfied on or before the Closing Date (or such later date as Seller and Purchaser may agree upon in writing and provide to the Escrow Agent), then subject to the provisions of Section 9 thereof, with which the Escrow Agent shall comply, the Escrow Agent shall do the following:

(i) the Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Documents and the Purchase Price in escrow until Seller and Purchaser furnish the Escrow Agent with a written agreement which gives the Escrow Agent instructions for payment of said funds and release of the Escrow Documents, or, if the Escrow Agent is not furnished with such a written agreement, the Escrow Agent shall retain the Purchase Price and the Escrow Documents in escrow until the Escrow Agent is ordered to pay said

EFTA00022836

funds and release the Escrow Documents in accordance with the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

5. **Fee of Escrow Agent.** The fee of the Escrow Agent (which fee also includes any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent) for performing its duties specified herein shall be paid by each of Purchaser and Seller in equal portions. Their respective portions of said fee shall be paid by them to the Escrow Agent as and when required by the Escrow Agent. In addition to its duties specified above, the duties of the Escrow Agent shall also include delivering a written preliminary title and lien report with respect to the Aircraft, and also a written post-closing title and lien report with respect to the same to each of Purchaser and Seller.

6. **Taxes.** Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall pay, or reimburse Seller for, any and all sales, excise, gross receipts, use, personal property, transfer or similar taxes, assessments or duties including interest or penalties imposed thereon and any costs incurred in defense of the nonpayment thereof, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, arising out of, or incurred in connection with, the sale and delivery of the Aircraft to Purchaser or the use, ownership, possession, maintenance or operation of the Aircraft after the Closing, but specifically excluding any income, capital gains or other similar taxes based on the income of Seller or personal property or other similar taxes assessed or based upon Seller's ownership or use of the Aircraft prior to the Closing (which shall be Seller's responsibility). Each party hereto will be responsible for researching its own tax position in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall be deemed to have relied on any advice provided by the other party or such party's advisors and tax professionals. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive Closing. The Parties have agreed that the Closing Place will be at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, Florida. Purchaser will provide Seller with completed Form GT-500002 to qualify for the fly-away sales tax exemption in the state of Florida and will fully comply with all requirements of Florida's fly-away sales tax exemption.
