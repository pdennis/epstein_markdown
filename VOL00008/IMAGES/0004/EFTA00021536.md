Joe,

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with [REDACTED], we were wondering if you could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer vacation plans).

We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance it would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes.

Thanks,

From: Joe Nascimento &lt; &gt;

Joe,

Sure, thanks – and yes, quite the weekend. If it’s alright with you, let’s do 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday – you can reach us at [redacted], or we can also call you then if that’s easier, whatever you prefer.

thanks,

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Hi [redacted],

No need to take any more time out of what I’m sure was a busy weekend for you. Let’s set a time for Tuesday morning (the earlier the better for me). Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,

Joe

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

Look forward to speaking with you.
