Joe,

Thanks for reaching out. We are trying to sort out how to handle the travel issues based on the weather, and we should have a better sense of the plan by later today. As we're troubleshooting scheduling issues, it would be helpful to know if you and your client would be available on 9/5, or on any date the following week.

Thanks,

Good morning,

Just wanted to check in to see if you still planned to travel south given the storm. Current estimates show a landing (somewhere) Tuesday with very bad weather on Wednesday. Airports might close (which will answer my question), but that's a guess.

Hi Joe,

Thanks very much, we'll plan to see you then. We'll most likely meet at a conference space at a hotel in West Palm Beach, and I'll let you know closer in time which location.

Thanks,

Joe,

Following up on scheduling, we were wondering if your client is available for a proffer on September 4th. We're flexible on timing that day, but we would propose meeting at 12:30 p.m., if that works.

Hi &lt;&gt;.

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will work around it.

Hi [Redacted],

I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does [Redacted]. September is a busy month with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I will do everything to be as flexible as possible.

Joe,

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with _______________, we were wondering if you could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer vacation plans).

We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance it would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes.
