All,

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell.

Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

- NYC024363
- NYC024394
- NYC024326
- NYC024368
- NYC024390
- NYC024334
- NYC027910
- NYC024323
- NYC024355
- NYC027908

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the teams.

Thanks very much,
