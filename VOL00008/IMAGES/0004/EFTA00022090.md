Subject: Opinion on Maxwell Motions

Judge Nathan's opinion on the majority of Maxwell's pretrial motions is attached. She granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts but denied the remaining motions, except for the suppression motions with respect to the Boies Schiller materials, which she did not address (they will be decided "in due course").
