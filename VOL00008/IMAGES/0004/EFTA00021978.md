Hi _______________

Thanks so much for all you're doing today, really appreciate it. Attached is a draft of the joint letter for today with the four categories. Could you please fill those in after you've had a chance to enter all the data from the defense? I'm fine with charts in each of the four questions (essentially just one row of cells with juror numbers). Also fine with bullet points. Whichever is easiest.

Whenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know – we'll need to send this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon.

Thanks!
