Marc,

Circling back on this, I'll ask the agents to bring the cash and other personal effects seized from Mr. Epstein to the hearing on Thursday, unless it is important to receive them before then, in which case please let me know and I'll try to arrange that. With respect to the electronic devices, we've obtained a warrant to search them and so will be retaining them as evidence.

thanks,

Subject: Epstein Arrest Seizure Items

Hi . Sorry to bug you while you may be working on a bail reply.

I'm having trouble reaching Agen to coordinate pickup of the cellphone and other items seized upon Epstein's arrest. She said she'd be out in the field, but I don't hear from the intermediary agent — identity unknown — who was supposed to handle it in her absence. Can you step in and try to move this along?

Thanks a lot.

Sorry to trouble again. No answer or VM pickup at that number. I'll try again later so long as it's the right number. Can you confirm? Many thanks.

Marc,

Apologies for the delay on this, and thanks for following up. The best way to coordinate this is to contact the case agent directly – I just spoke to her so she'll be expecting your call. They're running around, so if you reach out and aren't able to connect today please let me know, but hopefully we can get it coordinated. The contact is Special Agent , and she can be reached at

One of your agents told Marty the case agent would return Epstein’s phone, the cash and other items taken from his person upon arrest. Marty’s returning to Boston shortly. Can you arrange for me to take possession of those items?

Thanks,

Marc

Marc,

Wanted to send this to you as well in case your co-counsel can’t receive it in the Court. Please let me know if it would be helpful to get a hard copy – I’m copying two of our paralegals who can bring you (or co-counsel) a copy; I’ll be unreachable for the next hour or so.

thank you,
