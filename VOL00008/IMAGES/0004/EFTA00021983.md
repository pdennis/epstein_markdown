Subject: Discovery Tasks for Maxwell on Epstein Relativity Databases

Thanks very much for speaking earlier today. As discussed, we are asking for the following three productions to be prepared for the Maxwell case. I've listed those tasks below in the order in which we discussed them, but, as we discussed, if you and the vendor believe a different order would be more efficient, please just let me know.

As we've discussed, we need all of these materials to be delivered to 1 St. Andrews by the end of October in order to meet our discovery deadline.

Finally, I believe [redacted] should be sending you a drive containing the scans of boxes of files from the USAO-SDFL. We need all of those files loaded into the US v Epstein database on Relativity in a new folder entitled "USAO-SDFL Files," ASAP so that we can review them, please.

Thanks very much, as always for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions or confusion. I'm always happy to chat.

Thanks so much,
