Thanks for reaching out. I am currently out of the country, but am flying back today. I’ve copied in Tom Moyer who has been primarily assisting us with this matter while Parvin has been out of the country. I believe we are preparing a subsequent production for SDNY to be produced shortly, but Tom will confirm and let you know about timing.

I understand that Epstein had an initial client advisor who is no longer with the bank, but there was coverage over the relationship after he left. Tom and Parvin should be able to give you info on this point and how we can coordinate an interview(s) as you describe, ASAP.

I will also be back later today/this evening if you would like to speak directly.

Best regards,

Andrew

Andrew,

Following up on our discussions last week, we wanted to follow up on the status and expected timing of continued rolling productions in response to the subpoena in connection with Jeffrey Epstein. Could you please let us know?

Separately, I imagine—though of course please correct me if this is wrong—that for Mr. Epstein there was an individual or team responsible for managing the relationship. We would like to get a sense of his banking history generally, in terms of how he utilized his accounts, what types of financial activities he engaged in, etc., separate from just the documents themselves (which it sounds like will be extremely voluminous and include more than 60 separate accounts). Please let us know how we can best facilitate that kind of discussion with a knowledgeable person or persons?

thank you,
