We're doing a brief follow up call this morning at 10 with the FCA, the British regulator who, as discussed, is looking at Jes Staley and his potential relationship with Epstein. No need at all to join if you're otherwise occupied – my guess is this will be a brief update (from them) and a request from us that they not go overt anytime soon – but if of interest, feel free to swing by at 10.
