Note that this is the same individual who called us in October (see attached email and associated voicemail), so I imagine it already has either been addressed or is in the queue.

The attached voicemail is from someone who claims to have information pertinent to our ongoing investigation. Per our policy of passing along civilian information, I'm forwarding so that the FBI can handle as it sees fit.

Thanks,
