Matt,

With apologies: I now need to meet with a witness starting at 4 today, so unfortunately 4:30 no longer works. Happy to talk between now and 4, or later this evening, if either works. Alternatively, I'm free at 9:30 tomorrow morning, or between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. tomorrow.

Thanks,

From: Matthew L. Schwartz &lt; &gt;

4:30 is perfect. Where should I call?

Hi Matt,

I'm available for a call tomorrow either at 1 p.m. or anytime from 4:30 onwards, if either of those windows works for you.

Best,

Thanks . If any of you have a moment for a forfeiture-related question in the next few days, please let me know. FYI, this has nothing to do with my firm's representation of certain victims. Thanks.

Hi Matt,

The Epstein case team are AUSAs , and , all cc'd on this email. They're the right people to talk to about anything Epstein-related.

Do either of you guys or the appropriate other person have 2 minutes to discuss a somewhat time-sensitive, but by no means urgent, Epstein-related forfeiture question in the next few days?
