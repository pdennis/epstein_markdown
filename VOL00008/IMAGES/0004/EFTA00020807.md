Ah, possibly it's the "2020-01-23" folder under Subpoena Returns? If so, [redacted], can we please (1) move that to under the Search Warrant Returns folder, and (2) if at all possible, combine the 37 different subfolders into one? There doesn't appear to be any distinction between all of those folders so I don't think there's any utility in having so many subgroups. But let us know if (2) is a problem and happy to discuss.

I think they are in the Subpoena Returns folder, which I thought was strange. I'm heading to [redacted] now but will log in after that to find them.

[redacted], just tried calling but didn't catch you — I don't see where these are located in Relativity? I think they should be under "Search Warrant Returns" but I don't see them there (or anywhere else under the Epstein overall folder). Let me know if I've just missed them, which is entirely possible, or if they're not accessible to us yet? Thank you!

Here's the STR and the data should be released soon, it's just taking a while because the load is so large.

New data is loaded and we've segregated the PP hits; you should have access to the new data today. Will keep you posted.

Thanks, [redacted]

[redacted], wanted to follow up on this – is the data fully uploaded, or did it get delayed? Thanks.

Wanted to quickly check the status of the below – it's only been a couple weeks, so totally understand it may not be complete, but hopefully we're getting close? If you could please check with the vendor and let us know, we'd be grateful – and we'll plan to get it to █ asap once we have access.

thanks,

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by █ (copied here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming shortly.)

And then █, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein search warrant returns.

Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.
