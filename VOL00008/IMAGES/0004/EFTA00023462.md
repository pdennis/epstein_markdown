All –

I have confirmed that the government has incorporated all of the defense's proposed redactions within the government's proposed redactions. We do not have any more to add. For the record, we oppose the government redactions that are additional to the defense's redactions.

We will now file the defense's motions and exhibits, as redacted/sealed, and then wait for you to file the government's response. It may take a little time to get them all filed, so bear with me.

Thanks,

Chris

Happy to jump on a call. We're almost finished with the materials we'll be sending you in a second wave, so why don't we get the first wave filed, and we'll send you the second set, and then we can get on the phone. Does that work?

Got it. We are filing the response now.

I was thinking through the joint cover letter and I think there are a few more logistics we have to discuss. Can you jump on a quick call?

The reductions are consistent with what the government had proposed before. We do not have any reductions to add to these documents. But for the record, we object to all of the government's proposed reductions.

Please send me the next batch when you have them ready.

Thanks,

Chris

All,

Thanks for the call this afternoon, it was helpful to work through the mechanics of filing reductions this afternoon. As we discussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with reductions applied: (1) the Government's motion in limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply.

Please let us know if you would like us to add any reductions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to Exhibits:

- We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A.
- Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without reductions.
- All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal.

Best,
