Request Number: 2019-05665

Dear Ms. Ivory:

This is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which we received on August 13, 2019. Specifically, you request various documents regarding inmate Jeffrey Epstein.

After a thorough review of your request, we have determined that any records responsive to your request are categorically exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, this Office is not required to conduct a search for the requested records. Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, records are withheld in full from disclosure to you under the following exemptions:

(b)(5) - inter- or intra-agency correspondence which would not be available to a party other than a party in litigation with the agency
(b)(6) - constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
(b)(7)(A) - could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings
(b)(7)(C) - constitutes an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
(b)(7)(E) - discloses investigative techniques and procedures
(b)(7)(F) - could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual

Please note, exemption (b)(7)(A) is a temporary exemption utilized to protect active and on-going law enforcement proceedings. Because of its temporary nature, you may wish to consider refiling your request for records in the future. Should you chose to refile your request, the status of law enforcement proceedings will be reevaluated and a determination made at that time as to the continued applicability of exemption (b)(7)(A).

If you have questions about this response please feel free to contact me at
