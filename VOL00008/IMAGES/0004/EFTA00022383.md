## Dividend and interest income earned

For purposes of this statement, taxability of interest and dividend income has been determined from a US tax reporting perspective. Based upon the residence of the account holder, account type, or product type, some interest and/or dividend payments may not be subject to United States (US) and/or Puerto Rico (PR) income taxes. The client monthly statement is not intended to be used and cannot be relied upon for tax purposes. Clients should refer to the applicable tax reporting forms they receive from UBS annually, such as the Forms 1099 and the Forms 480, for tax reporting information. It is the practice of UBS to file the applicable tax reporting forms with the US Internal Revenue Service and PR Treasury Department, and in such forms accurately classify dividends and/or interest as tax exempt or taxable income. Please consult your individual tax preparer.
