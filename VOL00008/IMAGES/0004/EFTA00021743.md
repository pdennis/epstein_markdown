[Redacted] so sorry, we are stuck in transit. Can I call you when I am back at my desk? It should be within the next half hour. Apologies.

Thanks—it's possible we'll still be in a meeting at 4:30. Would it be possible to speak at 5 instead? If not, we can plan for 4:30 and let you know if we need to reschedule.

Thanks,

Hi

Do you have a few minutes for a quick call tomorrow afternoon? We are making a disclosure that relates to your client in connection with our discovery obligations to Epstein's counsel, and we wanted to briefly make you aware of it.

Thanks,
