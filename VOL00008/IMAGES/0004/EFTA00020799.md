Just bumping this – any conflicts for you this week (other than Tuesday morning)?

How about y'all - " " " " " " " is occupied Tuesday morning but that's bad for the agents anyway; any other conflicts? Once we know scheduling I'll email " " " " " " " " to try to set up a time.

Two quick things – first, we’d like to set up a meeting for this coming week with __________, who previously worked with Epstein, and possibly __________ as well. I don’t believe they were underage victims of Epstein, but they apparently have useful information and also may have been victims of coercive sexual encounters with Epstein and/or his associates. Any days or times this week you would *not* be available for that?

Separately, there have now been two stories in the Times where a publicist, Mr. R. Couri Hay, has been referenced as having recently been told by Epstein about Epstein’s prior conduct. Can we please try to contact him? Can issue him a subpoena, attached, if he doesn’t want to be interviewed informally.

(Here’s the latest reference to him: “Just three months ago, as federal prosecutors were closing in with new charges, Mr. Epstein had a conversation with R. Couri Hay, a publicist, about continuing to improve his reputation. Mr. Epstein asserted that what he was convicted of did not constitute pedophilia, said Mr. Hay, who declined to represent him. The girls he had sex with were “tweens and teens,” Mr. Epstein told him.”)
