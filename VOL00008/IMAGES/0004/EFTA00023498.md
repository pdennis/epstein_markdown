Hi _______________:

I reached out to _______________ about this, who has been keeping track of these files. Isn’t this something that you all would have a copy of from when you scanned our files? Just trying to track it down.

Subject: Question re SDFL Epstein file

Hi _______________:

Hope you’re doing well. We have a small follow-up question about the Jeffrey Epstein file. I’m attaching a privilege log filed by your office in connection with the CVRA lawsuit. We were hoping you might be able to send us the item on page 5 of the log, which has the following description: “File folder entitled “_______________ (N.Y. AUSA)” containing attorney ( _______________ ) handwritten notes.” The log gives the following identifiers for the document: “Box #1 P-003679 Thru P-003680.”

Thanks very much – we’re currently briefing an issue relating to this, so we really appreciate your help.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
