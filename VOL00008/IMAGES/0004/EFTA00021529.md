Thanks [REDACTED]. Until we receive a final report, we plan to tell the Court that the investigation is ongoing.

Hi [REDACTED],

The investigation is nearing completion. He was given an incident report for self mutilation yesterday and is expected to have his DHO hearing in the near future. The original claims against Tartaglione appear unfounded, but we are still awaiting the final report.

Thank you,

Hi [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].

Is the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's injuries still ongoing? I ask because we have a conference before Judge Berman tomorrow morning, and we expect that he will ask us about what happened at the MCC. If the investigation is still ongoing, we will tell him that. If it has been completed, would you please send us any new reports and whatever documentation sets forth the conclusions that the investigators reached?

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
