Hi ,

I was out of the office when you sent this email. I also will be out of the office this full week. I know and are both back now but am happy to give you call to discuss logistics, as I will be helping on this when I'm back.

Thanks,

Following up on this, I'll be working this evening and all weekend, so I'm happy to have a call whenever works for you in that timeframe. Ideally, I'd like to touch base before Monday so that we can hit the ground running with the review first thing Monday morning.

Thanks very much,

Subject: Image/Video file review for Maxwell case

Hi ,

My supervisors gave me your name as the point of contact at the FBI to help coordinate the review of images and videos from Jeffrey Epstein's devices for discovery in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Thank you so much for being willing to help out with this while and are traveling.

I've spoken with about some of the logistics, and it would be great if you and I could have a call to talk about next steps. Is there a time this afternoon when you would be free for a call?

Thanks,
