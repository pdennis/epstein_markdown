, see attached. If you would like, I can forward to [REDACTED]. My only time sensitive request is whether it is your intention (and if no decision has yet been reached until you return let me know and we will wait) whether I will need to ask eg AUSA [REDACTED] or AUSA [REDACTED] to preserve documents or whether I can expect that this request will be forwarded to appropriate persons by you and your team.

Thanks

Marty,

I think it would be useful for you to send that follow-up letter today or tomorrow, and we should be able to incorporate it into our response. Apologies again for the delay but it is in progress.

thanks,

Hi , hopefully your travels are for personal pleasure and not business but I won't inquire. I have a followup letter than focuses on AUSA (SD Fla) and whether you would send a request to her to preserve potentially relevant documents. I can either email it to you today so you can consider it in concert with the other requests or hold it and we can discuss further when you return

Thanks

Marty,

I'm unfortunately traveling this afternoon and tomorrow through the weekend – we had hoped to get you a responsive letter very shortly but it may be next week instead. Apologies for the delay, but we could speak Monday or Tuesday and in any event will get you the full response in the coming days as well.

thanks,

Hi

Can we have a short call regarding what I can reasonably expect in the way of my earlier letter seeking your notifying other relevant districts, DOJ of my preservation request.

Thanks
