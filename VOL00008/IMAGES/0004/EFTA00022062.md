FROM: The Central Authority of the United States

TO: The Central Authority of the United Kingdom

SUBJECT: Request for Assistance in the Matter of Material Witness PA

DATE: April 3, 2020

The Central Authority of the United States of America (“U.S.”) requests the assistance of the Central Authority of the United Kingdom (“UK”) under the 1994 Treaty of Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters between the U.S. and the UK, as amended by the 16 December 2004 Instrument and exchange of notes (“the Treaty”). The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (collectively the “U.S. authorities”) seek to interview H.R.H. Prince Andrew Albert Christian Edward, the Duke of York, also known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (“Prince Andrew” or “the witness”), relating to two ongoing criminal investigations. In addition, U.S. authorities seek records of certain communications and meetings between Prince Andrew and the subjects of one investigation.

With regard to the interview, U.S. authorities request to conduct a voluntary interview of Prince Andrew and request the assistance of UK authorities in arranging for such an interview. In the event that the witness declines to participate in a voluntary interview, U.S. authorities request that UK authorities conduct a compelled interview of the witness under oath.

EFTA00022062

The U.S. authorities may use the requested records and information in the U.S. criminal investigation and proceedings, as defined at Article 19 of the Treaty, and in other U.S. criminal investigations and proceedings, as well as non-criminal judicial or administrative proceedings directly related to the U.S. criminal investigations and proceedings, pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty.

## CONFIDENTIALITY

The U.S. authorities are conducting ongoing criminal investigations. Notwithstanding that one or more of the persons referenced in this request is aware to some extent of the U.S. authorities' attention to this matter, this request also recounts specifics and evidentiary detail that may not be known, exposure of which could impede the investigation with regard to the integrity of evidence and witness accounts. Because the persons referenced in this request are generally aware of the U.S. authorities' investigations, U.S. authorities are not requesting that the existence of this legal assistance request be kept confidential. However, premature notification of the specific subject matter and the questions outlined in the attachments to this request could seriously jeopardize the investigations or compromise any trial, by prompting a witness to alter or prepare his/her answers to specific questions, by prompting others to destroy or tamper with evidence; change patterns of behavior; intimidate potential witnesses; or alert others who could do the same. Accordingly, and pursuant to articles 4(3)(j) and 7 of the Treaty, please keep the contents of this request, including the subject matter of questioning and the questions themselves, confidential and please ensure that they are not shared with any persons (including the witness, the witness's representatives, or subjects of the investigation), or with any government officials whose knowledge is not absolutely necessary for purposes of executing this request. In addition, please advise all who must be made aware of this request that the contents are to be kept confidential and

EFTA00022063

should not be shared with any witness, potential subjects of the investigation or any other persons. If this request cannot be executed without breaching such confidentiality, please notify U.S. authorities through the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of International Affairs prior to taking any action. U.S. authorities also request that UK authorities keep a written log of all those individuals who have been made aware of the contents of this request, noting when those individuals were so made aware.

## THE FACTS

## Investigation I: The Jeffrey Epstein Investigation

U.S. citizen Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have engaged in the sexual abuse of minor girls during the period of approximately 1994 through 2005. On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an Indictment charging Epstein with violations of U.S. criminal laws in connection with his sexual abuse of minors, including with engaging in a conspiracy to sexually traffic in minors. Epstein was arrested pursuant to the Indictment on or about July 6, 2019, and had been detained pending trial in New York. On or about August 10, 2019, Epstein committed suicide in his cell. Notwithstanding Epstein’s death, the investigation that led to his indictment remains ongoing. That ongoing investigation has revealed evidence of additional criminal conduct by Epstein’s associates, including Ghislaine Maxwell.

The investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation. For example, one victim has alleged that Maxwell introduced her to Prince Andrew who, according to this victim, was present for certain of the victim’s interactions with Epstein and Maxwell. Additionally, documentary evidence uncovered during the course of this investigation has revealed information suggesting that Prince Andrew had knowledge that Maxwell recruited females to

EFTA00022064

engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men. Finally, there is evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein’s victims. Prince Andrew is not presently a target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law.

## Investigation II: The Peter Nygard Investigation

The U.S. authorities are investigating Peter Nygard, a Canadian citizen, and other co-conspirators’ involvement in an international sex trafficking ring victimizing adult women and minor girls. The investigation concerns, among other things, allegations of sex trafficking at various locations inside and outside the United States, including Nygard’s estate in Lyford Cay, Bahamas, referred to as “Nygard Cay.” Sex trafficking victims were transported internationally, including between the Bahamas and locations in the United States.

The investigation of Peter Nygard and others is ongoing and no charges have been filed as of this date. The investigation has revealed that, on at least one occasion, Prince Andrew travelled to Nygard Cay in the Bahamas, a location where Nygard is believed to have trafficked minor and adult female victims. U.S. authorities seek to question Prince Andrew regarding his visit(s) to Nygard Cay during the time period under investigation, and other information he may have about Peter Nygard and related individuals. Prince Andrew is not presently a target of this investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, collected evidence that he committed any crime under U.S. law.
