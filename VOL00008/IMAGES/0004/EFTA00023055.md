During the course of PBPD's investigation, a search warrant for Epstein's home was obtained and executed. Many of Epstein's belongings were removed from the home prior to the execution of the search warrant - for example, the computer processing units (CPUs) were removed from the house but the computer screens, keyboards, cords, etc. were left behind. The missing CPU's were never recovered.

During the search, several telephone message pads were recovered. These message pads show messages taken from several of the girls who were interviewed and admitted to engaging in sexual massages or other sexual activity with Epstein. The messages contained text such as "I have a female for him" and "has girl for tonight." Some of the messages from the girls were addressed to Epstein and others were addressed to [redacted]. Additional messages recovered during the search contained text confirming appointment times.

During the PBCRA's investigation, that [redacted] would contact [redacted]

In addition to the home in Palm Beach, Epstein also maintains a residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands, New York and New Mexico.

To date, the PBCRA continues to develop witnesses and victims from across the United States. Due to the media coverage, unknown status of the state investigation, vulnerability of the young female victims, and political influences, the AUSAs and Case Agents have a target date of January 2007 for indictment.

Based on the ongoing criminal investigation, the PBCRA is requesting the assistance in establishing Epstein's criminal activity utilizing interstate commerce and the travel in interstate commerce to engage in illicit sexual conduct and prostitution. Prior to conducting captioned leads, it is requested that the lead agent(s) contact SA FBI Miami, West Palm RA, or SA for investigative direction and questions.
