Could we please load the documents in the following folder into Relativity for US v. Epstein (USAO # 2018R01618):

\\Usa.doj.gov\cloud\NYS\StAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\Investigation\# 2018 SDNY investigation\Subpoena Returns\Boies Schiller\2019-03-04. Boies Schiller first subpoena response

In terms of structure, we'd like to create a folder identified as "Subpoena Returns" (at the same level as "FBI Case File" is currently), and in a subfolder within Subpoena Returns, a folder titled "BSF returns," and within that a subfolder identified as "BSF first production" that the docs in the above link can be deposited into (including any additional subfolders). Does that work?

Please let me know if any questions or if any other information would be helpful, and if you could please let us know when it's all uploaded?

thanks very much,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
