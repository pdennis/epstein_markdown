I recommend you contact the appropriate title company for the title/escrow file.

They accept summons and subpoenas, most of them accept them via fax.

I hope this helps.

I'm retiring on September 30 and if you need additional assistance please contact my Supervisor;

Hi [redacted].

I hope all's well. We've had a chance to review the records, and we'd like to learn more about one aircraft in particular. (I've pasted your notes on it below.)

From our conversation, it sounds like the best next step is to contact the title companies involved. Do you have contacts at Insured Aircraft Title Service Inc. and Aero Records and Title Co.? If not, I'll just give them a call.

Thanks,

In March 2010, Air Ghislaine Inc changed the tail number from N750A to N722JE. On the 8050-64 the signature is not legible but it looks

similar to the signature of Lawrence VISOSKI. He signed as Director of Operations for Shmitka Air Inc., f/k/a Air Ghislaine Inc.

On August 25, 2010, N722JE was registered to Freedom Air International Inc., Wilmington, Delaware 19803

2007 Gulfstream GV-SP (G550), serial number 5173 was assigned tail number N415LM in March 2017 and was registered to

Chevron USA Inc., Oakland, CA. Per a bill of sale dated March 29, 2017, Chevron USA Inc sold Gulfstream N415LM to;

Plan D LLC

EFTA00021676

St. Thomas, U.S. Virgins Islands

The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager

I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. he is a pilot

I don't see EPSTEIN's name on any of the FAA paperwork.

There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN.

It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction.

https://insuredaircraft.com/

Per the Plan D LLC, statement in support of registering aircraft that was submitted to the FAA, Jeffrey E. EPSTEIN was a member

and VISOSKI was the manager. Further, Plan D LLC was established in 2012 in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Per a request to the FAA dated August 07, 2017 from VISOSKI, they requested to change the tail number from N415LM to N212JE.

In January 2018 they changed the tail number to N212JE. VISOSKI provided phone number and e-mail:

On August 14, 2019 I was told that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and was in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Flight plans indicated N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it operated from

Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK).

Per a bill of sale dated December 22, 2020, Lawrence VISOSKI on behalf of Plan D LLC "sold" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC who "sold" it the same day

to N550GP LLC in Ontario, CA. N212JE was registered on February 24, 2021 to N550GP and James PREVITI signed as manager of Frontier JV LLC, its member.

in March 2021, they changed the tail number to N550GP and it's still registered as N550GP to N550GP LLC.

It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled this transaction also.

I attached a picture of N212JE.

1969 Boeing 727, serial number 20115, N505LS was sold on January 19, 2001 by Real Estate Exchange Inc., Portland, OR

to JEGE Inc. New York, NY 10022. The signature on the aircraft registration application is not legible

but they listed their title as President. They changed the tail number to N908JE in April 2001. On the 2013 re-registration application for N908JE,

Darren K. INDYKE, Vice President signed as Vice President of JEGE Inc.

They were the registered owner of N908JE from 2001 until October 05, 2019 when the registration was cancelled.

The aircraft was on the Part 125 certificate of JEGE Inc. and the CEO was Jeffrey EPSTEIN,

West Palm Beach, FL 33406 Phone

N908JE was certificated for passenger operations only (not cargo).

N908JE has a business configuration with a kitchen and bedroom and has approximately 25 seats in the aircraft and they aren't economy seats.

It was used for private business not charter flights.

https://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/1237885/n908je-boeing-727-100

EFTA00021677

N908JE might be in Brunswick, Georgia (BQK). If you need confirmation of its location please advise.

I think Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction. https://insuredaircraft.com/

In 1994, a 1974 Gulfstream G-1159B, serial number 151, N979GA was sold by Gulfstream to Hyperion Air Inc., Wilmington, Delaware. David RODGERS signed as the Chief Pilot and Jeffrey EPSTEIN signed as President.

The signature of EPSTEIN looks similar to the signature on the N505JS that became N909JE documents.

In May 1994 they changed the tail number to N909JE. In 1999 and 2013 we see Darren K. INDYKE name on documents on behalf of

Hyperion Air Inc. In November 2013 they sold N909JE to Starbridge Landing Inc., Dover, Delaware  $\mathbb{O}$  . The aircraft was deregistered on December 02, 2014 for export to Venezuela.

tail number to N331JE. In August 2013 they transferred N331JE to Hyperion Air LLC,  $\mathbb{O}$  St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

The same players in the Inc and LLC are on the FAA registration paperwork - Darren INDYKE and Lawrence VISOSKI.

In November 2019 they provide phone number

In May 2020 they sold helicopter N331JE to CMG Aircraft Leasing Inc., Miami, FL (broker), who sold it the same day to QIR Air Resources LLC,

Salt Lake City, Utah. In July 2020 they changed the tail number to N430D.

on October 19, 2012 and the members were Jeffrey EPSTEIN and Lawrence VISOSKI.

In June 2019, an Aircraft Security Agreement for $2,800,000.00 on N120JE was filed with the FAA reflecting JEGE Inc., Powder Springs, GA 30127

as assignor and , New Bern, NC 28562 as secured party.

on October 19, 2012 and the members were Aviation Development Group LLC and the manager was Thomas H. Huff.

He is Thomas Harrison HUFF Ika/Powder Springs, GA

He's a pilot and has been involved in aviation at the Cobb County airport (RYY), in Kennesaw, GA for many years.

EFTA00021678

He is of interest to DEA S/A in Atlanta, GA

The aircraft is still registered to JEGE LLC, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

I suspect HUFF bought JEGE LLC which included the aircraft.
