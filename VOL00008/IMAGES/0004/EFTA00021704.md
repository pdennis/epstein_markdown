So the short answer is that the load files are not completed yet. One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. The limitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as quickly as I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration date, so that took priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load files, but the process is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK right now.
