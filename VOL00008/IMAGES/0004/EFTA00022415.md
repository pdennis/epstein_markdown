## Dividend and interest income earned

For purposes of this statement, taxability of interest and dividend income has been determined from a US tax reporting perspective. Based upon the residence of the account holder, account type, or product type, some interest and/or dividend payments may not be subject to United States (US) and/or Puerto Rico (PR) income taxes. The client monthly statement is not intended to be used and cannot be relied upon for tax purposes. Clients should refer to the applicable tax reporting forms they receive from UBS annually, such as the Forms 1099 and the Forms 480, for tax reporting information. It is the practice of UBS to file the applicable tax reporting forms with the US Internal Revenue Service and PR Treasury Department, and in such forms accurately classify dividends and/or interest as tax exempt or taxable income. Please consult your individual tax preparer.

## Cash alternatives

### Money market funds

Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.

Total reinvested is the total of all reinvested dividends. It does not include any cash dividends. It is not a tax lot for the purposes of determining holding periods or cost basis. The shares you receive each time you reinvest dividends become a separate tax lot.

Cost basis is the total purchase cost of the security, including reinvested dividends. The cost basis may need to be adjusted for return of capital payments in order to determine the adjusted cost basis for tax reporting purposes.

Unrealized (tax) gain or loss is the difference between the current value and the cost basis and would generally be your taxable gain or loss if the security was sold on this date. The unrealized (tax) gain or loss may need to be adjusted for return of capital payments in order to determine the realized gain or loss for tax reporting purposes.

Investment return is the current value minus the amount you invested. It does not include shares that are not reflected on your statement, including shares that have been realized as either a gain or a loss. It also does not include cash dividends that were not reinvested.
