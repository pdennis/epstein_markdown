Team,

Attached are the transcripts of [redacted] depositions. I'd like to schedule a team call for Friday to discuss them. Does 10 a.m. Friday work for everyone for a call to discuss? If you need more time to review them, let me know and we can push to Monday.

Thanks,

From: Weinstein, Marc A.

The transcripts are attached. We trust that the US Attorney's Office will keep these confidential other than to the extent disclosure is required in any pending case.

Marc

Hi Marc,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in on the status of this issue – have you been able to connect with Mr. Scarola?

Marc,

Thanks for following up on this. If it’s okay with you, I think it makes sense to connect you with the plaintiff’s attorney, Jack Scarola, so that he can convey this to you directly. I have spoken with him and explained the context here, and he has told me that he would be happy to speak with you. He is also seeking a copy of the transcript, as he has informed me that he no longer has his case files for matters this old. Here is his contact information:

Jack Scarola

Thank you,

We haven’t found a governing protective order, but to be safe, would you be able to get a letter or email from attorney stating that they are not aware of a protective order/agreement governing the disclosure of the transcript, and to the extent one existed, they are waiving any provisions in order to permit the Estate to provide the transcript to the US Attorney’s Office, and that they will not claim, in any forum, that the Co-Executors, the Estate, or any representatives of either, breached any such order/agreement in that case by providing the transcript to the US Attorney’s Office.

Let us know if that works on your end.

Best regards,
Marc

Hi Marc,

[redacted] we are still looking to see what confidentiality restrictions might apply. If her lawyer has any such confidentiality or protective order that governed the case, it might be helpful if you could obtain and share that.

Thanks . It wasn't clear to me from the call that it was the plaintiff's deposition that you were after, as opposed to another witness in the case. Now that it's clear, we will see if we can track it down.

Marc,

Thanks for speaking earlier. The plaintiff's name is [redacted] who is represented by Jack Scarola. The deposition took place in 2009, and Jeffrey Epstein was represented by Mark Luttier and Bob Critton of Critton, Luttier, and Coleman LLP in West Palm Beach.
