Good evening -

During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting room that I have been required

to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room.

Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim

the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner room.

I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the

EFTA00023482</bcsternheim@mac.com>

larger corner room.

The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid.

Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below.

Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries.

Thank you-

Bobbi
