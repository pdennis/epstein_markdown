Attached is the reply letter Maxwell's counsel filed in further support of her motion to stay [redacted] case. Alarmingly, they come out and say that they believe she is one of the victims named in the indictment, teetering dangerously close to a violation of the protective order in our case.

My plan is still to file our letter in support of a stay as is this evening. Please let me know if anyone would like to discuss or revise our letter further before filing.

Thanks,
