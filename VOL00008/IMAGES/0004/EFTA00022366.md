# Signature Page

By signing below and depositing cash or securities in my accounts, I acknowledge that I have read, understand and agree with the enclosed UBS Client Relationship Agreement, as well as the terms, conditions and disclosures in the enclosed Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

## Margin Agreement

I acknowledge that when I use margin privileges, UBS will hold the securities in my Account as collateral against the amounts I borrow. I agree to keep sufficient positions and margin in my Account to meet any margin calls UBS may be required to issue. By signing below, I agree that the Margin Agreement in my Client Relationship Agreement applies to all of my accounts, including any accounts that I may open in the future. Note: UBS does not extend margin for certain types of accounts (e.g., IRA and ERISA Plan accounts, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, 403(b)(7) Accounts, UGMA/UTMA, Estate or 529 Plan Accounts).

Likewise, I acknowledge and agree that certain securities in my account, including any account I may open in the future, may be loaned to UBS or to other persons or entities as described in the Margin Agreement.

## W-9 Form Certification

Under penalties of perjury, I certify that (1) the number shown on this form, with your BSC address, is a current certified post number (or bank waiting list number to be issued to me), and (2) I am not subject to backup withholding because (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest and dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding, and (3) I am a U.S. citizen, with the IRS's personal identification number.

Certification Instruction: You must cross out item (2) above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return.

The Internal Revenue Service does not require your consent to any provision of this document other than the certification required to avoid backup withholding.

The Client Relationship Agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause located in the final section under the title "Arbitration."
