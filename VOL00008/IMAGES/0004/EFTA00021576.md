More photos of the Austrian passport...The last 2 photos are taken of Epstein's expired US passport also found in the safe from around the same time period of the Austrian passport with a photo of Epstein for comparison.

So there does appear to be a Marius Fortelni, originally from Austria, currently living in Southampton, NY – see:

http://www.mariusfortelni.com/

Notably—given the “residence” entry on the passport—according to Mr. Fortelni’s website he resided for a time in Saudi Arabia. If it’s possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni’s birthday, and see if it matches up with the [redacted] date on the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein’s photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein’s mansion?? Given the time pressure I think it’s totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y’all.

Thank you!!
