Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell renewed bail application

Attachments: MAXWELL_BAIL_APPLICATION_with_EXHIBIT_2-23-17.pdf

I hope all is well. Ghislaine Maxwell’s attorneys filed a third bail application earlier today. As part of that application, they proposed that she will renounce her French and British citizenship, claiming that such a renunciation obviates the Court’s concerns about the validity of waivers of extradition. I have attached their application here. We have not yet been ordered to reply, but would be grateful for your thoughts when you have a chance.

Thanks very much,
