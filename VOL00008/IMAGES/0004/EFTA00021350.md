Great! For sure, will do.

Thanks again for sending this! Not sure there's a federal nexus, but the lawyer representing the victims represents several Epstein victims, so I might reach out to her to see if there could possibly be something to work with.

If you see anything else like this, I'd be happy to have it passed along to me. I'm hoping to bring more sex abuse cases in VOC.

This may be dumb and I don't know if there's a federal nexus, but thought this was interesting (and had no idea who else to send it to).
