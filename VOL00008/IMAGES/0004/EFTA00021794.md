We very much appreciated that, and we just wanted to let you know that the lack of communication separate from that discussion shouldn't be interpreted in any way negatively. We'll certainly be in touch again when we're able.

Joe,

We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.

thank you,

Hi [redacted],

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will work around it.
