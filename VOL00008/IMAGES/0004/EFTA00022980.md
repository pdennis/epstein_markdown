Dear  ☐,

Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate and did not create a misleading impression.

We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, condemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been “zero co-operation”. This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements ascribed to Mr Berman and to the DOJ/FBI: “F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out to his lawyers and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar with the investigation.” (New York Times 27.01.20) and “Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal prosecutors and the FBI had asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but had been met with a wall of silence”(The Telegraph 28.01.20).

Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the DOJ/FBI including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers.

We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the DOJ will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that DOJ personnel and the US Attorney would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular would not comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the DOJ. We ask you to confirm that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the DOJ.

Kind regards

Gary

Gary,

Our understanding is that U.S. Attorney Berman made a factual statement in response to a specific question that suggested the Duke of York either would or was cooperating, and he responded that to date he has not in fact provided cooperation with our investigation. That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate statement; I don't believe this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your client has a desire to cooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to whether he is in fact willing to speak with us.

The press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has disclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and  ,  ,  and  .

It has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the Southern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to do so.

We are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to advise the Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation. Please confirm that the DOJ will not be making any further public statements on this topic.

Thank you.

We are very grateful for your offer of assistance. At present we do not believe you can help us but we would welcome a real-time conversation once we have achieved some of the more immediate preliminary tasks, including the need to gather information from the Royal Household and others.

Gary,

Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to handle further processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would be grateful for some understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we may be able to assist in their resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation would be more conducive to that discussion.

Thank you for your email. The Duke of York has made it clear to us that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ.

It is our responsibility to deal with the various issues and procedures that arise here that will need to be addressed to enable him to do so. We should be able to deal with at least some of the minor preliminary issues in the next two weeks and we will update you on our progress once we have done so.

Regards,

Gary

Mr. Bloxsome,

Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date.

Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance.

Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch.

Regards,
