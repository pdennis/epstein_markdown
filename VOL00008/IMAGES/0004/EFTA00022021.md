Hi,

Two things:

1. The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs [redacted].

2. According to the notes of his interview with us, [redacted] said he knew but did not tell anyone that [redacted] was released or Epstein was without a cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the captain or warden to put someone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know that [redacted] was gone and denies his prior statement. Do you have a recollection of this interview? If so, [redacted] wants to know if we think the notes/MOI are correct.
