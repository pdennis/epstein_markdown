Those are the addresses I have for him. I would try Stacey, his lawyer. She is usually very responsive. Thanks for handling this !!

Hi Public Corruption Chiefs,

FYI, since the Times article came out today about Epstein’s incarceration and death, BOP has been receiving multiple new requests for the records released in the FOIA matter (ABC, CNN, MuckRack). BOP plans to respond to those requests quickly and release the same records.

One minor wrinkle: the FOIA specialist at BOP has tried to contact Mark Epstein a couple times regarding his communications from about a month ago. But so far he has not responded to her. She has asked if we have contact info for him. What I have is this phone number and these emails Mark Epstein &lt; and STACEY RICHMAN &lt; . I am going to confirm BOP has these, but please let me know if there is some other way to contact him.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
