Sigrid,

Tomorrow morning would actually be fine – we’ll send you a calendar invite for 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, including a conference line number, and we’ll plan to talk with you then. And just as a heads up, not that I particularly expect this will be necessary, but similar to how we always tell witnesses that if they want to talk with their counsel privately during an in-person meeting, we’ll let her know that the same thing holds true for over the phone as well, that you two can always have a side call at any point! And otherwise I think it will be the usual awkwardness of phone but hopefully not too bad.

thanks again,

From: Sigrid McCawley &lt;&gt;

If that does not work she also said she could do it this Monday morning – 10:00 Eastern (9:00 Texas) if that is better for your team.

Just let me know.
Thanks

Sigrid,

Thanks for getting back to us so quickly. Goes without saying that we of course would be happy for you to be on the call as well—I should have mentioned that in my initial email. On timing, let us just check with the agents on the case to see if that works for them, and we hope to be able to confirm with you in the next couple hours.

thanks,

Hello — said she has time tomorrow if that would work for you team. She is in Texas so an hour behind us. I would like to be on the call as well. Would it work to do something tomorrow at 11:00 EST? Let me know. If that does not work I can try to get other times.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of time, that would be great – and we’ll try to be as efficient as possible and hopefully take less than that. If that sounds alright?

thanks,

Hello ☐,

I am sure ☐ will be happy to help in any way she can. Let me find out what her patient schedule is like for next week and find a time that works. How much time do you think she should allot for the interview – just so she can plan?

Best,
Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

We wanted to follow up in connection with ☐ – our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any questions at all. And if ☐ is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer.

Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Thank you very much, Sigrid.

Just to confirm, does [redacted] have any journal entries regarding the time when she traveled to New Mexico? I believe she told us during our interview that she does not have any entries from that time, but I just wanted to make sure.

Thanks again,
Sigrid

Hello – attached are the pages sent me to provide to you. Here is a bit of an explanation and I also asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need anything else:

"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY trip and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the movies with him."

Best,
Sigrid

Hello,

Let me follow up with [redacted] about her journal. I know she shared some pictures with you from around the time period when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to you and will check with her to see if she has anything else that might be helpful to the investigation.

All my best,
Sigrid

Hi Sigrid,

Hope you had a wonderful holiday season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we made after interviewing [redacted] a few months ago. During her interview, [redacted] referred to several entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents [redacted] may have that relate to her experiences with Epstein and Maxwell.

EFTA00023174

Would [ ] be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may have) to assist in our investigation?

Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful.

Thank you,
