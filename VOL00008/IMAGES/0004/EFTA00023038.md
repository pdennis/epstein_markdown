Dear Sirs

A 2019 documentary, currently being shown on Netflix Canada, entitled *The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann*, is about the four year old English girl who disappeared from Portugal in 2007 while on holiday with her parents and siblings. She has never been found.

In Series 1, episode 3, Portuguese journalists refer to a scandal that took place years earlier regarding child abuse in a Portuguese orphanage. It is referred to as the *Pact of Silence*. In connection with the orphanage, *Casa Pia*, a journalist states that it is a known fact that *American millionaires* were flying into Portugal on private jets for the purpose of sexually abusing these children.

This might be a line of enquiry that you may wish to follow up.

Yours truly,
