My simple advise is to enjoy EVERY day with your loved ones, especially your children, and never take your health for granted.

We do not yet have a final version of the suicide reconstruction report, as far as I'm aware. Have you received this from BOP/MCC? If so, could you send it to us? If not, could you reach out to your contacts at BOP for the final version or an estimated completion date?

Thanks,
