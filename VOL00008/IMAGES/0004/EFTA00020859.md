Hi

Please let EOUSA know if you have checked to see if a visa is required for your destination.

View the state dept. link for the country you are traveling to visa link for the country you are traveling to.

Visa policies may be found on the Department of State's website or on the website hosted by each country's embassy.

https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country.html

Traveler, Consult EOUSA usaeo.foreign.travel@usdoi.gov mailbox to obtain a visa for you.

To provide sufficient time for the State Dept. to issue the authorization letter and for the foreign government to process the visa request, it is recommended that visa request package be submitted to EOUSA's RMP Travel.

Staff 15 business days prior to the proposed date of departure.

Thank you
