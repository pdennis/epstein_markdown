Thanks . On number #2, yes that is certainly my memory of the interview, and we included that information in the pros memo.

Hi,

Two things:

1. The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs
2. According to the notes of his interview with us, said he knew but did not tell anyone that was released or Epstein was without a cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the captain or warden to put someone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know that was gone and denies his prior statement. Do you have a recollection of this interview? If so, Lyeson wants to know if we think the notes/MOI are correct.
