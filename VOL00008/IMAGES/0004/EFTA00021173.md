Hi everyone.

Last week had some very notable achievements:

a $678 million civil settlement with Novartis for years of paying illicit kickbacks;
and also the arrest of GELANE Maxwell, a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein.

I cheer both of those the teams that worked so hard to bring those worthy cases.

Of course, some of our most important achievements happen out of the spotlight, and I want to celebrate everyone who has:
- taken on new gun cases to combat our District’s recent rise in violence;
- chipped in to skillfully handle the increase in FOIA litigation; and
- diligently prepared thoughtful responses to compassionate release motions.

And many thanks to all of our AUSAs, paralegals, and staff who are shouldering the work of the Office every day.

We miss seeing you, but even when you are out of sight, we know we are lucky to have you.

Stay safe and keep up the great work.
