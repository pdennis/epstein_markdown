Subject: New York search warrant materials

So the short answer is that the load files are not completed yet. One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. The limitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as quickly as I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration date, so that took priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load files, but the process is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK right now.

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to

list approximately 38 computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.

thanks,
