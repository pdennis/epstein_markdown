Thanks very much for speaking just now. I'm cc'ing the rest of the SDNY Epstein team, including AUSA and , as well as the lead case agents. We really appreciate your willingness to help with our prosecution and ongoing investigation.

As discussed, we would ask that any witnesses or victims who contact your office while our case is pending and our investigation is ongoing be referred to our team. Once our case is complete, we will refer any matters that were not covered by our case and that may be within your jurisdiction to your office.

Please feel free to contact any of us if any questions or issues arise, and thank you again for your help.
