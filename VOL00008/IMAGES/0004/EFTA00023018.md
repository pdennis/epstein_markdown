☐ says we are seriously out of money. That said, he also said he'll deal with the emergencies. And Maxwell is on his radar. So depending on how much money we are talking about, there will be some play in the joints.

Do you know if there is any play in the joints on this? We were hoping to hire an SDFL vendor immediately to start work on scanning the SDFL Epstein stuff and to help process the OPR Epstein stuff. Would prefer not to put that off until October if possible.

We are out of money through the end of the fiscal. Everything new will have to wait.
