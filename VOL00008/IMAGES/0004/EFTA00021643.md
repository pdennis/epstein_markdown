Following up on our phone conversation a few minutes ago, thank you for being in touch and advising us of your representation of in connection with his receipt of a grand jury subpoena, which is attached. So you have contact info for our full team, we're all reachable anytime at the copied emails or by phone at:

As we discussed on the phone, I understand you'll need to have the opportunity to speak with him further, and so it's fine for us to speak mid-next week. And as I also mentioned, we don't currently have any reason to believe that has done anything wrong; we would like to speak with him about his knowledge of and interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, particularly in connection with recent statements he has made to the press about comments Epstein made to him about Epstein's prior conduct.

Please let us know if any additional information would be helpful, and we look forward to being in touch with you next week.

thank you,
