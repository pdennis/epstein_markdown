I spoke with [redacted], and he offered me the option of this Friday or Monday (11/1) after our conference – both options would be at 500 Pearl. I offered those options to defense counsel and am waiting to hear back.

Hi [redacted],

Defense counsel has requested that we schedule an evidence inspection this week with the defendant present. We'd very much appreciate it if the marshals could produce the defendant to a proffer room this week at 500 Pearl Street. Our understanding from Eric Blachman, copied here, is that the marshals have been producing defendants for meetings of this type. A CSO and a case agent will be present for the meeting.

Could you please let us know what dates this week would work for the meeting? We are scheduling this with defense attorneys who are flying in from out of state, so would appreciate if you could let us know what dates work this week.

Thanks very much,
