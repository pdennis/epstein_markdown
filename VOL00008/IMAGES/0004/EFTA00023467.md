Not sure if we'll have time to get to this during our meeting later, but the team wanted to talk to you about some of the ESI exhibits we've marked as potential trial exhibits. They're attached. These items were found on a forensic image of a computer registered to "gmax," and the evidence would show that this is a clone of a computer in the Palm Beach house in 2005, which was taken by private investigators working for Epstein. The FBI found the cloned drives in Epstein's NYC townhouse in 2019.

We are considering whether any of these exhibits should be offered at trial under Rule 404(b). If we don't get to this during our meeting today, we can find another time to talk.

Thanks,
