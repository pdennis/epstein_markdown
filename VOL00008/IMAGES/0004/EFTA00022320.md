Ms. Maxwell has three blankets and had those blankets throughout the weekend. Although one was removed, it was in fact replaced shortly thereafter. Additionally, Ms. Maxwell was provided a holiday meal and all additional meals she is entitled to. The temperature was checked on the night of 12/26/20 and was reported to be 76.5 degrees.

Good afternoon-

I am informed that Ms. Maxwell’s blanket has been removed and that she was not

provided a complete holiday meal.

She is cold and hungry.

I am urging you to immediately provide her with blankets.

She is cold, her isolation cell is not insulated, and the temperature drops in the evening.

It is currently a freezing 32 degrees and the temperature is forecast to drop to at least 28 degrees this evening.

It is inexcusable for her to be deprived of a blanket and proper

nutrition.

Despite repeated complaints, the MDC fails to provide basic requirements to Ms. Maxwell.

I am requesting an emergency legal call with her. My number is

[Redacted]

Promptly correct these problems, which will be reported to the Court.

Thank you-

Bobbi
