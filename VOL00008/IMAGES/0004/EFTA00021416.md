Marty, Reid,

Just bumping this briefly—obviously no obligation to respond to these, but to give you an opportunity to before we file this afternoon, if you’d like, wondering if:

- There is any additional information you’re able to provide about the passport; and
- Whether you’re willing to tell us if Mr. Epstein is, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States.

thank you,

Marty, Reid,

Briefly following up on this morning, if you could please let us know what if any information you’re able to provide about the passport we discussed, with the copies we provided to you, we can address any new info as appropriate for a possible submission tomorrow.

Related, something I’m not sure we’ve specifically asked, and I’m not sure whether pretrial asked—can you please advise whether Mr. Epstein currently is, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States?

thanks,
