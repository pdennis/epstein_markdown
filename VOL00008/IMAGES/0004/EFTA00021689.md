Among the materials contained in this production is an excerpt of a flight log that former Assistant United States Attorney [redacted] received during a February 29, 2016 meeting with attorneys representing [redacted] (the “February 2016 meeting”). At the February 2016 meeting, AUSA [redacted] received copies of Jeffrey Epstein’s black book, excerpts of flight records, and certain Palm Beach Police Department reports. Epstein’s black book and the Palm Beach Police Department reports were previously produced to you on August 21, 2020, and can be found at SDNY_GM_00174731-SDNY_GM_00174827 and SDNY_GM_00174880-SDNY_GM_00174966 respectively. Today we are producing to you the version of the flight records AUSA Kramer received at the February 2016 meeting, which includes a subset of logs previously produced to you on August 5, 2020 (see SDNY_GM_00005532-SDNY_GM_00005676) as well as two additional pages that were not previously produced to you in discovery, see SDNY_GM_02742935 and SDNY_GM_02742937.

Additionally, in recognition of the Government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, we are disclosing the information below. This disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information constitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. Specifically, the Government discloses the following:

- The witness identified as witness “M” in a 2007 ex parte declaration, which you attached as Exhibit B to the Defense Pretrial Motion Number 10 for Bill of Particulars and Pre-Trial Disclosures in this case, is [redacted]. On or about November 14, 2006, [redacted] was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The notes from that interview contain the following line on page 12: “rumor is that JE is gay,” apparently referring to a rumor regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual orientation.

The Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly produce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate

EFTA00021690

to reach out if you have any difficulty accessing these materials or if you wish to arrange a time to review physical items in the FBI's custody.

Very truly yours,

AUDREY STRAUSS
United States Attorney
