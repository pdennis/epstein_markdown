Got it, that makes sense. Could you (or she) please forward us that email (and any letter, etc.) that went out, just so we have those materials and know what they say in case any attorneys call us with questions?

_________________________ is assisting in organizing this with victim services division at headquarters. Victims attorney's were already notified via brief email that they can choose either October 15th at the Miami Field Office or October 23rd in Manhattan. Our understanding is that this is primarily a victim services brief, which will not have any discussions of substantive case details or status updates. Myself and ___________________________________________________________________________________________ will be there for any victims that wish to be interviewed afterwards.

In connection with the Epstein victim services meetings, could you also let us know the date of the New York meeting, assuming it's still the plan to do a meeting in both locations?

And on the same subject, do you know when notifications are going out about those meetings, and who's coordinating that? We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any substantive update about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we don't want any victims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info.

We'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in Nashville from the 15th through the 18th for a separate work trip, but will check with ___________________________________________________________________________________________ on their schedules.

thanks,

If you have some time today we can chat about these steps at more length but in short...

1) Sure we can make a photo array but also we have a photo book which we could just add [redacted] to instead of the 6 pack.
2) [redacted] will be on vacation the first week of November but what about the week of October 14? FBI victim services is hosting the victim conference for Epstein victims in Miami on October 15 which we plan on attending. Are you guys coming to this? That might be the best week for us to knock out a few additional victim interviews, as well as meet with [redacted].
3) We have not come across any [redacted] photos from the Manhattan house yet but we will certainly keep an eye out as we continue our analysis.

A few things on next steps:

1) Could you please put together a photo array that includes [redacted]? I think we may need it for interviews with [redacted] and [redacted].
2) When I reach out to [redacted] lawyer, I'd like to discuss dates for an interview. [redacted] is in Florida, so we could sync this up with interviews of [redacted], all in one trip. Would the first week of November work for you guys?
3) I'm aware of the [redacted] photos from the Florida house, but if you could please let us know if you seized any from the Manhattan house, that would be great, thanks. Likewise, if her name is on any of the discs seized from Florida or NY please let us know.
