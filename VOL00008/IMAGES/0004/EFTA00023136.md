&gt; Kate,
&gt;
&gt; Would it work to plan to have a call tomorrow at 3:00? That would give us about a day to review and internally discuss. Or if that timing doesn't work on your side, please let us know -- we're flexible on timing, especially since it's a weekend and given all the circumstances.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,

&gt; Sorry for the delay -- we plan to send you a revised draft submission in the early afternoon today. After you have had a chance to review, can we discuss? Either later today, or perhaps more realistically over the weekend?
&gt; Thanks, Kate

&gt; I know we were bandying about the idea of a zoom discussion yesterday but I'm actually going to be away from a computer this afternoon -- alright to do a call-in to the same conference number as yesterday?
