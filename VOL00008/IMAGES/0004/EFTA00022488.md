Hey

Following up on our call just now, I have corrected my prior misrecollection – the records reflecting calls from  to  are from AT&amp;T, not Cingular. I've attached the relevant AT&amp;T records for your reference. The specific calls to  are on April 23, 2004 and May 2, 2004 and are located on pages 9 and 12 of the attached records.  number at that time was , and it appears in the "Number Called" column for entries on those two dates.

I've updated the order of proofer to reflect that we need an AT&amp;T custodian (instead of Cingular/T-Mobile).

Thanks!
