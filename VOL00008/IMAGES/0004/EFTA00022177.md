Let's put this language in our letter! Maybe in the paragraph I added at the end about checking ID's at the door? I think this is an important point.

First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant's and Epstein's interactions with Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor victims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately transported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct: there is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed.

Because a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not matter whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements of the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65.

Sure thing. The discussion starts on page 184 of the PDF (157 of the pagination).

Hey,

Attached is Judge Nathan's first decision denying the pretrial motions. The (very brief) discussion of MV-3 starts on page 26.

Thanks,
