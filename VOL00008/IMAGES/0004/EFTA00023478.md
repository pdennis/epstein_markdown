Counsel,

We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you today. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production will be made via USAfx.

We will send a CD with the new production to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. If you would prefer that she receive the production on a drive, we can either request that the MDC send us one of the drives back to load with the production, or we can load a new drive if you would like to provide us with one.

Thanks,
