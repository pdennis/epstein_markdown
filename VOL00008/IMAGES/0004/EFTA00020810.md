Thanks so much for putting this together. Some suggestions/thoughts in the attached. I'm also attaching the brief that sent me which has a couple of case cites on pages 4-5. I'm happy to take another look later if helpful. , I think you should also review this.

Feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Hey team,

Attached is a draft MIL for pseudonyms. I'm going to churn out the sympathy MIL tomorrow and then do a heavy edit of the whole doc, which hopefully will make it shorter and tee it up for .

Safe flight tomorrow, and good luck in California!
