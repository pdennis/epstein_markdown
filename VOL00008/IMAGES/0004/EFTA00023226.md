Nick and I need to compile the witness statements anyway in the next week or so, so we will do that and send you all of the inmate notes, and the relevant MCC employee notes (who talked about the July 23 attempt).

No deadline. I'm also happy to make this as easy as possible for you guys, if you want to give me access to the drive and point me to the interview folder. We obviously won't produce anything without running it by you, but don't want this to be any extra work for you guys.

Just a bail application. We interviewed a lot of people so this isn't a particularly quick request. Do you have a deadline?

Hey guys – just following up, though it sounds like you're busy with defendants fleeing...

Subject: Tartaglione / Epstein

Hey Guys – we continue to get requests from the Tartaglione defense team related to the Epstein investigation. In light of a recent request, can we please review your notes from inmates in the SHU on the date of the attempted suicide to determine if there are any inmates who gave statements that corroborate Tartaglione’s account that he saved Epstein’s life? We think this could arguably be penalty-phase Brady, so we’d like to review this in the first instance, and then discuss with you any disclosures we think need to be made.
