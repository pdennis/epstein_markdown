Importance: Normal

represents David Rogers, pilot for Epstein
- served with a subpoena

Lankler has spoken with Rogers

Thoughts on where he's at? Rogers is more than happy to be cooperative, doesn't believe he has much significant information

Before 2006, instances where people on the plane were a minor, after 2006, doesn't believe that was the case anymore
- cooperated with the FBI as part of the Florida investigations
- beyond that doesn't believe he has additional useful information
- he flies with a co-pilot, no staff / stewardess
- everybody appears to be an adult, post-2006
