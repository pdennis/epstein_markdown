Colleen,

Per our discussion – the protective order is attached, as are the Court’s opinion on this as well as the Government’s strong argument on these issues.

Colleen,

We are happy to speak with you – we had only followed up because we were under the impression she was interested in speaking with us. We certainly can discuss issues of witness safety and confidentiality, but we also are not looking to pressure anyone, at all. Please let us know if it makes sense to chat, and if so, what time ranges would work for you later this week or next.

thanks,

Colleen,

Thanks very much for being in touch, and we would like to speak with Ms. [Redacted]. As a threshold question, would it be possible for you to share with us the documents from and email correspondence with Maxwell referenced in your email below? And is there a good date or dates later in July that would work for a phone or videoconference interview?

thanks again,

We wanted to follow up on our prior email and offer to speak with our client [Redacted]. As stated earlier, Ms. [Redacted] worked for Ms. Maxwell (and, by extension, Jeffrey Epstein).

I confirmed with our client that she is willing to speak with you and wants to fully cooperate with the criminal investigation/action pending against Ms. Maxwell. She could be a valuable witness for you. Please let us know if you would like to speak with our client. We are happy to facilitate this conversation.

Best,

Colleen

Hi [Redacted]

As we discussed last week, our client [Redacted] has in her possession documents from and email correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell. Thus far, we have received authorization to share the list of office numbers Ms. [Redacted] used during her employment with Ghislaine Maxwell from 2003-2007. Please see attached.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Teri,

Thanks for being in touch. In the first instance, before we would request an interview directly, it would be helpful for us to get a full attorney proffer from you about what the

EFTA00023322</wrote></wrote></wrote>

client's information is, what you expect she would convey in an interview, any relevant documentary or other corroborating materials, etc. That way we can make sure we're not re-victimizing any individual unnecessarily, and be efficient with any necessary follow-up interview of the individual him- or herself. Please let us know when a good time would be for an attorney proffer? And we can figure out scheduling.

thanks very much,
