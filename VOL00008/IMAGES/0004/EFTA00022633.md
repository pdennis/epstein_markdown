Below is an email I received from someone who has a radio broadcast in USVI. He's investigating (what he believes is) an ambulance which operated out of Epstein's compound. Just forwarding along, FWIW. Thanks.

Mr. &lt;

Thank you for the reply. On the Ambulance issue I confirmed through Ms. &lt; &gt; at USVI EMS the following.

1. The vehicle has no registration of any kind. Required are Certificate of Need, ALS and BLS certification, Medical Director, Protocols, Staff providing care need to be USVI certified. These are huge violations of law. None of these requirements we even attempted to be obtained.

2. To import a vehicle of this type, the above requirements need to be in compliance. No record if it's importation is on record with USVI EMS. This could mean
A. Some corruption in customs allowed its importation.
Or
B. It was smuggled via shipping container.

3. It holds a USVI license plate. Registering a vehicle of this type would be impossible, considering the above items. It was however able to obtain a tag from BMV.

We confirmed through FDLE the vehicle was NOT listed on his Sex Offender Registration as his many other vehicles are.

I will attach several screen shots of drone video we obtained from YouTube channel Rusty Shackleford. In the final picture the Ambulance appears to have been moved or removed from the property.

This is Ms. &lt; &gt; email &lt; &gt;

I gave her yours also. I believe they are doing an official investigation and would be glad to cooperate. I am available if I can be of any further help.

Our viewers, and I think the public in general, are not happy with what happened with Epstein. As I'm sure SDNY is not. The questions we hear most, and are trying to answer with factual information are:

EFTA00022633

1. Is this video an official raid?
2. Why did it take so long?
3. Has this, and all his properties been searched and seized?

Answers to these questions would do much to restore the public's confidence in the investigation, as well as those victims yet to come forward. A statement from SDNY would be welcomed.

Do you think a statement will be forthcoming? If so when? Thank you again for your time and attention. Godspeed with the Epstein case.

PS: You might have already done this, but the Rusty Shackleford videos showed a lot of activity going on prior to the raid. Think this would be valuable if evidence was being removed or destroyed.

Mr. [REDACTED],

Per our phone conversation please send us a statement (press release) on the recent Task Force raid on LSJ. We also had a question about the seizure of that property. Just a reminder about the Ambulance. We have a source with USVI EMS who states this is an unregistered vehicle operating illegally, that possibly was smuggled into USVI. We have a decent bit of information we would be happy to share with SDNY about this.

Warmest Regards,
