Hey

Attached is a draft Paul Kane Q&amp;A. There are a couple questions that may seem weird – basically, since PCS didn't create this record, the questions are aimed at a line of Second Circuit cases holding that "Records maintained but not created by a company may be admissible as business records of that company if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into [the] company's records and relied upon in its day-to-day operations." United States v. Kuthuru, 665 F. App'x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2016).

Let's chat about the other hearsay issue when you have a minute?

Thanks!
