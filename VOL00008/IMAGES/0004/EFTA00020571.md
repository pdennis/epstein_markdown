Q: When Jeffrey Epstein died, a lot of people asked what's next? Is the government going to hold people who are accused of helping him recruit these younger girls, participated in this, can you give us a little bit of an update of where your office is in this investigation?

A: Well, I'll note that the original charges against Jeffrey Epstein contained a conspiracy charge and we alleged that there were conspirators involved. And Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others and I can assure you that our investigation is moving forward.
