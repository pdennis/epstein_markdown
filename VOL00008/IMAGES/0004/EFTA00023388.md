Hi all,

and I circled up in advance of the meeting tomorrow. I plan to attend in person, and I think will as well, so maybe we could meet up in person at 1StA's around 3:30/3:45 to speak before the meeting? If so, please let me know where would work best for that.

Thanks,

Great, thanks . , do you guys mind conferring about what's in the production that's likely to become noteworthy/of interest, and then we can have a brief pre-meeting on Monday to discuss? just wants a brief overview of what we're producing and the greatest hits of what's likely to become newsworthy. Thanks very much.

BOP is in the loop, but I do not know how far up it has gone for this round. For earlier issues in the case, I think we went up to the GC. I can confirm with the FOIA Specialist I've primarily been working with there how far it has gone this time. (She is in Central Office, not MCC.) I know she went up with one specific issue recently about the production, so I assume folks there no the whole thing is going out.

I have not been in touch with the Estate at any point, and see no reason to do that. If we were going to reach out to them, I'd like to clear that with folks on the Civil side.

I've been in touch with [redacted] at OIG (told him about the extension today).

Thanks,

Defer to [redacted] on this. But to the extent it is relevant, on Noel/Thomas's counsel, they know about the FOIA litigation because we produced some materials to them that were collected after the FOIA action was initiated, so I could easily give them a call or email on this. The Noel/Thomas team hasn't been giving any updates to the Estate.

[redacted] asked whether there was any other constituency that we should notify about the upcoming release that hasn't already been notified (she suggested BOP or Epstein's estate). [redacted], how high up BOP have you been briefing about this? And as far as Epstein's estate, we haven't provided notice of anything thus far, correct? I don't see a reason to do so, and same for Noel/Thomas counsel, but let me know if either of you guys disagree. Thanks.

All,

Per the attached, the Court granted the one-week extension in the Epstein FOIA. So the production is now due next Friday, July 2. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with that date.

Please also let me know if you need anything else from me in terms of the processes we discussed yesterday. We are working with BOP to finalize the production, but please let me know if I should take steps beyond that (e.g., letting additional people know about the production, etc.).

EFTA00023389

Also, does anyone want to see the production before it goes out?

Thanks,

Hi all,

The Times consented to the one-week request. I think it is likely the Court will approve it. I plan to file the attached letter, which includes the changes we discussed on the phone, around 6:30. Please let me know if you have any issues or concerns. I'll let you know as soon as the Court rules.

Thanks,

Hi all,

We now have a 5:45 call scheduled with the Times. Please let me know before then if there's any other info I can share with them. I'm attaching a draft extension request letter here for review. Please let me know if this looks okay, or if we need to discuss anything,

Hi all,

I just spoke with [REDACTED], who spoke with [REDACTED]. I can make this request, but I am not sure it will be successful. Before I speak to the Times about it, I need to know a little bit more info about what I can share with the Times and what is

Hi

We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by , and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which were just completed, to confirm we agree they've fulfilled that requirement of their deferred prosecution agreements. She's going to speak with , about it as well. Is this doable?
