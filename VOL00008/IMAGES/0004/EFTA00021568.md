Hey

Did you add the redaction on page 117? (It may have been there from an old version this morning.) Either way, since it now quotes from the public Second Circuit docket, I think we don't need to redact that bit.

Will, I caught a nit in the first sentence of V.C.I – it says “Ex. 10 14:9” instead of “Ex. 10 at 14:9.”

Otherwise, I am pencils down! (Maurene, if you still think it’s useful to create a public, redacted version of the July depo, I can do that quickly while you finalize.)

Thanks,

Hey — would you send me the working doc when you have a second? I’m just taking a quick look at the redactions, no textual changes are coming!
