Dean

I'm an investigative reporter at The Norwegian Business Daily in Oslo, (Dagens Næringsliv). We have been writing about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get Bill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has been the former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rød-Larsen, who resigned as president of the International Peace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching our translated articles.

The reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've heard that You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be grateful if we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We have reason to believe that both Mr. Rød-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during Christmas to Epstein's island in the years 2010-2015.

I'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website.
