Dear Mr. Epstein:

I hope you have seen the program and other materials for the 2005 North American regional meeting coming up on November 4-6 in Montreal. We have not heard from you about attending and want to be sure you are aware of the meeting and have had a chance to consider attending. To that end, I attach the program and a reservation form.

Please let us know if you can attend or not. Just reply to this email or send in a completed reservation form.

Thanks,
Michael O'Neil
