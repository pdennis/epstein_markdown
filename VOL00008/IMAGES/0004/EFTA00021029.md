Hi team,

Today we need to docket our proposed redactions to our Motion to Quash (see Dkt. No. 473), we and the defense are required to docket our letters on the birth certificates issue (see Dkt. No. 474), and we and the defense need to docket our letters on GX 52 (see Dkt. No. 476).

We already redacted the birth certificates letters. I've attached:

- Our motion to quash, which I don't think needs any redactions
- The remaining GX-52 letters, for which I've proposed redactions
- A draft letter to the Court

Would one of you three quickly take a look, and then I'll coordinate with the defense?

Thanks.
