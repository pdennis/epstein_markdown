[REDACTED] – We have not been able to connect yet. I'm at my desk for the next 1.5 hours if that works for Agent Mike

Hi Mike,

Thanks for following up, and I asked Agent [REDACTED] to reach out to you – I think she may have left a message. Let me know if you and she aren't able to connect up by the end of the day? If you're still not by then, I can try to set up a specific time.

thanks,

[REDACTED]
