Subject: RE: Brunel

Thank you very much for letting us know. It sounds like this went very well. We are in the process of drafting an MLA request and will get it to you ASAP. I can reach out to the lawyer for the two adult witnesses to inquire about their openness to speaking with the French. Asking the French to propose search terms sounds like a good next step as well.

Subject: Brunel

Dear all:

My meeting on Brunel went well this afternoon. Here is the quick read out:

General Points

- There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual...and suggests its importance for them.
- They can hold Brunel for 18 months initially, but with a neutral judge’s approval, can likely keep him for up to 3-4 years while the investigation continues.
- They did not flag any known critical points in the near future that would result in press coverage...but you never know what will happen (he will likely ask for release, which would catch some press if so).
- Right out of the gate, the lead judge expressed concern about confidentiality (in part because a long article about their investigation appeared in a Paris newspaper yesterday). She expressed her expectation that our discussions and cooperation would remain confidential.

U.S. Sharing with France

- They are interested in your assistance in contacting the lawyer for the two adult victims, to see if the victims would be willing to speak with them.
- They are already in touch with lawyer for [REDACTED], so no more is needed there.
- They are very interested in obtaining records/images from the your database created from the searches of the Epstein residences/devices. They are willing to provide search terms, and can work to narrow the range (they are interested to know how to best formulate search terms to take advantage of the platform the records are on (i.e., can they do proximity searches, is facial recognition available to identify Brunel, etc.). The idea was also proposed of potentially doing a more narrow search now, followed by a potentially more expansive search for relevant data after your trial...when the SDNY/FBI bandwith might increase and confidentiality concerns might be less acute.
- In addition to the database, they wonder if there are transcripts or reports of witness interviews that you would be willing to provide, that bear on Brunel.
- In the same vein, they were interested to know if Maxwell talked to FBI post-arrest and if she said anything of potential interest to them (I told them I doubt it, but said I would ask you).

EFTA00021721

- In terms of the confidentiality of the records you would produce, they would be put in the file, and available to the defense and civil parties...but they are strict limits to the circumstances in which they would have access to the information, and it may even be able to be placed under seal...which would apparently not preclude defense access, but would make it very difficult for the defense to access the info.
- They are interested to know if you might expand your investigation to other accomplices/co-conspirators.
- They might be interested in a direct dialogue with you, but only if it were a useful exercise (they were less enthusiastic than I expected about this)

## France Sharing with U.S.

- They responded positively regarding your interest in connecting with [redacted], who is represented by counsel. They indicated a willingness to assist on the basis of an MLAT request sent through normal channels.
- But here's the important part: they made it quite clear that they are not going to help SDNY unless we show a good faith effort to help them, and begin sending evidence their way. The sharing needs to be reciprocal, in other words.

## Path Forward

- I'd propose that you draft the MLAT request for [redacted], and that we get it into translation ASAP. In the meantime, I will invite them to send narrowed search terms, and you can contact the lawyer for the two adult victims...but let me know your thoughts.

[redacted]

This looks accurate to me, thanks very much. One point you might want to add regarding our searches is that we also gathered a large number of photographs, including photos that feature Brunel. Again, if they can narrow their request, we would be open to sharing certain images if that would be useful to them.

Thanks,

Further to our call yesterday, here are the points I plan to make at my meeting tomorrow. Thanks in advance for letting me know if you see any errors, omissions, or additions to make:

3 Ways DOJ Can Offer to Help Advance the French Case

- Willing to connect French authorities with attorney for [redacted]:

EFTA00021722

- DOJ has awareness of two non-French adult victims who were abused in Paris in relation to Epstein; neither allege specific illegal conduct involving Brunel, one of them definitely met Brunel at some point. DOJ is willing to ask their lawyer if the victims would be willing to speak with French authorities.
- DOJ executed searches at two Epstein residences (in NYC and the USVI), searched devices, and has created a significant database of data relating to Epstein. If French authorities can provide more targeted search terms, DOJ would be willing to review those results to identify records that can be provided to French authorities regarding Brunel.

## Info to Obtain from French

- Are French authorities targeting others besides Brunel?
- What is the anticipated timeline of the investigation/prosecution; and are there any critical steps that would result in press attention in the near term (i.e., before summer 2021);

- Assistance from French in contacting/speaking with her...with awareness that matter is time sensitive given upcoming trial;
- Assistance in obtaining records from French authorities (including prior interviews) pertinent to her;
- Is she represented by counsel?
- DOJ available to her/her counsel to discuss how we inform/protect victims and victim information (as part of general victim-centric approach to this case).
