Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we've received, with just a note that it doesn't appear to include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

thanks,

☐ I've updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now received. Would you take a look when you can?

☐ I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized the new stuff we're looking to share?

Thanks,
