We are on a 25% work schedule in the office. I have sent an email to [REDACTED] to see if she can drive in and find the document in question. I expect she will check her email in the morning, so I'll let you know then. You should hear something before 12:00 p.m.

Good luck.

Hi [REDACTED].

Yes, this would be included in the files you provided, but unfortunately, we have been having a lot of trouble reviewing the scans that were provided to us by the vendor. Our tech folks are still working out the bugs, so we are not able to quickly look for this document. We'd be very grateful if [REDACTED] would be able to pull just this document and send it to us, please.

Thanks very much,

Hi [REDACTED]:

I reached out to [REDACTED] about this, who has been keeping track of these files. Isn't this something that you all would have a copy of from when you scanned our files? Just trying to track it down.

Hi [REDACTED].

Hope you're doing well. We have a small follow-up question about the Jeffrey Epstein file. I'm attaching a privilege log filed by your office in connection with the CVRA lawsuit. We were hoping you might be able to send us the item on page 5 of the log, which has the following description: [REDACTED]

The log gives the following identifiers for the document: "Box #1 P-003679 Thru P-003680."

Thanks very much – we're currently briefing an issue relating to this, so we really appreciate your help.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
[REDACTED]
