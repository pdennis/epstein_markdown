Separate from the below, at the conference today I neglected to ask the court to exclude speedy trial time until Thursday, which I'm going to ask for in a letter this evening—could you please let us know if you consent?

Marty, Reid,

Briefly following up on this morning, if you could please let us know what if any information you're able to provide about the passport we discussed, with the copies we provided to you, we can address any new info as appropriate for a possible submission tomorrow.

Related, something I'm not sure we've specifically asked, and I'm not sure whether pretrial asked—can you please advise whether Mr. Epstein currently is, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States?

thanks,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
Southern District of New York
