Hi,

Happy to—I am away this weekend but I have my personal laptop and can remote in sometime tomorrow.

Provided I'm able to download it, I should be able to review, and I'll let you know if that doesn't work for some reason.

I've divided up the remainder of Epstein's iPhone into three chunks. It's taking the videos. There's one chunk (containing four chats, audio files, documents, voicemails, and recordings) that I'm hoping you would be able to review tomorrow. I've saved that chunk here on the share: \\Usa.doi.gov\cloud\NYS\STAndrews\Shared\USvEpstein-2018R01618\FOR AM

Any chance you could please review this chunk tomorrow please? In the meantime, and I'm working through all of the images.

Thanks so much,
