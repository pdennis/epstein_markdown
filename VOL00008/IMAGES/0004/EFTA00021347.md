Any day next week works for me. Also in my role as Learned Counsel, and in full compliance with the ABA Guidelines, I will be submitting a proposed schedule for penalty phase pleadings over the weekend.

Thanks

I think we will be ready to propose a schedule sometime early next week. Is there a day and time when you can meet to discuss? We will send you a proposed briefing schedule ahead of the meeting. I hope to have ours finalized no later than Tuesday.
