Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly.

We expect to ask Mr. [redacted] about his interactions with [redacted], the U.S. Customs and Border Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. [redacted] listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. [redacted] met and interacted with [redacted], the nature of those interactions, and any interactions [redacted] may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. [redacted] knowledge).

Best,

Sorry for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on Thursday, 11/12.

Let us know if anything in that range will work.

So as to make sure Mr. [redacted]'s prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover?

Thanks,
Glen

Glen,

As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. [REDACTED] via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. [REDACTED] would be available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours at most.

Thanks,

Hi Glen,
Not a problem at all -- I've added everyone to the calendar invitation. Please let us know if any other tech issues crop up, and we'd be happy to work through them.
Thanks,

Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday’s meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, Danielle and Mr. [redacted] but also Josh Morrissey who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go for our meeting.

Thanks,
Glen
