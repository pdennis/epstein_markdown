Definitely feel free to kick him to us in the first instance if that's preferable, and yeah, the two of us and ______. His firm generally represents a handful of people (most prominently ______, but others as well) but we've primarily been dealing with Florida-based partner Sigrid McCawley and hadn't yet heard from Matt. Thanks.

Who does he represent again? I'm inclined to tell him to talk to the case team in the first instance, unless you guys would prefer us to be involved up front.

And remind me, ______ is on the team and should be included in emails? Anyone else at this point?

Do either of you guys or the appropriate other person have 2 minutes to discuss a somewhat time-sensitive, but by no means urgent, Epstein-related forfeiture question in the next few days?
