Thanks [redacted]. I think this same attorney called the FBI, so I've copied [redacted] so we are all on the same page. I will contact this attorney and discuss next steps.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: Victim Reports Against Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)

Dear [redacted]

The Bloom Firm represents two women who allege they were fraudulently recruited and enticed by Epstein and/or his agents to perform a personal massage on him at his private residence, located at 9 East 71st St., New York, NY 10021, in exchange for hundreds of dollars that resulted in Epstein forcefully sexually assaulting our clients in what we believe is in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a) and (b). Our clients believe they were assaulted

EFTA00021530

by Epstein in or around June 2004. Our clients did not consent or agree to any sexual touching or activity with Mr. Epstein. Our clients are also concerned, after learning about the pictures recovered from Mr. Epstein's home, that sexually explicit pictures were unknowingly taken of them during the incidents.

Our clients' names are [redacted]. Please be advised, our clients wish to remain anonymous at this juncture and do not consent to their names being released to the public. Please advise immediately if it appears as if our clients' identities will be released to the public and/or Mr. Epstein's legal team. If revealing the identities is necessary for the case to move forward, please advise prior to doing so, so that our clients can make an informed decision.

We understand your office may be interested in interviewing our clients for additional details. We can help coordinate a time for you to interview our clients in New York.

Please let us know if you need any additional information at this time; otherwise, we look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Colleen
