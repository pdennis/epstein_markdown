I think so, but we are going to chat today or tomorrow and we will know more after that.

It will get done. No reason not to.

Can you commit to getting us a proposed schedule by October 4 (the end of next week), and we can meet later the following week?

Good morning,

We are still working internally on a proposed schedule. Can we circle back to you on a week or two? We should still have plenty of time to meet and hopefully agree on dates before our next status conference.

Any day next week works for me. Also in my role as Learned Counsel, and in full compliance with the ABA Guidelines, I will be submitting a proposed schedule for penalty phase pleadings over the weekend.

Thanks

I think we will be ready to propose a schedule sometime early next week. Is there a day and time when you can meet to discuss? We will send you a proposed briefing schedule ahead of the meeting. I hope to have ours finalized no later than Tuesday.
