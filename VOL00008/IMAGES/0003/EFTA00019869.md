Looking forward to meeting with you and [redacted] at your office tomorrow at 9:30am. As we've previously discussed, I'm attaching a trial subpoena requiring [redacted] to testify at our trial, which is scheduled to begin on November 29, 2021. I expect we will call [redacted] to testify sometime in early December 2021 during that trial.

After our prep tomorrow, I do not think we will need to meet with [redacted] again until we get closer to trial. I'll plan to reach back out in early November to arrange for a VTC on which we can conduct a refresher prep session and to arrange for [redacted] travel and hotel for trial.

Thanks and see you tomorrow.

Best,

[redacted]
