Hi

Attached is a request for a witness to travel to SDNY for trial prep in the Maxwell case later this month. The meeting is on the morning of August 20th, and the witness is hoping to fly up the day before hand and fly home the same day of our meeting.

Thanks very much, and hope you have a nice weekend!
