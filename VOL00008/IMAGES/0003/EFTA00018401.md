First I’m hearing about it assuming it’s even true - [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] may know more.

hi all
so we have been told that Deutsche Bank controls several billion in assets belonging to Financial Trust Company on behalf of Epstein's customers. We are told that up until his arrest Epstein was trading currencies through Deutsche for his client. We are told that Deutsche is considering going into bankruptcy court to take control of these assets and is coordinating its efforts with your office. can you give me any guidance on this for our story
