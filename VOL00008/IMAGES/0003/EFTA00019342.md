Probably – although her posture is different now that she is the principal subject; she may think the chances of being charged have gone up and want to talk us out of it.

I can’t conceive of her being willing to come in with no protection at all if she wasn’t willing to come in under a proffer agreement.

I ran into Geoff this morning, and he said he’d like to meet this afternoon – I think around 230 or 3, does that work? FYI, he sounds more bullish than I think we were thinking, so there may need to be some expectations managing.
