Subject: Confirming FBI numbers for Epstein devices
Date: Sun, 25 Oct 2020 20:43:39 +0000
Attachments: 2020-06-26, search_warrant, 20_mag_6719.pdf; Spreadsheet_of_Epstein_Electronic_Devices_in_SWs.xlsx

Attached is a spreadsheet of all the devices we have listed in a warrant for the Epstein/Maxwell cases. Based on information from both of you and from [redacted] I've compiled the FBI 18 number, barcode number, and CART number for each device. For your reference, I'm also attaching the June 2020 warrant, which includes 62 of these devices. The other three devices are contained in the draft warrant I sent on Friday. Would you please confirm that all of the numbers in this spreadsheet are accurate?

Once you have confirmed the accuracy of this chart, we plan to provide a version of the chart to Maxwell's attorneys. Please feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Thanks.
