Subject: Conference Information

Date: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 20:00:35 +0000

Importance: Normal

Good afternoon,

After calling 1-800-648-8411 for general conference information, the young lady there suggested that I email you as the conference coordinator.

I am a special agent with the Miami Division/West Palm Beach Office of the FBI. The phone number below, 561-833-7517, is the main office number in West Palm Beach, and Miami's office number is 305-944-9101. (The switchboard operators at either number can verify my identity.)

I am trying to locate the financial and /or investment conference that two individuals attended in New Orleans between approximately 1998-2000 and what hotels your conference would have used during those time periods. I believe your conference may be the one I am looking for.

I am trying to determine if the following two individuals attended the New Orleans Investment Conference between 1998-2000;

1. Jeffrey Epstein
2. [REDACTED]

Any information or assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

SA [REDACTED] J. [REDACTED]
