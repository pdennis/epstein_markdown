Hi [Redacted] - With apologies I now have a childcare issue in the morning. Any chance we could chat in the afternoon instead? I could do anything from 1-2 or after 3. Just let me know if anything in either window works for you. Thanks, and apologies for the late change - [Redacted]

Of course. Why don’t you call me ([Redacted]) at your convenience around 9:30 am? If another time works better, just let me know.

Hi [Redacted] - I hope this finds you well. Do you have some time to connect early next week on this matter? If there’s a good time Monday morning, in particular, please let us know. Thanks, [Redacted]
