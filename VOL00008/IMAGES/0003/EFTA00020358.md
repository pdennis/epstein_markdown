Chris, Mark, and Jeff,

We are writing to let you know that the FBI arrested your client this morning in Bradford, New Hampshire. I have attached the indictment and arrest warrant, which we are providing to you as a courtesy while we seek the formal unsealing of the indictment at SDNY this morning. We will let you know when a district judge is assigned at SDNY. The defendant is currently being transported for arrest processing by the FBI, and our current expectation is that she will be presented this afternoon in the District of New Hampshire, via remote proceedings. We will update you as we learn more.

[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and I are available for a call later this morning, if that would be useful. Please let us know what time would be convenient for you.

Thanks,

[REDACTED]
