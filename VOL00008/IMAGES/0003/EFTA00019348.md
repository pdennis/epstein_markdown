Additionally, based on the fact that during the interview with SIS staff Epstein indicated that he does not feel threatened by Tartaglione, and he has a new cell mate whom he get along with it cannot be determined that Epstein safety is in jeopardy at MCC New York.

## Recommendation:

Based on the information received and the fact that Epstein, Jeffrey; Reg. No. [redacted] indicated that he does not feel threatened by Tartaglione, Nicholas; Reg. No. [redacted] there are no CIMS Assignment of Separations warranted at this time.

On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate Epstein, Jeffrey lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide watch.

Upon the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

SUBJECT: Possible Suicide Attempt

On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate Epstein, Jeffrey [redacted] lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. His neck was red with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, "Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer [redacted] who stated that inmate Epstein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, Tartaglione, Nicholas [redacted] had attempted to kill him and had been harassing him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this matter.

I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas [redacted] who stated that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon further questioning, inmate Tartaglione stated that he sleeps on the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud.

Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could report it. , that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staff's arrival. He stated that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care.

Duty medical, Dr. was notified and briefed. It was determined no further medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM.

Upon the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up. He stated that this has been going on for a week.

SUBJECT: Epstein, Jeffrey I/M# [Redacted]

At approximately 1:27AM, I responded to a radio transmission asking for staff assistance on 9 South (Special Housing Unit). Once I was granted access to said unit I made my way to the location (M Tier) in which the disturbance stemmed from. I was told by Officer W. [Redacted] that Epstein, Jeffrey I/M# [Redacted] has attempted to hang himself. Upon arrival to cell number 124 in which he was housed, I noticed J.

Now that I am inside of the cell I notice that J. Epstein I/M# [Redacted] was snoring on the floor of his cell, he appeared to be asleep. We made several verbal commands for him to wake up and attempted to get him to his feet but they were all unsuccessful. After said attempts Lt. [Redacted] asked for a stretcher to be retrieve to safely remove him out of his cell. Once the stretcher arrived, Officer D. [Redacted], Officer J. [Redacted] and I lifted J. Epstein I/M# [Redacted] off the floor and placed him on the stretcher. Once we secured him safely on the stretcher, Officer D. [Redacted] and I lifted J.
