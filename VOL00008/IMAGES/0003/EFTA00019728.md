Subject: New York search warrant materials

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 38 computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.

thanks,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
