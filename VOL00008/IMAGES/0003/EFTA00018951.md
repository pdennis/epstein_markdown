That's an extremely expansive question. As one example, just from our research into his trafficking-related cases, we identified more than 30 attorneys who have represented him (in connection with at least 20 cases in federal court alone). Similarly, e.g., at just Deutsche Bank he had more than 60 separate accounts. From his AmEx records, he paid for nearly 5,000 flights for individuals (many repeating, obviously, but still) in the past ten years. Etc.

As a threshold reference, see the attached spreadsheet, particularly the "Witnesses and CCs" and "Epstein attys" tabs. On bank accounts, see the attached Deutsche Bank index spreadsheet with 2,000 rows of account (and relevant individuals) information. On associated individuals, a useful reference may be AmEx records, particularly the "AIRLINE" tab; that document is much too large to send via email, but I've put a copy in the following folder that Nick you have access to:

In terms of people who would (or would potentially be able to) send money on his behalf, I think the likeliest individuals would be Darren Indyke, Jeffrey Schantz, and/or

Obviously please let us know if you intend to contact or interview anyone in his world, and of course let us know if any additional information would be helpful.

thanks,

Hi,

Do you folks have a list of current known associates of Epstein? Anyone, including an attorney or some other agent, who he might communicate with, or who would send money on his behalf? Names, phone numbers, or bank accounts would be helpful. Thanks!
