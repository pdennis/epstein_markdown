Hi Joe,

That's no problem at all. In fact, our schedule for next week is in flux right now, so we will be in touch over the next days to either confirm that new time or to discuss rescheduling. Apologies for the uncertainty, and thanks for being flexible.

Hi

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon (anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is already set, and will work around it.

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

Thanks, much appreciated. If possible, it would be helpful to hold August 14th for a meeting, and we'll follow up to firm up plans as we get closer. If there are any conflicts with that date, please let us know, we're happy to be flexible.

Regarding the passport, thanks for flagging the issue, and we appreciate the effort to be transparent. [REDACTED] is free to obtain a passport and travel as she wishes—there are no restrictions on her travel from our perspective, although we very much appreciate the advance notice.

Thanks,

Hi [REDACTED],

I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does [REDACTED]. September is a busy month with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I will do everything to be as flexible as possible.

[REDACTED], now a U.S. citizen, does not have a U.S. passport. Occasionally, she has to travel for work and she is concerned about having to travel to visit her parents in the event of a family emergency. She also has some travel plans over the holidays (she cancelled a recent trip due to the current circumstances). She asked me to discuss with you whether it was appropriate to apply for a passport, as she wants to be fully transparent with the Government. She understands the likely need to postpone/cancel any personal travel plans for the time being.

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with [redacted], we were wondering if you could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer vacation plans).

We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance it would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes.

Thanks,

Good afternoon,

It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. In light of the recent filing and media reports, [redacted] wanted me to clarify her compensation with you. Aside from her regular salary, she did receive payments from Epstein in 2004 (to cover gym membership and English classes), as well as a lump sum payment of cash during 2005 (less than $10k). Epstein also paid for meals, salon appointments, clothing, etc. while she was working for him in 2005. You will not find any lump sum payments made once she terminated her employment.

As always, feel free to contact me at any time if we can be of further assistance. Look forward to meeting again.

-Joe
