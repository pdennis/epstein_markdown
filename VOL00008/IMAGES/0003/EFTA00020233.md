Good Evening,

SA [redacted] has identified each of these names on the attached spreadsheet as victims in the original case against Jeffrey Epstein. Included in the attached document is victim contact information as well as attorney information regarding representation and contact information. This is a comprehensive list.

Lastly, would you be able to send your draft language for the VNS notifications?

Thank you,

Good Morning,

I hope each of you had a good weekend. Please find language below that has been approved by FBI NY, VSD executive management and our OGC rep. I'm more than happy to have a call if you would like to discuss.

The FBI's Victim Services Division (VSD) is committed to providing services and support to victims of crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein. Though this particular indictment is focused on specific individuals, you are still entitled to your rights, resources, and referrals as a federal victim independent of this indictment. An overview of these services is available at www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services. If you would like to speak with a Victim

Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights to victim services and referrals, please email victimservices@fbi.gov.

Thank you,

Program Manager
FBI Victim Services Division
