Subject: reporter query about Epstein

I'm writing about the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein, and I wonder if the government it plans to pursue the Palm Beach property. I'm trying to reconcile the mention forfeiture of "any property" with the lack of a specific mention of the address or legal description of the El Brillo Way real estate.

Thanks.
