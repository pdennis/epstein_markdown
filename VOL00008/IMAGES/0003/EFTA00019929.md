Robert,

We wanted to let you know that Ghislaine Maxwell’s attorneys intend to file a new bail application. The application has not yet been filed, and we don’t have a specific briefing schedule or hearing date. We will make sure to keep you updated, but we wanted to touch base in advance to make sure you were aware. As always, please feel free to give us a call if you have any questions or if you’d like to discuss this.

Thank you,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
New York, NY 10007
