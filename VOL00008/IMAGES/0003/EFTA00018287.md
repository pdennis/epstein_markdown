Hi _______ – do you want to look next or should I? I’m pretty flexible this afternoon, so happy to defer to your schedule.

Thanks very much, __________. I think this is in great shape and is very compelling. Some small edits and my responses to your comments attached. Happy to jump on a call if that would be useful.

All,

Attached is the most recent draft of the NPA brief. Apologies for the delay, I really struggled with this one. I think our arguments in the first half are strong, but I’m really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your comments/edits. I’ve also flagged a few issues for consideration/discussion. If you’re able to review tomorrow morning, that would be great.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
