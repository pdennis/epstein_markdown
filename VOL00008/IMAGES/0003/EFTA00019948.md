We were certainly saddened to see the news this morning, as I know all of you were. I appreciate that you have more pressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SDNY's investigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against other defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. Just anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant in a case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I think you brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. So despite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, heads should be held high.

Best,
Jenna
