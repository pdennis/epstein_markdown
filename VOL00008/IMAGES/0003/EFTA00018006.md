Ah, good catch--I don't think so. The only instruction I received is the attached (which is preponderance of the evidence). Could one of you please send me a copy of or steer me in the direction of where to find the reasonable doubt instructions (I don't obviously see it on the shared, sorry if I am missing anything)?
