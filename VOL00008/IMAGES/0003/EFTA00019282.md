Thanks so much, Would you please send me the MDC cover letters so I can send them to MDC counsel?

Hi all,

The envelope with the CD containing the Eighth Production materials and the envelope with the CD's password have both been left for FedEx pickup at the Office. I included the cover letter sent to defense counsel on the CD as well. The tracking number for the envelope containing the CD is 816289189888.

Thanks so much, all!
