Thanks for your email. In accordance with Judge Nathan's order, we are writing to confer regarding Exhibit 11 and your cover letter dated March 9, 2021. Attached please find proposed redactions to Exhibit 11. We do not believe any redactions are necessary to your cover letter.

We intend to file the brief with the redactions as set forth in Judge Nathan's March 18, 2021 order, attached here for your convenience. We note that the redactions contained on pages 118 to 119 redact quotations from and references to a document that you filed under seal (Exhibit H). We understand that the quoted portions of that document are also under seal on the civil docket before Judge Preska. Given those facts, we wanted to double check with you to see whether you in fact want those redactions removed. We will defer to you on whether these should be redacted.

Best,
