Subject: DVR Update

Just got an update from OTD, Digital Forensic Analysis Unit (DFAU),
DVR 1 has been up and running since the last update. DFAU received the password from the MCC Contractor earlier this morning. They are reviewing the data now. (NFI)
DVR 2 (the cameras that covered the MCC SHU) is currently not running. The MCC Contractor has been approved to enter the OTD Lab and start working with DFAU tomorrow to get DVR 2 running. More to follow...
