Subject: Press Coverage re Op Stolen Globe/Epstein

I have suspicions about who tipped off the press given my recent back and forth with some of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, but in any event, this appeared in this morning’s Palm Beach Post.

[Redacted] Can we set up the meeting with the AUSAs in California and New Mexico some time soon?
