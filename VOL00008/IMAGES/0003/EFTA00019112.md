FYI, I am merely forwarding this email sent to me but directed to you. It isn't from a journalist, so far as I can tell, but rather from an Epstein/Andrew/others conspiracy theorist. The gentleman is asking you to make a public statement about Andrew and the investigation that addresses two points:

- "The first would be to make an unequivocal statement to the press that the Prince IS now a target of your investigation due to his obfuscation and blatant stonewalling."
- "...this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand?"

FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN

Dear [REDACTED]

May I offer my congratulations on the way in which your office has been handling the Prince Andrew Affair this past week?

My thinking is that it must have been rather interesting, even for a grown man, to learn just how low and dirty and tricky the British can sink when push comes to shove? They make Roger Stone, he who still has a Richard Nixon tattoo on his back, look like an amateur don't they?

Everyone it the UK has hugely welcomed the news that an MLA has been sought with the Home Office, and most seem to be confident that Priti Patel dare not interfere by denying your request. The consensus seems to be that she would instantly destroy not only her career but also her life by acting to prevent someone who is obviously a child-abuser and paedophile from facing justice when the entire English-speaking world has branded him a liar after the car-crash interview.

However I am not so certain. Looking at the tactics they have employed this past week, of trying to blame you for all of Prince Andrew's ills when you are in the middle of trying to conduct a professional investigation into

something as serious as child sex slavery; my thinking is that they are willing to use every dirty trick in the book to keep the pervert Prince out of the FBI's clutches. The UK Tory Party has always been an instrument designed primarily to maintain the status quo in this country, with priority always given to perpetuation of the monarchy.

It would not be beyond the Eton/Westminster old boys to find some way of using Priti Patel without her even being aware of it. (she's not all that bright) Mark my words, this is what I expect will happen next; and I am a man who told the world that Jeffrey Epstein would never make it to trial barely 48 hours before his life was ended.

So there are two things I am now hopeful you might do. The first would be to make an unequivocal statement to the press that the Prince IS now a target of your investigation due to his obfuscation and blatant stonewalling.

Many are they on your side of the pond who have said, quite rightly, that an innocent man does not deflect or hide.

And it is for this reason that everyone in Britain now feels that Prince Andrew really should be extradited. The reaction to the latest headline from the Sun newspaper has made this abundantly clear. Everyone is saying that if he were a Plumber or a Bus Driver he would be in handcuffs on a flight bound for New York right now. So don't you think it is high time, and this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand? Is it not a slap in the face of Democracy to accord Prince Andrew special privileges simply because of his royal status?

What does General William Barr want the world to think? That perhaps there may be people in high places in America who are guilty along with Prince Andrew? And this after Donald Trump himself was filmed next to their close mutual friend Jeffrey Epstein yelling "oh yeah, she looks hot!".

Journalists all over the globe have been saying the whole world has been watching this affair unfold as if they had telescopic eyeballs. If the United States law system does not interrogate this wicked man under oath very soon the world will have to conclude that the American ruling class is controlled by Paedophiles in exactly the same way as the British ruling class. And that the kind of corruption we have seen in Hollywood which led to the death of children like Heather O'Rourke is endemic throughout the higher echelons of the entire Anglo/American establishment.

Is this what you want the world to think? Does your Attorney General want the world to think that he must be a child abuser as well?

You are now aware that the British Royal family are nothing but gangsters, every bit as willing as were the Chicago mob of the 1930's to silence anyone who becomes inconvenient. So please think about this very carefully...

Supposing during the course of your investigation you uncover the inconvenient truth that both Donald Trump and your Attorney General ARE involved with the international paedophile network? and that your own country truly is being run by gangsters?

What then?

kind regards
