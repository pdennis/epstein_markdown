Safe Horizon has two people that WILL GIVE SUPPORT AND COUNSELING TO Epstein Victims.

Victoria Dexter (VP, Mental Health Treatment) and Sherri Papamihalis (Clinical Director – Counseling Center.) Our Counseling Center has available slots, so perhaps you guys can all connect and see if that would be the right fit for the victims in the Epstein case. Thanks! Sherri phone number is 718 9286914

I hope this helps. I know she is in Florida but thought if anyone else asks you this is a great resource.
