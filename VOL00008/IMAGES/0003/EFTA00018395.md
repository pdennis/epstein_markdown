Hi ______ and ______

I'd be interested in working with an intern this fall. Full disclosure, I think my workload in the fall will be mostly Epstein-related, and I don't have any trials or hearings scheduled, so I'm not sure it would be a very diverse experience.

Subject: NYU Law Interns -- Fall Semester

Please let us know if you would be interested in working with an NYU Law School intern in the Fall semester (September 3-December 3). Please also let us know if you (1) have any trials or hearings scheduled during that time, or (2) asked for, but didn't get, an intern last Spring.

Thanks,
