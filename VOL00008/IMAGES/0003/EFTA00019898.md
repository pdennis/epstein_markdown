Subject: Copy of production from PAE
Date: Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:41:38 +0000

Hi [REDACTED],

Following up on our phone call just now, I’m writing to confirm that PAE will make a new copy of the 1.2 million document production that they already copied onto the 2 defense drives last week. I understand that you will coordinate to get PAE a drive on which to load this copy. Would you please ask PAE to send the drive to [REDACTED] again?

Thanks very much,
