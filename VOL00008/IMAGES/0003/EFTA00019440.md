Our intern ☐ reviewed these and confirmed that there are no records from the 1990s (all were from 2004 or 2005).
☐ and ☐ were not mentioned, though the attached mentioned a ☐ with no last name provided. Let me know if you need anything further on this project.

Hi ☐

Are you able to ask another paralegal to review the flight records in these folders and let us know if there are any records from the 1990s? Or if any of the records name ☐ or ☐?

Thanks!
