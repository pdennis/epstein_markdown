Good with me. I believe we are using FBI line but you should confirm that with [REDACTED].

Also in [REDACTED] quote: Are we trying to say no matter where the incident took place?

FBI Assistant Director [REDACTED] said: “We are asking anyone who may have been victimized by Jeffery Epstein, or anyone who may have information about his alleged criminal behavior, to please call us. The number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. We want to hear from you, regardless of the age you are now,

or whatever age you were then, no matter the incident that took place. The bravery it takes to call us might empower others to speak out about the crimes committed against them. It is important to remember there was never, nor will there ever be an excuse for this type of behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victims will always come first."
