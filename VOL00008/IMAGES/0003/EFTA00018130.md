In most cases, we had the agents interview the inmates without counsel after doing a Hammad memo. I've attached a few examples. Where the inmate is a cooperator, we worked through the attorney. There were also two instances where an inmate was not a cooperator but we worked through the attorney because of the nature of the defendant (both were EDNY death eligible inmates).

I'm working on a Rikers investigation, and suggested I check with you to ask: for the MCC case, were you ever present for an uncounseled inmate interview, or did you guys just have agents do those interviews? He wasn't sure what the practice was. Thanks.
