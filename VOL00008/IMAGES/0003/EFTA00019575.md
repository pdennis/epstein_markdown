I received the e-mail. I will run it by an associate for a second opinion. If I then have questions I will circle back.

Otherwise I will let you know about the timing of the attorney proffer regarding the issues you have outlined.

Subject: RE: SDNY investigation,

Jeff,

Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have reason to believe Ms. [mailto:] has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with that view. In your further discussions with Ms. [mailto:] in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely.

Please let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming weeks about productive next steps.

thank you,
