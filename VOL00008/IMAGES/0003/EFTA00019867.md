Hi John,

We’ve had multiple helpful prep sessions with [redacted] this summer, and we are planning to call him as a witness at trial. Attached please find a subpoena requiring his testimony at the trial scheduled to begin on November 29, 2021.

Our team will let you and [redacted] know closer to trial what date he will be needed to testify. I expect he will testify sometime in the second or third week of trial in December. We will reach out in early November 2021 to schedule additional prep by VTC and to make travel and hotel arrangements for [redacted]. In the meantime, if you or [redacted] have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our team.

Thanks,
