Hi team,

Attached are the script and PowerPoint for Monday's grand jury presentation. If you have the time/interest, I'd welcome any thoughts/suggestions. Also, hopefully this goes without saying, but if any of you would like to join for the presentation, you are of course welcome, but no pressure!

Thanks,
