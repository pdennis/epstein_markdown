Priority cameras from dvr1 completed downloading. The contractor is here working on the replacement system and reports that he could get the new system up and recording tonight. The cart and mxu team will be departing. The A7 Agent and the BOP employee will stay with the DVR until the tech is done and the cameras are up and recording. Once that is done A7 agent will secure the room with evidence tape until c19 team arrives tomorrow. I will stage downloaded video on opwan for mxu to copy tonight to transcode and stage on ttk for review. The DVR can be shut down and collected tomorrow. I will come back with who ever comes here to do that.
