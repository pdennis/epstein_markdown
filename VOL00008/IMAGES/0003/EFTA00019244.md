Thanks, team. Let's set up a conference call at 1pm on Wednesday to discuss. Does that time work for everyone?

All,

Attached please find the prosecution memo for the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation. The team will be working on a draft indictment, but we wanted to submit the memo as soon as it was completed.

Thanks,
