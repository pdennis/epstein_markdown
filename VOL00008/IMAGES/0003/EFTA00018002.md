Hey [redacted]

Attached are the travel records as requested. However, it's the same issue as last time..since the outbound departures were not recorded during that timeframe it only shows the inbound arrivals. Any questions or concerns don't hesitate to reach out.

Hi [REDACTED]

I hope you are doing well. We were hoping you could pull some additional CBP records for us. Are you able to assist us with that this week?

Thanks so much,
