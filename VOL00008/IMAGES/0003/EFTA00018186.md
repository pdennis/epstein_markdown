Thanks,  I'll loop back in in a couple of months and let you know where things stand.

Thanks again, and have a nice weekend.

Good morning,

Sorry for my late response. I have been out of the office all week. I can testify if need be. Let me know if you need anything further.

Thank you,

Thanks,  We'd like to identify a records custodian who could testify, in the event that it would be necessary.

We found the attached cover letter and certification from FedEx in 2008, in case they are helpful in finding the specific production on your end.

Thanks,

Hi

We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if need be. The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November.

I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too.

Thanks,

Good morning,

EFTA00018187

I have reviewed the records and they seem to be our records. Are you needing someone to sign an affidavit or appear in person at trial? (is this "the" Jeffrey Epstein?)

Thank you,

Hi

I hope you had a nice weekend, and thanks again for the call last week. I've attached the FedEx records for which we are looking for a records custodian. According to a log, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sent FedEx a subpoena in February 2008, and the FedEx point of contact was [redacted]. If we find any front matter, like an internal tracking number, we'll let you know.

Thanks again for your assistance with this. Please let me know if you have any questions.
