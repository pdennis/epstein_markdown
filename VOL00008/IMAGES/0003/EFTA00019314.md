All,

Thanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we have discussed. We want to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this along since you’ve asked us to send you a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final from our perspective, and this may change following our conversations with victims during the conferral process.

We recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not want to delay notifying the victims, and, as we’ve discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims notifying them that we are in plea negotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your client in the next few days, so let’s plan to talk mid-week.

Thanks,

Between approximately 2001 and 2013, [redacted] worked for Jeffrey Epstein as a personal assistant. [redacted] has been evaluated by an expert psychologist who specializes in victims of sexual trauma, who completed a report dated April 21, 2020 regarding [redacted] experiences before, during, and after her employment with Epstein. The parties agree that the contents of the expert’s report may be considered at sentencing, and the Government does not dispute that [redacted] was herself a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein, as discussed in the expert report.

During the period of her employment between approximately 2002 and 2005, as part of her duties to schedule appointments at the direction of Epstein and Maxwell, [redacted] scheduled hundreds of appointments for women and girls, including dozens of minors, to massage Epstein. Over the course of that several year period, Epstein received approximately two to three massages per day, and during those massage appointments, Epstein sexually abused dozens of minor victims. The vast majority of the massage appointments that [redacted] scheduled took place at Epstein’s residence in Palm Beach, Florida, though some victims recall that [redacted] arranged massages which took place at Epstein’s residence in New York, New York. [redacted] has reported that she has no recollection of scheduling massages for anyone in New York. [redacted] did occasionally schedule massages to take place in Florida by phone while she was in New York City. When [redacted] was first hired, she used a directory provided to her by Epstein’s previous personal assistant and Ghislaine Maxwell to contact women and girls to massage Epstein. Over the ensuing years, [redacted] would add new names to the directory when directed to do so by Epstein or Maxwell.

EFTA00019317

Through the process of arranging and facilitating massage appointments for Epstein, [REDACTED] met dozens of underage victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. For example, when minor victims arrived for the appointments at Palm Beach, [REDACTED] sometimes met them, walked them up to the massage room, and set up the massage table for the appointment. After some of the appointments, [REDACTED] paid minor victims in cash. Epstein encouraged minor victims to bring other girls to massage him, which led to an increasing number of victims coming to massage Epstein at his residences.

None of those victims told [REDACTED] that they were underage. [REDACTED] did know that some of those victims did not have their own cars, and [REDACTED] arranged for a driver to pick them up and take them to their appointments with Epstein. Additionally, some of those victims told [REDACTED] they could not attend certain appointment times because they were attending school. Epstein also told [REDACTED] that at least one of those victims was studying for the SATs.

During some of the massage appointments with minor girls that [REDACTED] scheduled, Epstein sexually abused the minor girls by, among other things, [REDACTED].

In addition, the Government would be prepared to prove that [REDACTED] witnessed some of the sexual abuse that occurred. In particular, one victim (“Victim-1”) has informed law enforcement that [REDACTED] was present for and participated in one massage when Victim-1 was a minor, during which Epstein touched Victim-1’s [REDACTED]. Another victim (“Victim-2”) has informed law enforcement that [REDACTED] walked in on one instance in which Victim-2, a minor, was [REDACTED]. Epstein. Another victim (“Victim-3”) has informed law enforcement that [REDACTED] walked in when Victim-3 was a minor and was [REDACTED] in Epstein’s massage room. [REDACTED] has informed the U.S. Attorney’s Office that she denies participating in any of the incidents described by Victim-1, Victim-2, and Victim-3.

In or about 2005, [REDACTED] learned that law enforcement was investigating Epstein for sex crimes involving minors, arising from the massage appointments, some of which [REDACTED] had scheduled. After learning about the investigation into Epstein, at Epstein’s direction, [REDACTED] called multiple minor victims and encouraged them to “help” Epstein and conveyed that Epstein would help them if they helped him. [REDACTED] encouraged them to talk to Epstein’s investigator, offered that Epstein would pay for an attorney for them, and, in one or two cases, [REDACTED] offered financial incentives to victims. [REDACTED] understood that by asking her to make these calls, Epstein intended to dissuade the victims from speaking to law enforcement, and by agreeing to make the calls and take these steps, she was aiding him in this objective. Beginning in approximately 2006, multiple minor victims were interviewed by federal law enforcement officers who were conducting a criminal investigation of Epstein and his associates for sex trafficking of minors, among other federal offenses. During those interviews, minor victims reported to federal agents that Epstein paid them for sexualized massages while they were underage girls, including during massages that [REDACTED] scheduled.
