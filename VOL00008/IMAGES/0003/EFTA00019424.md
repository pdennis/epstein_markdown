Has Judge Nathan scheduled a day to rule on Maxwell's renewed bail motion? If/when, should we update the VW site?

&gt;&gt; We filed our response today, but Judge Nathan required us to file it under seal with proposed redactions in the first instance. Defense counsel has 24 hours to object to our redactions. So our response likely won’t be on the docket for at least a couple days.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pardon the interruption, I couldn’t seem to find it on PACER, but when is our response to their renewed bail package due? Thanks.
