I’m happy to pick it up if you want to leave it on your chair, I know you’re busy.

Subject: proffer agreement

Hi [redacted]

So sorry to bug you while you’re on trial. We are flying to Florida on Tuesday morning for a proffer with [redacted], and I think you have the original proffer agreement in your files for the Epstein investigation. Any chance we could please grab that from you by tomorrow?

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
