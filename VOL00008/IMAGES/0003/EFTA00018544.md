## II. Charged Cases

U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): This summer, we charged Ghislaine Maxwell with conspiring to entice minors to travel for the purpose of sexual abuse in connection with helping Jeffrey Epstein to abuse his many victims. The case focused on three specific victims that traveled to be abused by Epstein, including instances in which Maxwell herself participated in the acts of abuse. Trial is set for this coming July. We are finishing discovery, and motions are scheduled for December. Motion practice could generate further press; for example, the defendant continues to press for the identity of the specific victims, and if she is successful, that would surely lead to a round of press about the victims and the details of our case. Relatedly, we are in plea negotiations with counsel for [redacted], another Epstein co-conspirator. [redacted] who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count.
