Good morning all,

I have been in contact this morning through [redacted] and am going to see what other information I can get now that I am here at the institution. I am attaching the press release that just went out. I will call [redacted], but then I'll be out of touch inside the institution for a bit. If you need to reach me, contact Control at [redacted].

Thank you,

Supervisory Staff Attorney
CLC New York

As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.

Thank you,

FYI:

The BOP just informed us that Epstein is being taken by ambulance to the hospital from another apparent suicide attempt- no other information was provided.

They will update us as more info becomes available.
