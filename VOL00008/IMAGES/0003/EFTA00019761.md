Hi

Thanks, that probably makes sense. Are you guys back in the city? Let's all check in at some point to talk about next steps. Thanks.

Would you want to cut a Subpoena to this company for his flight records?

Hey guys,

just wanted me to reach out to you guys, I interviewed the air traffic control guy Pat, and through a couple phone calls, we believe that St. Thomas Jet Center (340-777-9177, Pat Hatch, employee) dealt with Epstein's helicopter. I called over there to confirm and they said the company has no comment and will not confirm anything regarding Epstein. Just wanted you guys to know in the event a subpoena was needed.
