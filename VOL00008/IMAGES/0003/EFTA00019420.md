Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case.¹ This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. An index of the materials contained in this production is below:

¹ Files in PDF format designated as "confidential" under the protective order have been stamped "confidential." However, certain files cannot be individually labeled as confidential on the documents themselves due to their file format.
