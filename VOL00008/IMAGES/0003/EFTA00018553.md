FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc.

https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-eosteins-nm-grazing-leases.html

The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article:

The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased by

Epstein “because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given us the perfect reason.”

...

Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was “taking back lands that should be managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children.” Public schools are one beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: “We continue to investigate this matter at the state level in coordination with U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.”

Thank you for the speedy response. Next week works for us. Can you all do the call next Thursday, September 12th at 1:30 MT / 3:30 ET?

Hope you’re doing well. This week is a bit tough for us. Are there dates next week that would work for you? We are traveling Monday through Wednesday, but could talk Thursday or Friday.

Thanks,

I was looking for a follow up call and I were hoping to schedule a follow up call with you concerning Epstein's New Mexico conduct and property sometime this week. We are both available tomorrow morning (9-12 MT / 11-2 ET) or Friday any time after 12pm MT / 2pm ET. Do you all have availability for a follow up call on either of these days?

Thanks,

We certainly can be in touch. I'm copying my colleagues on the case, [Redacted], because I have a trial starting August 26 so I'll be mostly unavailable next week, but it should be possible to find a time for one or both of them to chat. If you send a couple possible times for next week we can figure it out.

Thanks,

Would you have a couple of minutes to chat with me and one of my colleagues about some NM-related Epstein matters this afternoon or early next week? If today works for you, I am available any time after 1:30 MT / 3:30 ET today. It is nothing urgent.

Thanks,
