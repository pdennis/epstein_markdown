Thanks so much. I was actually able to scan my version of signature the other day. Attached is a subpoena from another case with that signature included. Would you please insert it into all of these subpoenas for the Korea case?

Couple other corrections:

- All of the riders appear to have a typo in the sentence beginning "A list of accounts hold, controlled, or accessible to the following individual(s) and/or entity(ies)," which should instead read "A list of accounts held, controlled, or accessible to". Would you please fix that before sending out?
- There are a couple instances in which the word "Alaska" is misspelled (it's written "Alaska" in the riders). Would you please correct those?
- Some of the riders have highlighting in them—would you please remove that?

With those changes, these are good to go out.

Thanks,

Hey

I just took over paralegal duties from [redacted] for this case. There were a number of riders that [redacted] sent me and which I have turned into drafts of subpoenas. All of them are attached and in the drafts folder on the shared.
