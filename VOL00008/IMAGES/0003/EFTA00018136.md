We've only received the additional material today; it is voluminous which means we won't be in a position for any meaningful conversation tomorrow. I suspect not before Friday either. Can we pencil in 3-4 pm on Friday and will confirm on Thursday?

Mark – Hope you had a good weekend and just wanted to circle back on this. Realizing it is starting to get a bit late in the day in London, would tomorrow morning (New York time) work for a follow up call on this? Perhaps around 10am our time/3pm in London? If so, we can circulate another dial in.

Thanks,

Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is handling ongoing work into Mr E's world?
