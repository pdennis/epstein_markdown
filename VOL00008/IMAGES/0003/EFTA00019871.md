Thank you so much for meeting with us by video-conference today. As discussed, attached please find a trial subpoena for the case in SDNY. We will reach back out in early November 2021 to prep via video. At that point, we will be able to give you a better estimate of when you will likely be called to testify, and we can make arrangements for your travel and hotel for trial.

In the meantime, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if any issues come up.

Best,
