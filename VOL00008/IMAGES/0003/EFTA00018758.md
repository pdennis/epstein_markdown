Hi ,

Can we push our start to 10:15? I have a 9am Zoom hearing and want to give myself enough time to walk over to your office. Otherwise, we are free all day.

EFTA00018758

We can start as early as you want on Friday (earlier than 9am is Ok).

I’ll make sure [REDACTED] and I fill out the form and bring it with us.

Hi Joe,

Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check in on scheduling for our meetings on Thursday and Friday. Let’s still plan to meet at 10 a.m. on Thursday, if that works for you. On Friday, could we possibly move our meeting up to 9 a.m.?

With respect to pandemic protocols, our mask requirement remains in place. However, the process for entry is different. I’m attaching the self-screening form the department uses. No need to send me anything—the folks at security will review it with you and your client when you arrive, but that’s it.

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented [redacted] prior to his passing in 2018. Agent [redacted] served [redacted] with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan’s former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

Joe
