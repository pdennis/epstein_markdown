Hi

In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks!

- Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day
- We do not need a conference room
- Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m.
- Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m.
- If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great – it’s possible we’ll need to rebook parts of this if witness availability changes or we’re able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness.

Thanks a bunch.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview (or possibly interviews) in Los Angeles on December 16 and/or 17. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 15th to the 18th. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those days.

thank you,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, [redacted], and/or [redacted], as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows).

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either be me and [redacted] or [redacted] and [redacted], but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

thanks very much,
