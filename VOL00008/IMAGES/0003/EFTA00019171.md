Subject: Contact from Press regarding Jeffrey Epstein

Hi [REDACTED] – I received a telephone message from [REDACTED]. She has contacted us in the past and is currently making several calls to the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein. In her calls to the FBI, she claims that she is doing a documentary and writing a book regarding human trafficking and about Epstein’s use of a modeling agency to assist him in trafficking underage girls into the United States to use in sexual conduct.

A few years ago, FBI tried to get documentation from her “source” regarding these allegations, but the “source” didn’t appear for interviews and never provided documentation. Sarnoff recently began calling FBI Miami to again make these allegations. It is my understanding that FBI has told Sarnoff that if her “source” wants to come forward with evidence and be interviewed, FBI is more than willing to listen, but Sarnoff is dissatisfied with that response.

Obviously I haven’t called [REDACTED] back, but I assume that she is calling us for the same reason. If so, can you direct her to [REDACTED] at the FBI?

Thank you!
