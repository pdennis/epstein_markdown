Good morning,
Sorry for the late response. Our IT team was not able to go back past 2007. I am attaching a spreadsheet with the shipments on his account from 2007 – 2020 for your review. Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.

Thank you,

Hi,
Thank for your help with this inquiry. We're not sure whether this would have been the same account number during the time period we're looking at, but the account number we have is . More broadly, we are searching for any accounts or data associated with Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.

Thank you,

Do you have a FedEx Express account number? I am going to reach out to IT and see what they can find or have.

Thank you,
