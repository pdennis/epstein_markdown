Chiefs,

Thanks very much for talking this morning. As discussed, attached is a draft application for an amended search warrant correcting the FBI barcode numbers for 3 devices that were seized from Epstein’s NY residence. In case it’s useful, I’m also attaching the exhibits that are referenced in the draft application.

Thanks,
