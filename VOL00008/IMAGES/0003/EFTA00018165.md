Subject: House Oversight issue

- good morning. Hope that you are well. I received a call from the House Oversight Committee yesterday related to the Jeffrey Epstein indictment. Would you be the right point of contact to discuss their request? If not, could you put me in touch with the team handling this matter?

Thanks,
