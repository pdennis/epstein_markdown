Hi, [redacted] Our Jeffrey Epstein team here is working on gathering material that may be discoverable in our case or pertinent to an anticipated motion by Epstein for dismissal based on the S.D.Fla. agreement. We assume you had to pull together a lot of discovery for the CVRA litigation, and that you probably have a good sense of where else, or with whom else, in the S.D.Fla., we might need to look for pertinent information. The attorneys in the N.D.Ga. who are handling the CVRA litigation said we should check directly with you, and ADAG [redacted] cleared us to reach out to you directly on this. Would you have some time this week for us to give you a call about this? Thanks much,

- [redacted]
