Subject: Epstein estate subpoena
Date: Mon, 21 Dec 2020 16:16:40 +0000

Hey

Do you happen to recall where things stood with the Epstein estate regarding the subpoena for images and videos when you transitioned off the case? We want to check back in with the estate attorneys, but want to check where we left things before reaching out. In trying to figure out where things stand, I was looking through our past subpoenas, but couldn't find the subpoena to the estate covering images/videos. Do you know where I can find that?

Thanks,
