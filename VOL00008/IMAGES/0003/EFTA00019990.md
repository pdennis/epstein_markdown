Hi ,

Just a heads-up that Judge Berman invited the Warden and I to the hearing this morning. The Warden declined because of another meeting and asked to meet the Judge at a later date, but I'll be attending. I asked if Judge Berman's expectation was for me to sit at counsel's table or in the galley, but she never responded. In that case, I defer to you unless we hear otherwise when we get there.

Thanks,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi and .

Is the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's injuries still ongoing? I ask because we have a conference before Judge Berman tomorrow morning, and we expect that he will ask us about what happened at the MCC. If the investigation is still ongoing, we will tell him that. If it has been completed, would you please send us any new reports and whatever documentation sets forth the conclusions that the investigators reached?

Thanks,
