[REDACTED] and [REDACTED].

Could you please send us scans of all the interview notes since Epstein’s arrest? If there are any 302s ready, that would be great, but in the first instance notes would be helpful.

We are working on memos briefing our supervisors on a series of issues, and it would be helpful to reference notes.

Thanks,

[REDACTED]
