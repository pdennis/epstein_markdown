Hey

I'm not sure why we got sent these in this format, but could we ask you to please separate these docs out and save them in the relevant folders? They can go in folders here:

Please save each interview notes with the format: YYYY-MM-DD, [First name Last name], interview notes

For anyone we already have folders for, the notes can be added to the existing ones; for anybody who we don't yet have folders, please create new subfolders in that overall one.

And of course please let us know if any questions, issues, etc – and thank you!
