Thanks very much. See attached. As to the second attachment (the blackbook), we only showed her page 19 of the attached PDF. When you send this 302, please be sure to include whatever attachments you include to the 302. Thanks again!

No problem. I'm not in the office today but will be back tomorrow and I can send all of my notes along. Can you please send me the documents we discussed that we're shown during the interview that was just me and you present for? Once I have those I can finalize the 302 and send that to you tomorrow as well once it gets approved.
