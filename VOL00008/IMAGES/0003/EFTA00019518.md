- welcome to the glorious world of mass-document management! If you could please fill out the attached form and send to cc’d, he’ll get you an RSA token that you’ll need for logging in. Relativity is web-based so we all can access it from anywhere.

thanks,

Good Morning

The following people will need to fill out the attached form as they do not have an RSA token to access Relativity

Please have everyone send the attached form back to me and I will have an RSA token sent to them.

Thank you.

We'd like to set up a Relativity database, please, for U.S. v. Epstein, [redacted] and to grant access to AUSAs [redacted].

Currently the only documents we need to have uploaded are in the following folder:

USvEpstein-2 Investigation\FBI materials (reports, FOIA, etc) 2018-12-04, FBI Case File

We'd like the PDF files in the folder uploaded but NOT the files in the subfolder (titled "Files combined and manifest"). We also expect to be receiving a large amount of case files in the coming weeks, and so want to get up and running, including agent access, so there's no delay once we receive the large batch of documents.

With respect to anticipate review process, it's possible that at some point we might receive materials that would necessitate a privilege review, but not at this stage and not with respect to the materials in the linked folder.

Please let me know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks very much.
