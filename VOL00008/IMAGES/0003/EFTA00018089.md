Subject: RE: Epstein priv review -- 1B72 released and update

I'm loading 1B72 to your shared directory now. We did not remove any potentially privileged materials. As stressed below, do not try to open from the shared directory.

Enrique is generating NP reports for 1B69 and 1B84.

W/r/t 1B84, we are removing 169 PP emails, so there will be 1762 emails, and we are removing one PP chat (with Darren Indyke) so there will be 243 chats.

W/r/t 1B69, we are removing 93 PP emails, so there will be 1074 emails.

I'll finish 1B71 tomorrow.

And as always, stop your review and let me know if you come across anything that you think may be privileged.

And thanks for all the help today!!

We just finished 1B83. 30 emails were removed as potentially privileged. The redacted report is saved to your shared directory below but DO NOT open it from the shared or it will shut down the office network. Save it to your D drive or Enrique can put it on a flashdrive.

Great, can you do 1B72 first and if we still don't have a PRIV shared directory, email it to just me? The case team is on a tight discovery deadline so I want to get reviewing asap.

Thanks.

Great! Can you create the following extractions from the Epstein HD? And save them to the Priv shared directory as soon as I can create one? And then I'll have start reviewing them for privilege.
1B71 – Chats and SMS
1B72 – Chats
1B69 – Chats
1B84 – Chats
1B83 – Chats

Hi

or

will correct me if they have a better way but I think the best way to generate the Responsive Report is to deselect (by removing the x in the column on the far left) all the data in the report and then go to the Tags view and select (by putting the x back in the column on the far left) all your tags. You then go up to the top left and choose the Report drop down and then choose Generate a New Report. Be sure to name it something that makes it clear that it is the Responsive report and you can also choose whether to create a UFDR report or a PDF.

I'll give you an update on the other reports shortly.

Thanks

Hi

I've finished the responsiveness review of the four reports that Reggie generated last week. I've tagged all of the responsive items in each report. What should my next step be to generate reports that only include the tagged items? Now that these are done, and I are all just waiting on the release of the remaining portions of 1B72 and 1B69, as well as any content from 1B71, 1B83, and 1B84. As soon as you can release even just some of those reports, we will dive into the responsiveness review.

To give you a sense of timing: In order to give our paralegals enough time to prepare the responsive materials for production in time for our 11/9 deadline, we need to finish the responsiveness review by no later than Thursday 11/5. So the sooner we can get anything over the wall for us to review, the better.

Thanks very much,

Just to be safe, please double check when you open up the reports that they correspond to the notes below, i.e., 1B72 should not have chats and 1B69 should not have chats and should only have 1074 emails. And as always please stop your review and let me know if you come across anything else that you think may be privileged. Thanks!

1B72 – Release without chats

1B67 – Release entire report

1B68 – Release entire report

1B69 – Release without chats and without the 93 PP emails, as tagged on the attached .pas file (so only release 1074 emails)

Hi [redacted]
First, welcome to the unit! I'm sorry we have not met yet, but I'm looking forward to meeting you when we are both in the office one day.

EFTA00018096

I'm hoping you would be able to help us with some logistics for the privilege review of data extracted from several of Jeffrey Epstein's devices. S going to leave a drive on your desk today, which contains data from several of Epstein's phones and ipads. Would you please copy of all of that data onto a second drive?

Once the data is copied, we then need you to please mail one of the drives to (who is cc'd and will reply to this email with her mailing address). Please keep the second drive in your files in the office till then reach out to you if she needs any additional help coordinating the review of that data for privileged materials.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and thanks so much for your help.
