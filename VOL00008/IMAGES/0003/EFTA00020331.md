Subject: FW: Maxwell superseder prosecution memo

Date: Wed, 24 Mar 2021 03:11:46 +0000

Attachments: Maxwell_S2_Indictment_v1.docx

Wanted to get this to the chiefs today to expedite review, but obviously welcome any thoughts or comments from you guys. I based the new language primarily on the language from our past Epstein and Maxwell indictments, so hopefully nothing too controversial.

Hi team, we have asked what the Brass wants to do in terms of review/meeting, and will let you know. In the meantime and mindful of the Monday GJ date, do you mind putting together a draft indictment for us to review? Thanks!

All,

Attached please find a prosecution memorandum requesting authorization to seek a superseding indictment charging Maxwell with additional criminal offenses. For reference, I have also attached the two prior prosecution memos regarding the original indictment in this case. We have tentatively scheduled grand jury time for Monday, March 29th.

Thanks,
