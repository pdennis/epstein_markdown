Re: Continued investigation into possible collaborators of Jeffrey Epstein

Dear Ms.

Thank you for speaking with myself and others from the New Mexico Office of the Attorney General last week. Pursuant to our telephone conversation, this Office is providing the enclosed materials related to the criminal investigation and potential prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators. The enclosed documents include police reports, recorded witness interviews, correspondence amongst New Mexico State agencies, and documents related to Epstein's leasing of New Mexico public lands.

As previously discussed, all conduct described in our investigation occurred prior to 2008, the year New Mexico enacted its human-trafficking statute. See NMSA 1978, Sections 30-52-1 to -2.1. Should you have any questions, require any law-enforcement assistance in New Mexico, or become aware of any criminal charges implicating New Mexico law not barred by New Mexico's statute of limitations, NMSA 1978, Section 30-1-8, I ask that you do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Should further investigation reveal additional survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico, know that this Office intends to work in union with the United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico to ensure that these brave survivors have the opportunity to see that justice is achieved in a court of law. Again, please contact me personally if your investigation reveals survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico not mentioned in the provided investigative materials.

Epstein’s death should not be the end of this criminal inquiry. I thus thank you for continuing to give this serious matter the attention it deserves. This Office will continue to update you in a timely manner should we become aware of any new information that could be assistive to you.

Respectfully,
