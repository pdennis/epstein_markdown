Hello,

The vendor had to break up the production into seven parts. As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1 – 3 and is about to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is currently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and the export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches:

- ☐ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 01
- ☐ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 02
- ☐ SDNY_PROD015 - PART 03

If there are any questions please let me know.

Thank you.
