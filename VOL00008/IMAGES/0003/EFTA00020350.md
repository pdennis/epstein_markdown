Paragraph three in what I sent is superfluous – it’s removed in the attached, but if you’re already reviewing, no problem, just ignore that para.

Team, apologies again for the delay on this (among other things – and you’ll be entertained by this – [REDACTED] *!), but draft is attached. It is as strong as I could think to make it, but very happy to take additional thoughts or suggestions, and I anticipate we’ll likely get some pushback but we can see what they say. Thoughts / comments / edits? Thanks.
