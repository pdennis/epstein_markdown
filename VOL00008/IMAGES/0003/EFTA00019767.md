A staff member must observe all inmates confined in a continuous locked down status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00 a.m. - 12:30 a.m.) followed by another round in the second 30 minutes period of the same hour (example, 12:30 am - 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart be documented.
