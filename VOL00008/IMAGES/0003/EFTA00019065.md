Subject: JPMorgan Kept Jeffrey Epstein as a Client Despite Internal Warnings

Have we gotten anything yet from JPMC? Any indication of why they ended their relationship with him in 2013?

As I'm sure you've seen, NYT has a piece up on the relationship which suggests executives at JPMC overruled compliance efforts to kick him out back in 2008-09 but the article doesn't suggest any financial misconduct or even red flags in his JPMC accounts, just the fact of his prior conviction.
