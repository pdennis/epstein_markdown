Good afternoon _______________

Our Counsel had a further question regarding the subpoena. In the subpoena, it states the Sacramento County Clerk/Recorder is to appear in person to testify, and produce the requested record, at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Is this a requirement, or will presentation of the record to your office suffice?

Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Andrew B. Graham
Deputy Clerk/Recorder
Sacramento County Clerk/Recorder

I just spoke with our Counsel regarding the subpoena. She agrees that, since this is in regards to a federal criminal case, the record should be issued at no fee. We will need an vital record application completed. The application can be completed in our office by one of your representatives. As an alternative, please complete the attached application form and email back to me. After receiving the completed application, we can process the request and mail it immediately to the address of your choosing. The application will need to be signed, but there is not a requirement that the application be notarized.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
