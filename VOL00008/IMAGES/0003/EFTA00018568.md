Got it. I'm going to copy the file locally and try a few things. I will keep you updated on my progress.

I'm still having the issue. The appendix (the last 30 pages or so) is searchable, but the report (the first 370+ pages) isn't. So, for example, if you CTRL+F "Epstein" the first hit I get is on page 384, even though he is repeatedly referred to in the first 370+ pages.

What is the exact issue you were facing? The searches that I am conducting in the document are happening without issue. Copying the file over to the new location may have solved the issue.

Great, thanks. Did I add you to the share? Or only the drive?

It hasn't yet made it through. Yes, I'd be happy to help once I have shared access.

I don't know if my email below came through – the attachment is huge and has been very difficult to send – but if not, and if you're able to help, I'll put it on a share directory you have access to instead. Thanks!

Do you have time today to help with a quick but time sensitive project? The attached report is not searchable for whatever reason (the short appendix at the end is, but the first 380+ page report is not). Do you know/are you able to resave or convert this in some manner that would make it searchable? Thanks
