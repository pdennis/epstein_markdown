Some combined comments and questions in track. I would like to see again at some point, and I think [redacted] will want to see as well. But hopefully this should permit you to get the relevant section to OIA in the morning.

Subject: GM - Draft Third Bail Opposition

Chiefs,

Hope you both had a nice weekend. Attached for your review is a draft of our opposition to the third bail application, also attached for your convenience. As noted in the draft, we are still waiting on feedback from OIA re France so that section is subject to change. We also plan to send the section on citizenship renunciation to OIA to make sure they review for accuracy (as we did with our last opposition). Given the time difference and our filing deadline of Tuesday, we are hoping to send this to them sometime tomorrow morning, but of course, happy to discuss.

Thanks,
