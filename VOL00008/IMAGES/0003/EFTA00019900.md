Dear and

I am surprised that the video was not retained, as I specifically requested its preservation, and had confirmed with me that he had made the preservation request. See below. Thank you.

Hello Aida,

It was great seeing you as well.

I have asked the appropriate staff to preserve the requested video footage. Please be advised MCC staff do not have body cameras.

Thank you,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Aida Leisenring 7/25/2019 11:54 AM &gt;&gt;&gt; Hello

It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving him extra time to review his discovery. We very much appreciate that.

I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved.

We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal preservation request.

Thank you.
