Could you please pull the FinCEN records listed below and circulate to the team? It sounds like they're potentially useful so we'd like to review. Thank you!

We wanted to make sure you all were aware of several records. See below - a list of relevant document IDs that will allow you to pull the records up in FinCEN Query or cross-reference with your files. Please let me know if you have any issues.

Hi.

I had the impression from email that you had particular documents or reports you were looking to send our way ("so you can coordinate with them to make sure they have already seen any SAR information you guys are looking at") -- if so, we would be grateful for you to send whatever it is you think would be useful. Or please let us know if that's not correct (when says "the relevant SAR information" I'm not sure what that's referring to), and if so what it was you were envisioning.

thanks,

We just want to ensure you have the relevant SAR information you need. To that end, I'm copying of our Intelligence Division, with whom you can liaise directly if necessary.

As discussed, I'm cc'ing a couple of the AUSAs on the Epstein team so you can coordinate with them to make sure they have already seen any SAR information you guys are looking at, or pass it over if they haven't.

Guys,  is with FinCEN counsel (formerly the Office's best friend at OIA), and has some information FinCEN has seen and wants to make sure we're aware of.
