I would like to. ☐ would not allow me to share it with the team unless and until you blessed me doing so. I see no reason why they should not be allowed to review it, and, to the contrary, view them as best positioned to review it. Assuming you're okay with that, I will send it to them now and ask for their comments.

Thanks,
☐
