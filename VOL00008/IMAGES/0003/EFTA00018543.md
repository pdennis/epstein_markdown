Good morning, Geoff and greetings from St. Thomas:

We are having some coordination issues here, regarding the SDNY and USVI investigations of the Jeffrey Epstein matter. I realize that you have a huge number of pressing issues to address and was hoping that you could direct me to one of your supervisors, with whom I could discuss this matter.

Thanks so much,
Gretchen
