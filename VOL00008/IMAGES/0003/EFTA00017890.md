Hi

I'm having issues accessing the folder. I've cc'd our eDiscovery expert, , as I'm hoping if I put the two of you in touch you can iron it out.

The files being produced are outlined in the attached correspondence and will be Bates labeled.

Regards,

Hi

Morning, I've created a USAFx folder between us for sharing these materials, linked below:

If you have any trouble accessing your USAF account, please let me know and I can reset your account.

Hi [REDACTED].

I hope all's well. [REDACTED] has left our office, so I'm copying [REDACTED] here, who can help you or a colleague get set up with USAFX.

[REDACTED], [REDACTED] or a colleague has a production for us and needs a USAFX account.

Thanks!
