Importance: Normal

Called [Redacted] 12/19/18 at 09:30, to advise that we had opened an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein because [Redacted] represents multiple victims / plaintiffs, wanted to ask about other individuals who might be useful to speak with in the initial stages of our investigation.

[Redacted] on the call

[Redacted] advised the following:

- primary [Redacted] attorneys on the case are / were [Redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [s]aid [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redact] [redact] [redact] [redact] [redact] [redact] [red] [ [redact] [al] [also may work on it, in response to inquiry]
- also [Redacted] has worked with [Redacted] former DOJ, and [Redacted]
- believes there was significant misconduct in or in connection to New York
- believes there has been possible obstruction / perjury conduct in connection with civil suits
- best place to start is with victim attorneys, worth talking to [Redacted]

We requested that our inquiry remain generally confidential given the sensitivities of the investigation, including the primarily covert nature of the investigation as well as a desire not to raise the hopes of victims at this early investigative stage.

- [Redacted] advised that he intended to honor the request to keep the investigation confidential, within the bounds of collaborating attorneys

We agreed to speak again in the near future to arrange for subsequent discussions.
