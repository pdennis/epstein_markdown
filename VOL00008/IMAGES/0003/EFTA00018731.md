Subject: Epstein/Maxwell briefing

Hey,

Would you mind sending us the briefing you guys did on not identifying the victims early in Epstein/ Maxwell? The Justice Dept in Canada is requesting a “publication ban” which would stop defense counsel from identifying victims in the extradition case and asked us for a letter. Obviously the posture is different but it would be helpful to see what you highlighted.

Thanks!
