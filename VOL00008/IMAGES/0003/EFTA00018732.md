You can send a round-robin to the Civ Div. In addition to Radar, I did an Epstein search in caseview and here are another couple civ div matters that I think you’re familiar with:
NYT v BOP, 2020V00220
Epstein victim Touhy requests, 2019V01791

FYI, FOIA litigation can be brought in the home district of the requester, or in DDC.

Ok thanks, that’s helpful to know. How would we go about determining whether the civil division litigated any cases based on FOIA requests to other components?

Oh, sorry: our FOIA Tracking Database is designed to cover FOIA requests that are directed to our Office; it does not track FOIA requests to, e.g., the FBI, that end up in litigation in the SDNY and that our Civ Div defends.

Thanks, [redacted] could you please check your records and let us know if there are any other cases? From [redacted]s list, it seems like at least one case is missing (there is a civil case involving a FOIA request from Radar Online).

As we just discussed:
Here is what we have in our FOIA tracking database regarding Epstein FOIAs.
And also attached is the letter in PPI about discovery vs FOIA (see p. 8)

Hi [Redacted]

Hope you're doing well. [Redacted] and [Redacted] and I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. [Redacted] suggested that you'd be the best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information:

- A list of all FOIA requests our office has received;
- For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and
- Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is.

That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

Thanks very much,
