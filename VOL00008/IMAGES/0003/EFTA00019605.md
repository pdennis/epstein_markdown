The email exchange below confirms our inability to locate the first volume of [redacted] deposition. However, attached are fairly detailed notes of Paralegal/Investigator [redacted], who attended the deposition and recorded these notes contemporaneously. [redacted] appears to have held nothing back, and the notes certainly paint a picture of the kind of troubled young women who were particularly susceptible to Epstein’s pattern of recruitment, grooming and victimization.

Jack, below is the “Unable to locate” response from Prose Court Reporting. Visual Evidence, the videography service used, also confirmed on Friday that a copy of the video is no longer available. I have attached [redacted] notes from that deposition.

I have searched our records and archives and I am unable to locate Volume I of this deposition from 2009.
