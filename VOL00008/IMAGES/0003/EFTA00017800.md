On this same subject, since I spoke with you this morning, I have also had a call with [redacted] about this, so our agents are now aware of the issue. I think you also asked about the status of the image review: [redacted] said it's underway and they understand it needs to be completed by the deadline.

Thanks very much for your guidance on this – if you have any other questions before you speak with [redacted] or if any additional information would be useful, please let us know.

Thanks,

Subject: Application for Amended SW
Chiefs,

Thanks very much for talking this morning. As discussed, attached is a draft application for an amended search warrant correcting the FBI barcode numbers for 3 devices that were seized from Epstein's NY residence. In case it's useful, I'm also attaching the exhibits that are referenced in the draft application.

Thanks,
