Hi

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for another witness in the Maxwell trial—We currently expect she’ll testify on. We would like to have her fly in on and out on the evening of. You already booked travel for so I defer to you, but think it would make sense to have her at the same hotel. Also, just flagging that there is a chance that we will need to change her travel dates and will know more once trial is underway. Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much for all of your help!
