Our deferred prosecution application has been sent via FedEx to the attention of [redacted]. There are 5 copies in total. I spoke with co-counsel today and he will have something to you next week. I did my best to give him my recommendations on the proper approach. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Please send me an email or give me a call when you receive our materials. Have a great weekend.

Jason
