- Discussed schedule for trial prep, mechanics of trial testimony. USAO will pay for [redacted] to fly up to NY for trial, with her husband and children as support.
- Since last meeting in January 2021, [redacted] received $3.5 million award from the Victim Compensation Fund run by Epstein’s estate. Several hundred thousand dollars of that amount was taken out, and [redacted] ultimately received over $2 million. [redacted] used the money to buy a new home for her family, a car, to pay off fines to get her license back, and to set up an account for her children.
- [redacted] has had trouble sleeping over the past few months because she has dreams about Epstein and is nervous about testifying at trial. [redacted] continues to speak with her counselor every day and is prescribed medications to help with her mental health and addiction.
- [redacted] believes she lied to [redacted] about her age when they were dating. She believes she told [redacted] that she was 17 years old when she was really younger. [NOTE: [redacted] was not feeling physically well during this interview, so no follow up questions were asked about this topic during this meeting. AUSA arranged to meet with [redacted] later in the week when [redacted] will hopefully be feeling better.]
