Hey Brian,

Here's an unsigned version of the subpoena. We understand from the defense that they are going to serve you later tonight, but if you don't get it by tomorrow morning, let us know and we'll raise it with the Court.

Thanks,

Brian,

We don't have specific information about when you'll get the subpoena, but we and the defense were in Court today for voir dire, so that may have delayed things on their end.

Thanks,
