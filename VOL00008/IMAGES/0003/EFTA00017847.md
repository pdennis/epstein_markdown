Good afternoon-

In compliance with the Court’s order, dated August 25th (attached), I hereby notify you of recent third-party interference with the “secure” Webex line used for confidential/privileged communication between Ms. Maxwell and counsel.

At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon's VTC session, Ms. Maxwell observed suspicious activity on the VTC monitor.

She alerted MDC staff, and Case Manager [redacted] witnessed the activity.

This is contrary to the Court’s finding that “according to the Government and MDC Legal [Ms. Maxwell]’s difficulties communicating with counsel have been resolved” and contrary to “MDC’s Legal assurances that [Ms. Maxwell]’s legal communication has not been interfered with...”

Previously, the MDC has disputed such claims concerning interference with VTC communication between Ms. Maxwell and counsel.

Now, an MDC insider bears witness to complaint by Ms. Maxwell and counsel.

Please provide explanation for this interference and evidence of remediation before I report this latest problem to the Court.

Thank you-

Bobbi
