I think putting comments in an email would be easier for OIG to consider

Subject: RE: OCR'd OPR Report

- The team has a couple of small factual comments on the OPR draft report, none material to any of its conclusions. How would you like us to handle these – do you want me to just call ? Draft an email or a letter? They're sufficiently insignificant that I think a phone call would suffice, but let me know if you feel differently.

Thanks,

Thanks for clueing me in that it was not word-searchable—saved me a major embarrassment. I created a OCR'd version, and there are indeed several references to "global." The OCR'd version is 121 megs, so I'll USAFx it to you.
