I'm not sure I understand the question. Does he mean Epstein's prison call(s) while detained?

and

My HQ has the following question on the underlying case, can you please forward this to the prosecutors on the underlying case? Thank you.

- In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein's phone calls related to the underlying case? If so, were they followed?
