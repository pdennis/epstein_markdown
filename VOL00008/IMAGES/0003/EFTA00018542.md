Q: Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at any of Mr. Epstein’s properties?
A: First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage.

Q: I will ask that question if you want, but I was focusing on people other than Mr. Epstein right now.
A: I don’t give massages.

Q: Let’s just tie that down. Is it your testimony that you’ve never given anybody a massage?
A: I have not given anyone a massage.

Q: You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony?
A: That is my testimony.
