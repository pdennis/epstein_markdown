Good morning all. As always, please don’t forget to get me your updates for next week sometime today.
Thanks,
Laura

P.S. I didn’t feel like wishing anyone Happy Pecan Pie Day (although, of course, you should partake if you celebrate), but of course, Monday is Be a Dork Day, so you could get a jump on planning your outfits now.
