She called me also. I will send her an email and tell her we will not be commenting or speaking about this matter. She is persistent, that’s for sure.

Subject: Request for Press Comment re Epstein

Hi [REDACTED] – [REDACTED] has called me again. She told me to read her two internet articles and then asked me to call her to “discuss” them. Her number is [REDACTED].

Here are the articles. I don’t have any comment.

**Confidential background information:** The investigation stemming from the seizure of the evidence from Epstein’s former butler (who is referenced in the articles), is continuing.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything. Thanks.
