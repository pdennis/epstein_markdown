Good afternoon,

Here is a new FOIA request regarding United States v. Jeffrey Epstein. I am attaching a standard exemption document for you. Please try to send it back on or about July 14th, 2020.

The requester entered his request directly into the portal rather than a PDF.:

“Dear records officer, Pursuant to FOIA, I request a copy of the 5 years of banking records of Jeffrey Epstein from "Insitution-1" referenced by SDNY in a Jul 12, 2019 letter to Richard Berman (see Page 11 of supporting document). Please acknowledge receipt of this request. Thank you. Exact Source: Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 11 Filed 07/12/19”

Thank you!
