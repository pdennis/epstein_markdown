The agents on the Epstein case have asked, below, about the status of the taint review of the materials seized from his Manhattan residence, which were made available on September 10 (see attached). I know that you had dealt directly with Epstein's attorneys regarding search terms, etc., so we haven't had visibility on that, but could you please let us know the current status, and when you expect we'll be able to get access to the materials?

thanks very much,

Hey guys,

Our supervisors are requesting a status update on the taint review process on your end. I simple percentage complete is fine, they just want to know before tomorrow they have a meeting with the ADIC about the case.

Thanks
