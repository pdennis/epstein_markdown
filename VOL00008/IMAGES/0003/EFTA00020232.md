**and**

Attached is a draft search warrant affidavit seeking authorization to expand the scope of our search of Epstein's devices. Thank you so much for your help pulling together the information for this. I left [REDACTED] as the affiant because I believe he swore out the most recent warrant, but let me know if I should switch it to Mandy instead.

Our hope is to get this to Judge Gorenstein this afternoon and swear it out tomorrow. Whichever of you will be the affiant, would you please call me with any corrections/edits to the affidavit? You'll see there's one question in there from Ted about whether we've seen any photos of Maxwell on the discs seized from the NY residence that I'm hoping you can help me answer.

Thanks,

[REDACTED]
