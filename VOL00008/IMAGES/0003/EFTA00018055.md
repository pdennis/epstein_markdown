Perfect, I received the invite with the link. Unfortunately (or fortunately sometimes) WebEx has been a part a daily part of my life the past year, so we should be OK. See you all then, let me know if you need anything further from us in the meantime.

We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end.

you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.

thank you,

Assistant U.S. Attorney Southern District of New York

My former partner, Alan Ross, represented prior to his passing in 2018. Agent served with a grand jury subpoena earlier today, and as Alan's former partner and FL Bar appointed inventory attorney, she has contacted me. Unfortunately, I am unable to meet with her until Tuesday, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time at your convenience as I am getting up to speed. Please let me know what day/time is best for you.

Look forward to speaking with you.

Best,

Joe
