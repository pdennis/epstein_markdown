Re: United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK)

Dear Judge Karas:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to update the Court regarding the defense’s request for certain video footage from inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) on July 22 – July 23, 2019 (the “Video”). Earlier today, the Government confirmed with MCC staff that the Video was preserved by MCC staff upon defense counsel’s request in July 2019, and the Government is in the process of obtaining a copy of the Video from the MCC. Once the Government obtains a copy of the Video, the Government intends to make it available for defense counsel’s review at the United States Attorney’s Office.

Respectfully submitted,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
