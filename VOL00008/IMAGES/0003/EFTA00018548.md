Hello

Attached is a letter from Noel’s counsel requesting additional discovery. Take a look at items 1-13. Does the FBI CURRENTLY have any notes, reports, or information of any sort responsive to those items? We are NOT asking you to do any additional investigation. Give me a call to discuss.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
