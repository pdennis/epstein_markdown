Hi, unfortunately we can't provide it to you directly but if you request it from OCME they will be able to provide it to you. Let me know if you need a contact (Florence Hutner, their GC, is the right person - Hutner, Florence (OCME) &lt; &gt;).

Are you guys able to turn over the requested documents yet. I'm still waiting to close this case out.

Hi

We are requesting that information today and will give it to you when we get it.

In the meantime, we had heard that the Marshals may have a form that Epstein may have/may not have signed noting he had suicidal tendencies, and this happened around 8/1. Do you know anything about this?

Give me a call with any questions, thanks.
