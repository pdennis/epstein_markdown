Good morning _______________.

Unfortunately we don't yet have any of those details, in terms of timing or judge, because the case isn't yet unsealed and assigned -- but that will happen today at 9:15 and we can circle back immediately then. And he is coming from MCC so will be there as soon as those folks arrive.

We are requesting detention and I expect there will be a bail argument.

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if that would be useful -- my cell is _______________.

thanks,

When will the agents bring him through usms for processing?

Is there an Agreed bail package? Or is your office requesting Detention?

Thanks.
