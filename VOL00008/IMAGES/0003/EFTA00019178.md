The AUSAs we recommend in each district are:

LA
New Mexico

What about New York, ? Have they been approached? What district?

We've worked with both and and they're very good. As we've discussed, I think they AUSAs will want as much information from as they can get – on all aspects of the case. I'm not sure whether an individual or group approach is best, but I leave that decision to USAFLS. We are happy to facilitate and participate in any phone meetings that are called, but, as I said at our meeting, we can't get involved substantively in the investigation.

Let me know how we can help.

I have suspicions about who tipped off the press given my recent back and forth with some of the plaintiffs' attorneys, but in any event, this appeared in this morning's Palm Beach Post.

☐ – Can we set up the meeting with the AUSAs in California and New Mexico some time soon?
