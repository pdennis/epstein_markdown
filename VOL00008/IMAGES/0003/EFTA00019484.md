Hi team, we have asked [redacted] what the Brass wants to do in terms of review/meeting, and will let you know. In the meantime and mindful of the Monday GJ date, do you mind putting together a draft indictment for us to review? Thanks!

All,

Attached please find a prosecution memorandum requesting authorization to seek a superseding indictment charging Maxwell with additional criminal offenses. For reference, I have also attached the two prior prosecution memos regarding the original indictment in this case. We have tentatively scheduled grand jury time for Monday, March 29th.

Thanks, [redacted]
