I am likely not in Monday (MLK day) -- [REDACTED], are you around at any point today for at least a brief update? Brass is also interested in how things went.

I’m traveling back today, could we set a time for Monday? Once I get in later I’m slammed with stuff that has come up the past few days in other cases.
