Hi

Following up on our meeting yesterday, attached is the updated spreadsheet of all identified victims and noting which ones have been contacted. Would you please review this with the FBI victim specialists to note any additional contact with victims since Epstein's death? And if there are still any victims in this spreadsheet who have not been contacted since Epstein's death, would you please attempt to contact them and make a note of those attempts in the spreadsheet?

Give me a call if you have any questions, and thanks so much for your help with this.
