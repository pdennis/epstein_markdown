I logged into Relativity and this looks right to me. Are you guys free at 4 to discuss reviewing batches to make sure everyone is on the same page? Thanks.

Good Morning,

The tags have been created in the database under issue designation field. The batches have been created and you can check out the batches as you see fit. Please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you.
