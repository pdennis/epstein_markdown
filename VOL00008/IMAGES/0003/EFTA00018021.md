Our client has requested that we cancel tomorrow's meeting. She has now had to recount her interactions with Epstein one too many times, and since it's her understanding that it's unlikely that any of her information would in fact materially advance your current prosecutions, she'd prefer to forego another interview.

Hope that's ok on your end, and of course let us know if you have any questions at all.
