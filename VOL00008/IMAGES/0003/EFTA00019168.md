All,

Just wanted to let you know I know got a call on my personal cell from a writer with The New Yorker Magazine on the Epstein case. She has interviewed [REDACTED].

The reporter asked me to verify that I was an agent and that Jason and myself traveled to Australia and interviewed [REDACTED] and that she disclosed that she had sex with Epstein and Allan/Allen Dershowitz. I told her I was an agent and all inquiries about the case would have to through [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I gave her both your email addresses. She said she had emailed [REDACTED] previously.

Have a feeling these calls may become more frequent.

[REDACTED], can't get [REDACTED] email to pop up. Don't know if you want to forward so she's in the loop.

Thanks,
