Thanks, I'll email her right now, just because we need to set up another meeting, too.

And yes, there is plenty to read on . Attached is the team's latest memo along with the latest submission.

Yes, all of them work for me. Happy to email back assuming they work for you.

Is there a pros memo or memo that I could use to get up to speed?
