Hi

Good to see you the other day. As I mentioned, our team is planning to call [redacted] as a witness at the trial scheduled to begin on November 29, 2021. For your records, attached please find a trial subpoena. We expect [redacted] will testify relatively early in the trial, and may even get on the stand on [redacted].

In terms of trial preparation, I'd like to schedule an initial meeting over WebEx, at which point we can pick a time in August for [redacted] to meet with our team in person for further prep at our office. For the WebEx, would you and [redacted] be available the morning of 7/26, the afternoon of 7/27, or the morning of 7/30?

Thanks,

[redacted]
