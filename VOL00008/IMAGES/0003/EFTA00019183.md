No worries. I just dialed in. I don’t think anyone is on the line yet. Let me know if you are and I just am not using this properly.

I have asked my PIO to find out if there is a deadline on this reporting that will necessitate moving up the timing of this call. I will let you know if that turns out to be the case.

Below are the details for the conference call in number and participant code:

Thanks for the advanced notice, we should definitely discuss, particularly since there are rules about press contacts in our pending case that we're mindful of. 2:15 p.m. works for us. On timing, do you have a sense of when you anticipate this happening?

As an FYI, I am really calling to get the contact information for your PIO since there will be reporting in our local news and my USA wants to make a statement, but we want to run this by you all and your PIO first. As for time, does 2:15pm ET work for you all? If so, I can get a conference line set up for that time.

Since our whole team will join to keep everyone looped in, it would be helpful to schedule a call at a particular time, if possible. Could we pick a time on Friday afternoon and use a conference line?

Greetings from DNM,

Well done on the new indictment against Ms. Maxwell. We were pleased to see that conduct in New Mexico formed the basis of one of your overt acts. I know that you all are very busy, but if you a moment for a brief call to discuss the impact, if any, of the new indictment on seizure/forfeiture of Epstein's NM property, I would appreciate it. As you are aware, this is an issue my US Attorney, John Anderson, has asked me to track.

Thanks,

When we last spoke, you expressed a willingness to review New Mexico-specific questions that we would like to be included in future interviews of Epstein victims. While I am certain that you already cover the pertinent questions, we did not want to turn down the invitation to submit a set of proposed questions, which I have attached.

I hope all is well with you and the ongoing investigation. As we mentioned on the phone, we are here to assist with any investigation into New Mexico-related matters, including the submission of any application for a search warrant.

Yes, a call on 9/12 at 1:30 MT / 3:30 ET will work for us, thanks very much.

As a preview in response to [redacted] email, we spoke with the New Mexico AG's office back in July 2019. In essence, they agreed to cease any investigation into sex trafficking and share whatever they had gathered to date regarding sex trafficking activity with our office. We agreed that they were free to proceed with whatever other investigations (unrelated to sex trafficking) they may have concerning Epstein and told them that at the conclusion of our case, we would pass along any information we may have gathered about state crimes that were committed in their jurisdiction. We have not communicated with anyone from the New Mexico AG's office since that conversation in July 2019.

FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc.

https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-epsteins-nm-grazing-leases.html

The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article:

EFTA00019190

The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased by Epstein "because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given us the perfect reason."

Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was "taking back lands that should be managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children." Public schools are one beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: "We continue to investigate this matter at the state level in coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."

We certainly can be in touch. I’m copying my colleagues on the case, Alison and Maurene, because I have a trial starting August 26 so I’ll be mostly unavailable next week, but it should be possible to find a time for one or both of them to chat. If you send a couple possible times for next week we can figure it out.
