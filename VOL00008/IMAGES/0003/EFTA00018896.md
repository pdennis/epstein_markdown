Hi team,

In the interest of expediency, here is the Daubert motion for your comments. I still need to write my section, and I'm doing some significant revisions to the Loftus section, but the Dietz section is done - [redacted] crushed it. That's the bulk of the motion, so feel free to read that over, and I'll send you the rest in a second round later.

Thanks,
