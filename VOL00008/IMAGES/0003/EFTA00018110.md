&gt; "I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student, I am a student."

, Can I ask whether this is still an active matter? if so, I wonder if we could speak when it is convenient.

## Cheers

Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is handling ongoing work into Mr E's world?

Cheers
