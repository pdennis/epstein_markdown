Hi,

We are filing a submission today, but it's not due by 5:00 -- but our hope is to file not long after that, and we'll certainly send you the docketed version as soon as it's up.

thanks,

I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is

EFTA00017830

getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)
