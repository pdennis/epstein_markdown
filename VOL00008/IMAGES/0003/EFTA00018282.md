Hi

Hope you're doing well. As our team reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached file – which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent.

Thanks very much,

Hi

Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week – I think you were able to transmit the scanned records to , but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was included).

Another person on our team, , who's copied, jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via phone her number , and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end.

thanks again!
