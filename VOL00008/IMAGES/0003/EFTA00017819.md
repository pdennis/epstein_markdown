- DK is one of the Dechert attorneys conducting the Apollo internal investigation regarding Leon Black's relationship with Epstein. Mandate is to understand what the relationship was between the two men and why Black was paying Epstein money. Looks to be Epstein was being paid for some reason other than the services he was providing.
- DK reaching out to ask SDNY if there is anything available publicly that would shed any light on either Black's relationship with Epstein and/or Epstein's source of expertise to charge money. DK made clear he is not asking for SDNY to provide anything that is not public or would not be ordinarily accessible by third parties.
- ☐ indicated would check with team and get back to DK.
