Yes, I believe we have all of the transcripts from all of the depositions in the Roberts v. Maxwell civil suit. They are on the Epstein share drive. I don't have my laptop with me, so I can't send them via email. Do you have access to the share? If so, I can tell you where to look for them there.

Separate from [REDACTED] - do you all have the full transcripts of the depositions? At various points [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] have asked me to find transcripts and I've only found excerpts from summary judgement exhibits unsealed by the 2nd circuit.

She was deposed, but she invoked 5 throughout. We have the transcript, but it's just her asserting the privilege over and over.

Hey Guys – Not sure if any of you are around this week, but if so, quick question from [REDACTED] -- do you know if [REDACTED] was deposed as part of the Roberts-Maxwell litigation and, if so, do we have a transcript?

Thanks,
