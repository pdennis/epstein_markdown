Hi

I wanted to let you know that I just received a call from [redacted], an attorney in Florida, who reached out to me to say that he met with [redacted] and may be representing them in connection with our investigation and possible civil litigation. I said that I could not discuss this further, gave him your contact information, and encouraged him to reach out to you directly to sort this out. I just wanted to let you know because I expect he'll reach out to you.

If you have any questions for us or if a call would be helpful, please let us know.

Best,

[redacted]
