Hi

In response to the letter we filed yesterday, today Maxwell's counsel filed her own letter demanding that Judge Nathan order the Warden of the MDC to appear for a court proceeding to address the defense's complaints about Maxwell's conditions of confinement. Judge Nathan endorsed that letter with an order that the parties confer and provide another update letter by Tuesday 12/1. Attached is the defense letter with Judge Nathan's endorsement.

Would you be available tomorrow (11/25) afternoon to discuss, please? Apologies for the late request, but we are hoping to address this before the Thanksgiving holiday.

Thanks very much,

Assistant United States Attorney
