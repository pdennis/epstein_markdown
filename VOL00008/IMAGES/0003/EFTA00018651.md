Hey guys,

We've had a bunch of discussions with brass in last day about this and assigned _______________________________________________________________ to look at things, including what effect (if any) the Florida NPA has on us (legally it turns out none). Meant to loop you in today – let's also chat separately.

Either of those times work for me. [REDACTED] and I have a meeting at 2 so 3:30 would be better if possible.

All,

We’ve been able to gather some information on the Jeff Epstein matter and I’d suggest we have a call to determine the way forward. Does 3:00 or 3:30 today work?

Have you seen this article?

Have any insight? From the article is sounds like he cooperated in a financial fraud case and was non-prosd.

[REDACTED] and I can chat whenever.
