Hi — Just a heads up that the Maxwell team is going to seek your approval this morning to issue a friendly subpoena to counsel for Minor Victim-4, the latest victim whose abuse gives rise to the superseder, for a non-privileged materials related to her settlement with Epstein back in 2008 or thereabouts. As you can imagine, we think we need this stuff both to prepare for trial but also as potential Giglio for the witness, and her lawyer is happy to provide it to us but believes he needs a subpoena.

Happy to chat further if that would be helpful, but otherwise will have the team send you an email shortly so you can approve.

Thanks,
