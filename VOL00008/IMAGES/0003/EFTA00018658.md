Subject: Referral of MLAT Request from France

Dear __________

I hope you are both doing well, and have been enjoying the end of year festivities.

I am referring for your attention an MLAT request from the French in relation to their investigation of __________ (who was recently arrested and placed under examination here in Paris). Since I have been in touch anyway with __________ and __________ about the Maxwell bail proceedings, I took the opportunity to mention that this might be coming their way.

Thanks in advance, and happy new year! -
