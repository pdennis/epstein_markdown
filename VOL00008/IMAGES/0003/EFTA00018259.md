Dr. Hughes,

Together with colleagues [redacted] and [redacted] I'm one of the federal prosecutors handling the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 2021 in the Southern District of New York. We would be interested in speaking with you about your availability to testify as an expert witness at trial. Are you available for a call tomorrow or next week to discuss?

Thanks very much,

[redacted]
