,

sent me a CD he received, which is called “Epstein Murder Evidence.” I saved the contents here:
\\usa.doj.gov\cloud\nys\StAndrews\Shared\InReEpsteinDeath-2019R01059\CD sent by mail

It appears to us to be materials from a crazy person and, as such, does not need to be produced. That said, there’s likely no harm in producing it to the defense. We are inclined to not produce it, but we wanted to run it by you first. Thoughts?

Thanks,
