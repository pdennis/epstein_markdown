Hi

I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning.

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

I hope you are doing well. We still have not received a response to our inquiry from April of 2020. Would you be available for a call with our team next week to discuss, please?

Thanks,

Hi Jeff,

No, I don't think you responded. Totally understandable given everything that has gone on in the last month. I'd still be grateful if you could get back to me on this point, please.

Hope you are also staying safe and healthy.

Hi

Did we ever respond to you on this question? Things have gotten so complicated that I can't remember or determine.

Hope you are staying safe and healthy.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff and George,

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for any students at Interlochen?

Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues [redacted] and [redacted] (both cc'd) should be able to coordinate with you as needed.

Best,
Maurene

Jeff,

As discussed, attached please find a subpoena addressed to Interlochen seeking information regarding Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Per our conversation, we understand that Interlochen will keep this request confidential.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best,
Maurene
