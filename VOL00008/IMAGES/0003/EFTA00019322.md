I don't believe it's public, or at least not that I could find anywhere. His attorneys just sent it to us.

That is incredible. This is a public document?

It's extremely notable that his attorneys are talking about how they're not satisfied with the medical examiner's conclusion that his death was by suicide when they know full well, as reflected in the attached, that he updated his will the day before he died. (He also appears to have reorganized the structure of his assets also on August 8 – see the references to the "1953 Trust" apparently established on that date; note that 1953 is the year he was born.)

In terms of other useful information, for all the cloak and dagger about who the executor was, it turns out it's his two main lawyers, Indyke and Kahn, who handle virtually all of his business activities (and of whom we were already well aware). It appears that those executors have the ability to deal with claims against the estate or its assets.

As for where his assets actually go, it all goes to the "acting Trustees of the 1953 Trust" – i.e., nobody is named herein.

FYI below, re: probating the estate. Based on a quick search I don't see any place where a probate petition would be publicly filed, though entirely possible it's somewhere I couldn't find.
