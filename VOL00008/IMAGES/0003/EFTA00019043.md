Good morning-

The melding of our respective questionnaires has posed difficulties.

For purposes of today’s conferral, attached is your version of the questionnaire with slight edits in track change.

Also attached is draft of our (far more robust) proposed questionnaire in Word (formatting to be corrected.)

Our proposed questionnaire incorporates portions of your proposed voir dire, which would be redundant if covered by a written questionnaire.

We are working on a more inclusive version of proposed voir dire questions for this afternoon's conferral.
