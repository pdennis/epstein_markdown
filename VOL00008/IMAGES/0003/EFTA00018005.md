I've completed reviewing all 114 documents on the other Relativity platform for this case (FBI files, etc.). There are some FedEx business records certificates, in case that's useful. I found the handbook from [redacted] which is attached for Monday's interview with him. As we discussed, there appear to be some Maxwell phone records.
