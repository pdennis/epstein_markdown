Thanks,

Hi [Redacted].

In connection with a criminal discovery matter, my colleagues and I were hoping to track down a list of all Jeffrey Epstein-related FOIA requests, which we understand are tracked through EOUSA [Redacted] recommended that we reach out to you, in the hopes that you might be able to help us pull together a list (or help us connect with someone who can gather that information). We'd very much appreciate any information or guidance you might have.

Thanks so much,
