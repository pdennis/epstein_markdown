TO BE FILED UNDER SEAL

Agent Affidavit in Support of Application for Search and Seizure Warrant

DISTRICT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS) ss.:

[redacted] being duly sworn, deposes and says:

I. Introduction

A. Affiant

1. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") since 2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement officer" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged in enforcing the criminal laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search warrant. I have been employed by the FBI for approximately two years, and I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the sexual exploitation of children. I have gained expertise in this area through classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of sex trafficking cases, and have participated in the execution of search warrants for physical premises.

2. I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the "Subject Premises") for the purpose of seizing the items and information described in Attachment A. This affidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and my conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted

2017.08.02

EFTA00020141

for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated.

## B. The Subject Premises

3. The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, and any closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre island located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject Premises is depicted in the following photograph:

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Based on my conversations with a law enforcement agent who has reviewed publicly available satellite information, images, and drone videos, I am aware that the Subject Premises contains multiple structures, including but not limited to:

2017.08.02

EFTA00020142

a. On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to a pool.

b. On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls.

c. On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns.

d. A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by coastline on two of its sides.

e. A second larger structure ("Residence Two") is set between the Main Residence and the coastline.

f. Four smaller single story structures (the "Four Cabanas") are next to the Main Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs.

g. A third large structure ("Residence Three") set off from the four smaller structures and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas.

h. Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the end of a wooden dock (the "Dock House").

2017.08.02

EFTA00020143

i. There are two single story sheds (“Shed One” and “Shed Two”) that are located just southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior that is a green-blue color.

j. Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several sally port type doors (“Maintenance One”). A second structure (“Maintenance Two”) is next to Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single white doors.

k. Near the center of the island is a single story structure (“Residence Four”) that has a stone exterior and blue roof. The front of “Residence Four” has three dark double doors.

l. Next to the helicopter landing pad are two small blue roof structures (“Helipad Buildings”).

m. On the west side of the Subject Premises on the coast is an approximately two-level structure (“Residence Five”) with a blue roof.

4. As detailed further herein, at least through his death on August 10, 2019, the Subject Premises was believed to be owned, possessed, and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN.

## C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses

5. For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the “Subject Offenses”). The Target Subjects of this investigation are known and unknown co-conspirators of JEFFREY EPSTEIN, including but not limited to [redacted].

2017.08.02

EFTA00020144

## II. Probable Cause and the Initial Search Warrants

### A. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject’s Commission of the Subject Offenses

6. On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in this Southern District of New York returned an Indictment charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with violations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors); and Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy). A copy of the Indictment is attached hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated by reference. EPSTEIN was arrested pursuant to the Indictment on or about July 6, 2019, and had been detained pending trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (“MCC”) in New York, New York.

7. On or about August 10, 2019, the Bureau of Prisons confirmed that JEFFREY EPSTEIN had been found unresponsive in his cell at the MCC that morning, and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.

8. Notwithstanding EPSTEIN’s death, the sex trafficking investigation that led to his indictment remains ongoing. In particular, Count One of the Indictment alleged that EPSTEIN conspired with others to traffic minors, and further identified three individuals who worked for EPSTEIN (identified in Exhibit A as “Employee-1”, “Employee-2,” and “Employee-3”) and facilitated EPSTEIN’s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, arranging victims’ encounters with EPSTEIN and paying victims after these encounters. The individual identified in Exhibit A as “Employee-2” is [redacted] a target subject of this investigation.

9. As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in Manhattan, New York; West Palm Beach, Florida; and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present,

2017.08.02

EFTA00020145

EPSTEIN possessed and controlled a residence, which is described in Exhibit A as “the New York Residence.”

10. As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous minor victims at the New York Residence. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a victim arrived at the New York Residence, she would be escorted to a room inside the New York Residence with a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the “massage.” During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as ![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg) EPSTEIN typically would also ![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg) Following each encounter, EPSTEIN or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash.

11. As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform “massages” and similarly engage in sex acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his victims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age.

12. One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of the FBI’s investigation of EPSTEIN, I have participated in interviews with Victim-1, along with

2017.08.02

EFTA00020146

other law enforcement officers.¹ Based on my participation in those interviews and my conversations with other law enforcement officers, I know that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in substance and in part:

a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on multiple occasions in the New York Residence. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was under the age of 18.

b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the New York Residence and numerous individual rooms within the New York Residence. Victim-1 has provided detailed descriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including Victim-1’s memory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of various areas within the Subject Premises. Among other details, Victim-1 recalled that EPSTEIN typically abused her in a room she described as a “massage room,” (the “Massage Room”), which contained a massage table, and was decorated with artwork depicting naked women, hung on walls that appeared to be adorned with fabric. In describing the sexual abuse that occurred in the Massage Room, Victim-1 has stated that EPSTEIN would often

Information provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent evidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of other victims whom Victim-1 has never met.

2017.08.02

EFTA00020147

13. On or about July 6, 2019, the Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of the New York Residence. The search warrant is attached as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein.

14. At approximately 6 p.m. on or about July 6, 2019, law enforcement officers (the "Search Team") commenced executing the search warrant at the New York Residence. JEFFREY EPSTEIN had been arrested on the charges contained in the Indictment shortly before the execution of the search warrant. Based on the Search Team's observations during an initial search of the New York Residence, at approximately 7 p.m., the Search Team stopped the search and froze the scene in order to seek a new search warrant. On or about July 7, 2019, the Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of the New York Residence (the "Second Warrant"). The Second Warrant is attached as Exhibit C, and incorporated by reference herein. At approximately 2:30 a.m., the Search Team resumed the search, and commenced searching pursuant to the Second Warrant. Later on July 7, 2019, the Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a third search warrant to search and seize certain electronic media stored on discs seized during the execution of the Second Warrant (the "Compact Disc Search Warrant"). The search warrant is attached as Exhibit D, and incorporated by reference herein.

15. During the execution of the warrants described above on the New York Residence, the Search Team located evidence of the Subject Offenses. In particular, the Search Team located the following, among other items:

c. Inside the Subject Premises, I observed a room that, based on my participation in interviews of Victim-1, appears to be consistent with Victim-1's descriptions of the Massage Room. The room contained a table covered with a sheet, and appeared to be a massage table. The

2017.08.02

EFTA00020148

room also contained several vibrating sex toys. The walls appeared to be covered in a type of felt-like tapestry fabric. I further observed two paintings and three photographs hanging on the walls of the Massage Room. The paintings and photographs depict nude females. One of the photographs appears to depict a nude girl. Thus, it appears that the Massage Room was in substantially the same condition as Victim-1 observed the room more than 18 years ago.

d. Inside a safe in a closet on the third floor, the Search team discovered and seized, among other items, several binders containing sleeves of compact discs, most of which are labeled with handwriting. In total, the binders contain dozens of compact discs. Some discs contain the word "Zorro" or "LSJ." Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have participated in this investigation, I believe the name "Zorro" refers to Zorro Ranch, EPSTEIN's property in New Mexico, and the name LSJ refers to Little Saint James, i.e., the Subject Premises. The majority of the discs contain titles that include female names. Some of the discs in the binders seized by the Search Team have titles that appear to refer to trips or vacations.

e. In the drawer of a dresser in a room on the Fifth floor of the New York Residence, the Search team discovered and seized, among other items, a shoebox (the "Shoebox") containing numerous compact discs. The majority of the discs are labeled, in handwriting, with female names. One disc is marked "Thai Massage." Another disc is marked "Blonde Girl Photo Shoot." Yet another disc is marked "Misc. Girls Nude/Dinner--Scientists." The discs in the Shoebox were seized by the Search Team. In another drawer of that same dresser, the Search Team discovered loose polaroid photographs depicting young, nude females who, based on the training and experience of law enforcement officers who observed them, appear to be teenagers.

f. In a closet on the Fifth Floor of the Epstein Residence, the Search Team discovered, among other items, a box marked "women/old photos." The box contained, among other items,

2017.08.02

EFTA00020149

approximately seven compact discs, which are labeled with hand-written titles. One disc is marked "nudes 00-24." Another is labeled "Photographer--[redacted]" "03" The remaining discs contain titles that include female names. All of the foregoing discs were seized by the Search Team.

g. In that same closet, the Search Team discovered numerous black binders containing what appear to be print outs of digital photographs (with file names underneath) and compact discs. The binders appeared to contain, among other photographs, photographs of nude or partially nude young girls, some of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on the training and experience of law enforcement officers who observed them, some of the young girls appear to be teenagers, some of whom appear to be under the age of 18.

16. Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have conducted an initial review (the "Reviewing Agents") of the compact discs seized at the New York Residence as described in paragraphs 15(b)-(e) above (the "Seized Discs"), I have learned that the discs contain approximately thousands of nude or partially nude photographs of girls or young women, many of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on my conversations with the Reviewing Agents, who have particular training and experience relating to child erotica and visual depictions of children in child exploitation cases, I have learned that the Reviewing Agents believe that many of the nude or partially nude images they have reviewed appear to depict girls under the age of 18. Certain of these images appear to have been taken at a tropical location, and/or were labeled "LSJ" either in the image file name, or on the compact disc that contained the image. Based on the foregoing, I believe that a portion of the foregoing photographs appear to have been taken at the Subject Premises. In addition, I have learned that some of the file names are marked [redacted] which are the initials of [redacted]. As set forth below, I have interviewed an individual who has

2017.08.02

EFTA00020150

reported that [blown through text] photographed her at the Subject Premises. Accordingly, I believe that a portion of these photos may have been taken by [blown through text].

17. On or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a series of articles relating to the defendant, his sexual misconduct with minors, and a previous investigation into his conduct in Florida from in or about 2005 through 2008. The article included information about [blown through text]'s role in EPSTEIN's sexual abuse of minors. Based on my participation in this investigation, I have learned that bank records obtained by the Government appear to show that just days later, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from a trust account to [blown through text]. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests that EPSTEIN was attempting to influence [blown through text], who might provide information against him in light of the recently re-emerging allegations.

## B. Probable Cause Regarding the Subject Premises

18. Based on my review of property records, I believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN has been the owner of the Subject Premises since at least the time of the Subject Offenses. In particular, it appears that an entity named "L.S.J., LLC" held title to the Subject Premises from in or about 1998. In or about 2011, L.S.J., LLC transferred title to the Subject Premises to an entity named "Nautilus, Inc.," for $10. On the transfer paperwork, EPSTEIN signed as the "sole member" of L.S.J., LLC and as the "president and sole beneficial owner" of Nautilus, Inc.

19. In addition, I believe that up until recently, the Subject Premises was JEFFREY EPSTEIN's principal residence. In particular, I have reviewed sex offender registration data, and have learned that, on or about June 17, 2019, EPSTEIN listed the Subject Premises as his primary residence. At the time of EPSTEIN's arrest on or about July 6, 2019, I and other law enforcement officers conducted an inventory search of EPSTEIN's personal effects, and observed that

2017.08.02

EFTA00020151

EPSTEIN was carrying a driver’s license that listed the Subject Premises as EPSTEIN’s home address.

20. As discussed herein, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses will be found at the Subject Premises. In particular, based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have conducted an initial review of the Seized Discs, I have learned the following:

a. Many of the photographs appear to be labeled with file names that include “LSJ,” which I believe stands for Little St. James.

b. As discussed above, photographs seized from the New York Residence appear to depict nude or partially nude young girls, and a portion of those photos appear to have been taken at the Subject Premises, based on the fact that (i) some of the photos appear to have been taken in a tropical location, and (ii) some of the file names of the photographs and/or the labels on the discs containing the files of nude or partially nude young girls in a tropical location are marked “LSJ,” i.e., the Subject Premises.

c. Among the photographs seized from the New York Residence, the Reviewing Agents identified partially-nude photographs of a young girl, labeled with the name of a particular individual (“Individual-1”). The photographs appear to depict Individual-1 on a beach in what appears to be a tropical location.

21. In or about July 2019, I participated in an interview of Individual-1, with her counsel present. Based on my personal observations, I believe that the photographs described in Paragraph 17(c) depict Individual-1. During the course of the interview, Individual-1 stated that she met EPSTEIN in 2003 when she was approximately 17, and that she travelled to EPSTEIN’s properties in New Mexico, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, i.e., the Subject Premises, before

2017.08.02

EFTA00020152

she turned 18. EPSTEIN paid for the trips, and would give Individual-1 money and gifts while she traveled with him.

22. During these trips, EPSTEIN sexually abused and assaulted her on approximately four different occasions, all of which occurred before she turned 18. Individual-1 reported that EPSTEIN raped her during two of these incidents. Individual-1 recalled that one or more of these instances of sexual abuse occurred on the Subject Premises. Individual-1 further reported that, when she was approximately 17, [redacted] asked to photograph her, and did in fact photograph Individual-1 at the Subject Premises.

23. In or about August 2019, I and another law enforcement officer interviewed an individual (“Individual-2”) who regularly performed work for JEFFREY EPSTEIN as a contractor at the Subject Premises from approximately 1999 to 2005 or 2006. Individual-2 reported that, on several occasions, Individual-2 observed photographs of what appeared to be nude or partially nude young girls in several locations throughout the main residence of the Subject Premises. Individual-2 recalled a photograph depicting [redacted] and two of girls, all of three whom were topless; Individual-2 estimated that the two girls in the photograph appeared to be approximately 15 or 16 years old. Individual-2 knew [redacted] to be EPSTEIN’s assistant at that time.

24. Based on my review of flight logs from a private jet owned by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, I have learned that [redacted] traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands at least approximately once a month between October 2001 and November of 2005. These records do not include any travel [redacted] may have taken on commercial airlines.

25. For all of these reasons, I am aware that [redacted] has spent significant time at the Subject Premises and that evidence of her involvement, and potentially the involvement

2017.08.02

EFTA00020153

of other co-conspirators, may be located at the Subject Premises. In particular, flight logs from EPSTEIN’s private jet reflect that the individual identified in the Indictment as “Employee-3” traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands on approximately nine separate occasions. These records do not include any travel Employee-3 may have taken on commercial airlines. As set forth in the Indictment, Employee-3 scheduled victims’ encounters with EPSTEIN.

26. Based on my training, experience, and participation in this investigation, I believe that there is probable cause that evidence of the Subject Offenses, such as photographs of EPSTEIN’s victims and co-conspirators, will be found at the Subject Premises. In particular, information provided by Individual-1, with whom EPSTEIN engaged in sex acts at the Subject Premises while Individual-1 was a minor, confirms that EPSTEIN engaged in conduct relevant to the Subject Offenses at the Subject Premises. In addition, photographs on the Seized Discs recovered during the search of the New York Residence depict other young and partially nude girls photographed at the Subject Premises, which suggests that EPSTEIN brought those girls to the Subject Premises and that, consistent with the accounts provided by Individual-1, Victim-1 and other victims identified in the Indictment, EPSTEIN likely sexually abused them at the Subject Premises as well. Evidence of co-conspirators’ presence at the Subject Premises at times when victims were abused, including photographs, may also be found at the Subject Premises. Indeed, as noted above, Individual-2 has observed a photograph of [redacted] partially-nude young girls at the Subject Premises.

27. Moreover, while the sexual abuse described above occurred principally between approximately 2002 and 2005, as evidence recovered from the New York Residence including the Seized Discs makes clear, EPSTEIN continued to maintain substantial evidence of the Subject Offenses up until the time he was arrested in 2019. Indeed, as described above, in addition to the

2017.08.02

EFTA00020154

Seized Discs, Epstein continued to maintain a “massage room” complete with a massage table and various sex toys that remained similar in makeup and appearance to descriptions of the same room provided by Victim-1 based on Victim-1’s encounters with EPSTEIN in 2004.

28. In addition, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses, including but not limited to photographs/evidence created at the Subject Premises, may be located not only at the New York Residence but also at the Subject Premises because (i) the Subject Premises was the location of multiple photo shoots of young girls; (ii) the Subject Premises appears to have been, for the last several years and up until the time of his arrest, EPSTEIN’s primary residence; and (iii) given its location, the Subject Premises is JEFFREY EPSTEIN’s most private residence. Therefore, given that EPSTEIN has maintained evidence of the Subject Offenses, he is likely to have maintained some of that evidence in or on the Subject Premises. Moreover, given that there is probable cause to believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN and others, including [redacted], conspired to commit the Subject Offenses, evidence of EPSTEIN’s involvement in trafficking minors would also be relevant to the investigation of, and any future charges against, other members of the conspiracy, such as [redacted].

29. According to international flight records that I have reviewed, a private jet owned and utilized by Epstein has traveled to or from the U.S. Virgin Islands at least on or about April 14, 2019; May 5, 2019; May 18, 2019; and June 11, 2019. Accordingly, there is probable cause to believe that EPSTEIN recently has been present at the Subject Premises.

30. Based on my training and experience in investigating individuals who engage in sex trafficking of minors, and who sexually exploit minors, such individuals often maintain photographs of their victims, and/or other erotic images of minors, at their residences. Individuals

2017.08.02

EFTA00020155

who engage in such offenses often hoard such images in the privacy of their residences. In particular, data related to their illegal activity is often stored on their computers.

31. In my training and experience, individuals who store nude and/or sexually suggestive photographs of minors on compact discs or other external storage devices typically access those images from computers and other electronic devices in order to view those images, and individuals who store such materials on compact discs typically store similar files on other computing devices and storage devices.

32. Based on my training and experience, I also know that, where computers are used in furtherance of criminal activity, evidence of the criminal activity can often be found months or even years after it occurred. This is typically true because:

- Electronic files can be stored on a hard drive for years at little or no cost and users thus have little incentive to delete data that may be useful to consult in the future.
- Even when a user does choose to delete data, the data can often be recovered months or years later with the appropriate forensic tools. When a file is "deleted" on a home computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear, but instead remains on the hard drive, in "slack space," until it is overwritten by new data that cannot be stored elsewhere on the computer. Similarly, files that have been viewed on the Internet are generally downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or "cache," which is only overwritten as the "cache" fills up and is replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve from a hard drive or other electronic storage media depends less on when the file was created or viewed than on a particular user's operating system, storage capacity, and computer habits.
- In the event that a user changes computers, the user will typically transfer files from the old computer to the new computer, so as not to lose data. In addition, users often keep backups of their data on electronic storage media such as thumb drives, flash memory cards, CD-ROMs, or portable hard drives.

## C. Return of ESI

33. If the Government determines that the electronic devices are no longer necessary to retrieve and preserve the data, and the devices themselves are not subject to seizure pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c), the Government will return these items, upon request.

2017.08.02

EFTA00020156

Computer data that is encrypted or unreadable will not be returned unless law enforcement personnel have determined that the data is not (i) an instrumentality of the offense, (ii) a fruit of the criminal activity, (iii) contraband, (iv) otherwise unlawfully possessed, or (v) evidence of the Subject Offenses.

## III. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions

34. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses, and in particular the items described in Attachment A, will be located within the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the items and information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure Warrant.

## I. Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises

The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, and any closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre island located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject Premises is depicted in the following photograph:

![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)

The Subject Premises contains multiple structures, including but not limited to:

a. On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to a pool.
b. On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls.
c. On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns.
d. A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by coastline on two of its sides.

2017.08.02

EFTA00020162

e. A second larger structure (“Residence Two”) is set between the Main Residence and the coastline.

f. Four smaller single story structures (the “Four Cabanas”) are next to the Main Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs.

g. A third large structure (“Residence Three”) set off from the four smaller structures and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas.

h. Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the end of a wooden dock (the “Dock House”).

i. There are two single story sheds (“Shed One” and “Shed Two”) that are located just southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior that is a green-blue color.

j. Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several sally port type doors (“Maintenance One”). A second structure (“Maintenance Two”) is next to Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single white doors.

k. Near the center of the island is a single story structure (“Residence Four”) that has a stone exterior and blue roof. The front of Residence Four has three dark double doors.

l. Next to the helicopter landing pad are two small structures with blue roofs (“Helipad Buildings”).

m. On the west side of the Subject Premises on the coast is an approximately two-level structure with a blue roof (“Residence Five”).

## II. Items to Be Seized

### A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses
