Chiefs – FYI, OIA got back to us this morning confirming the accuracy of the highlighted language and attaching a letter from MOJ. See attached. I requested that the letter be translated on an expedited basis. I think we may be able to strengthen the second highlighted sentence and cite to the last paragraph of MOJ's letter, but I'm awaiting the translation.

Thanks __________, we had a couple of additional comments but this looks good. We'd like you guys to send to __________ tonight, so I think it's fine to keep the caveat about OIA/highlighted language in there while she reviews. Thanks again.

Chiefs,

Attached is an updated draft of the opposition for your review. Our OIA contact in the UK had no edits on the language in the attached. As indicated in the attached, the OIA contact in France is still waiting on feedback from MOJ; if we don't get confirmation, we will remove the highlighted language.

Thanks,

Some combined comments and questions in track. I would like to see again at some point, and I think ☐ will want to see as well. But hopefully this should permit you to get the relevant section to OIA in the morning.

Chiefs,

Hope you both had a nice weekend. Attached for your review is a draft of our opposition to the third bail application, also attached for your convenience. As noted in the draft, we are still waiting on feedback from OIA re France so that section is subject to change. We also plan to send the section on citizenship renunciation to OIA to make sure they review for accuracy (as we did with our last opposition). Given the time difference and our filing deadline of Tuesday, we are hoping to send this to them sometime tomorrow morning, but of course, happy to discuss.

Thanks,

☐
