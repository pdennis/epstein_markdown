Thanks. And in either the state or federal action, has there been motion practice in which deposition transcripts have been filed? Motion for summary judgement, for example?

&gt; It's in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. It's not the lawsuit the victims filed against the government to invalidate the NPA. And it's not one of the suits the victims filed against Epstein. It's a lawsuit that an attorney who represented multiple victims filed against Epstein for malicious prosecution. Sort of a complicated background: previously Epstein sued the lawyer, claiming that the lawyer was involved in an unrelated fraud that the lawyer's law partner was convicted of-- the fraud related to an Epstein business. The lawyer is now suing Epstein for malicious prosecution, claiming that he wrongfully filed the old lawsuit in retaliation for representing Epstein's victims.

&gt; The December 4 trial - is that the one against DOJ or against Epstein? State or federal court?
