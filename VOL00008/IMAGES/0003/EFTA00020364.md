Subject: GM bank accounts

With apologies for the quick turn around on this, could you please send us a list of all known bank accounts held in Maxwell's name (or otherwise associated with her)? For those accounts, please provide the last year/month we have account statements for, whether we know if the account is still open, and the account balance as of that statement. On the list, please include accounts that we are aware of but do not yet have information for. If you could please send this today, that would be ideal.

Thanks!
