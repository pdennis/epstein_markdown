Good afternoon
This case is scheduled for trial on July 12, 2021? If so, would you be able to give me a brief summary for Dr. Cooper to review? Once she has a chance to review it, I will be happy to schedule a conference call between you.
Thanks for your kind consideration.
Warm regards,

Legal &amp; Conference Coordinator

Good afternoon,
My colleagues, [redacted] and [redacted], and I are the prosecutors in the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 2020 in the Southern District of New York. We are reaching out because we would be interested in speaking with Dr. Cooper about potentially testifying at trial. Would it be possible to schedule a call with Dr. Cooper to discuss?
Thanks very much,
