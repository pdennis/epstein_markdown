Counsel,

We owe the Court a proposed protective order by noon for the materials responsive to your Rule 17 subpoena. Attached is a draft of a short order which just applies the provisions of our existing protective order to these materials.

Please either send us a redline so we can discuss or let us know if you agree.

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
