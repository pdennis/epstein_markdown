Re: United States v. Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, No. 19 Cr. 830

Dear Counsel:

We write in response to your discovery request letters, dated January 29, 2020. This letter and the content herein is designated as “Protected Materials” pursuant to the Protective Order entered in this matter.

Thomas Request. The Government refers to its prior response to this request, as stated at the November 25, 2019 pretrial conference.

Noel Requests No. 1-10, 12-13. We note, at the outset, that many of these requests are extremely broad and pertain to information that does not appear to be relevant to the case. To the extent material called for by these requests is within the Government’s possession and subject to disclosure at this time, the Government has already disclosed such information to you, including by letter dated January 24, 2020. To the extent these requests call for information that is not currently in the Government’s possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis or authority for these requests, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or disclose this information.

Noel Request No. 11. The name of the MCC technician referenced in the Government’s previous letter is Hughwon Daniel.

Noel Request No. 16. The Government has already produced the available video surveillance in its possession for July 23, 2019 for the Special Housing Unit. The Government attaches hereto two public filings in United States v. Tartaglione, 16 Cr. 832 (KMK), which reference these issues.

Noel Requests No. 14-5, 17-23. These requests, in general terms, call for information about where particular evidence may be located within the discovery produced to date. As you note, you seek this information to “assist in expediting the ability of the defense to be ready for trial.” Accordingly, with respect to Noel Requests No. 14-15, 17-23, at your request and solely as a courtesy to aid you in your review of discovery, the Government is providing the information that follows. The Government’s response to your requests should not be used for any other purpose, nor should it be construed as a representation that only these files or portions of the surveillance video are potentially relevant to the Government’s case or any potential defense, or as a representation that the identified portions are the only portions of surveillance video that would be responsive to your requests. The Government expressly reserves the right to identify and/or offer at trial additional material as probative of any of the issues identified in these requests.

Noel Request No. 14. With respect to August 9, 2019, we direct your attention to the following video files: CH0080_20190809195956; CH0080_20190809205956, CH0080_20190809215956; CH0080_20190809225956.
