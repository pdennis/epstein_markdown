Counsel,

Our proposed joint voir dire and jury questionnaire are due on October 11. Please find attached our draft proposals. If you have disagreements/proposed changes, please note them in track changes. Please send these back to us by COB October 7 so that we have time to review before submitting to the Court.

Thank you,
