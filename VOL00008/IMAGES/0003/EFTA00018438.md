The decision and order denying Mr. Epstein’s application, which was publicly filed on the case docket, is attached. Just to be clear, we take absolutely no position on any State Department or other extra-judicial processes relating to Mr. Epstein —I’m sending this publicly-filed document just as a courtesy. I don’t know if individuals have any due process or any other rights in connection with their passports (and have never previously had a defendant who had his or her passport revoked upon arrest and/or detention), and so do not have any view or position on the determinations of any other department or agency. All that said, the order is attached, which I hope that is useful.

thank you,

Would you be able to send me a copy of the detention order? Consular Affairs will use the order to revoke his passport. Even though he is incarcerated, the State Department would like to revoke his U.S. passport.

Thanks.
