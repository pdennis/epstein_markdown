Good afternoon-

I write to request immediate assistance for Ghislaine Maxwell.

There are many conditions and restrictions placed upon her at the MDC that are of great complaint, but of immediate concern are conditions within Ms. Maxwell’s isolation cell.

The combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement in her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable.

Her request for an extra blanket has been denied.

Her request for use of her day mug for water has been denied.

(She’s been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.)

Her request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied.

The moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security of her legal work.

You have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court.

Trust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented individuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in MCC’s 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I have never witnessed such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. The mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, and the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better.

For today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe from the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. The rest will be left for another day.

Please assist.

Thank you-

Bobbi
