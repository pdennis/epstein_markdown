We can be available tomorrow at 4:30. Please let me know if you would like for me and the vendor to call you or do you want to circulate a conference call for 4:30?

Hi [REDACTED],

Would a call at 4:30pm work?

Hello [REDACTED],

Me and the vendor (PAE) need to talk to you about the scanning data to be loaded to Relativity. Please let me know when you have time to talk today.

Thank you.
