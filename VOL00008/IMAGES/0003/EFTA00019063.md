Good afternoon,

I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court (EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly that there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied.

So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from our firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make another request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than address the Curcio issue.

Thank you.
