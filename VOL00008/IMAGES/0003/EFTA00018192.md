Jack,

Attached is a motion that Maxwell's has counsel filed seeking to subpoena information from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund, including information about [redacted]. We intend to file a motion to quash the subpoena later this week. Happy to have a call if you would like to discuss or have any questions.

Thanks,
