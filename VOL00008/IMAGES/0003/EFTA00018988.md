Hey

I'm so sorry to do this but I just caught something on the cover letter. The initial bates range in the index reads SDNY_GM_02742936 when it should instead be SDNY_GM_02742963. I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to email the updated cover to defense?

Thanks,

Counsel,

Pursuant to the Court's Order dated November 18, 2020, today we are producing materials regarding victims who are not referenced in Indictment number S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. The production is small enough to produce via an FTP site. Would you please send us a link to use for this production?

We send a CD containing a copy of this production to the MDC for your client to review as well.

Best,

Assistant United States Attorney Southern District of New York
