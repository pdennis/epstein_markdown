Also, I have some availability tomorrow before noon or after 3:00pm, if that works better.

Please let me know what works for you and if you'd like a CV and fee schedule in the interim.

Best,

Kim

Dr. Mehlman-Orozco,

My colleagues, and I are the prosecutors in the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 2020 in the Southern District of New York. We would be interested in speaking with you about your availability to testify at trial. Are you available for a call this week to discuss?

Thanks very much,
