Hi

Thanks very much for your assistance with this search warrant. I've attached the application, along with the exhibits to the affidavit.

The affiant will be Special Agent [redacted] who is copied here. She is available tomorrow at any time that is convenient for Judge Miller.

Thanks again for your help, and please let us know if you need any additional materials.
