Dear Ms.

As previously discussed, I am making a formal request pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(C) for any and all reports, memorandums, written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the United States Inspector General.

Please see U.S. v. Bryan, 868 F.2d 1032 (1989) if you maintain that Mr. Thomas is not entitled to the requested documents.

Respectfully yours,
