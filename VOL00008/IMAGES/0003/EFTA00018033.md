She is going to take the day off of work, so no need to do it after-hours (thank you for the offer). Let me know if you need additional availability.

Hi

No need to take any more time out of what I'm sure was a busy weekend for you. Let's set a time for Tuesday morning (the earlier the better for me). Let me know what works for you.

Thanks,

Joe

Joe,

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before you meet with , if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in touch.</mailto:></mailto:></mailto:></mailto:></mailto:></mailto:></tel:></x-apple-data-detectors:></x-apple-data-detectors:>
