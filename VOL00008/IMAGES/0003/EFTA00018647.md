Ok, thanks. Anything else you'd like me to do about these slips in the FOIA scans that note CDs weren't scanned?

Yes, we have all of these saved here on the share: \

I've reviewed all of these files, and either produced them, noted the technical difficulties to the FBI, or noted them in the list of folders to review for witness statements.

Thanks so much for confirming.

Is this just the media that, based on 1 email and our conversations,
you've already reviewed? I don't think this answers our question about CDs with things like subpoena returns, but let me know what you think.

Good afternoon AUSA 1.

The FOIA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the 1A Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever sent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. I'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need further assistance.

|  File | Type of Media | Length (hr. min. sec) | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  31E-MM-108062-1A Vol. 3
(located in GJ-1A Sec. 03, FDPS pg. 250 on T-drive) | Audio | 3:08:54 | 48 Grand Jury Testimony audio files dated 7/19/2006 (media received from the PB State Attorney's Office).  |
|  |   |   |   |
|  31E-MM-108062-1A43
(located in 1A Sec. 05, FDPS pg. 194 on T-drive) | Audio | 1:13:05 | 4/24/2007 interview of 4 by FBI SAs 5 and AUSA 6 (media received from SA 7)  |
|  |   |   |   |
|  31E-MM-108062-1A91
(located in 1A Sec. 11, FDPS pg. 83 on T-drive) | Video | 3:26:21 | 2/17/2010 deposition of Jeffrey Epstein (1 vs. Jeffrey Epstein). Media received from attorney Brad Edwards.  |

Hi

Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached file – which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent.

Thanks very much,

Hi ____________________________

Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week – I think you were able to transmit the scanned records to ____________________________ but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was included).

Another person on our team, ____________________________, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via phone her number is ____________________________, and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end.

thanks again!

Following up on our conversation from yesterday, wanted to send a quick email as promised so you have my full contact info – I'm reachable at this email address or by phone at ____________________________ (office) or ____________________________ (cell). Please don't hesitate to reach out anytime day or night if we can provide any useful info, or if you have any questions at all, and we appreciate you talking with us about the records information. Let us know if it makes sense to set up another call for Friday or early next week to check in on the questions we had, and thanks very much for your help.
