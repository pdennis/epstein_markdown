Stephen – Attached please find a copy of the Indictment obtained this morning charging two correctional officers at MCC in connection with their failures to perform their duties on the night of the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein. The attached has also now been filed with the court and is thus a public document. Please let us know if we can pass on anything else that might be of use.

Thanks.
