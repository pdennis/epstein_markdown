Hey [redacted],

Here are the documents you requested in regards to my investigation into Mr. Epstein.

On March 15, 2019 Mr. Epstein signed the Virgin Islands sex offender registry Notification of Duty to Report Travel (IML) form.

EFTA00018159

On March 22, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Vienna, Austria where he and three (3) female passengers went to coffee and it appears this travel was not reported.

On April 25, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Morocco and it appears this travel was not reported.

Please note if this information is made public I strongly believe it may hamper our ability to confirm this information as the investigation is ongoing. Especially with his resources.

Any questions, please contact me.
