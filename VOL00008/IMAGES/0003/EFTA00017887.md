Hi

Unfortunately, I have class starting here in a few minutes, and grabbing those files from the docket took longer than I would have liked.

Attached is where I was able to get to so far (I got through the bottom of page 5). I hope at least this was helpful. I have class until 9:10 tonight, so probably cannot circle back on this until tomorrow morning. Let me know if that would be helpful or if you need to get this done sooner.

Sorry again for not being able to get through more of this.

Best,

From: &lt;

Hey,

Thanks for hopping on this! Here's a portion of a brief we need citechecked. If there are cites you can't check because you don't have the documents, just highlight them and I'll check them.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!
