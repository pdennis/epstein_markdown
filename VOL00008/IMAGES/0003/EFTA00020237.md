Re: Case Number 2018R01618 and Court Docket Number

Dear [redacted]:

The enclosed information is provided by the United States Department of Justice Victim Notification System (VNS). As a victim witness professional, my role is to assist you with information and services during the prosecution of this case. You have been designated to receive notifications on behalf of the following victim(s) (or potential victims) identified by law enforcement during the investigation of the case: [redacted]

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested and charged as the result of a criminal investigation conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. These charges arise out of an investigation into potential co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein. The main charge is categorized as Project Safe Childhood. Additional information regarding the case is set forth below. The lead prosecutors on the case are [redacted]

## Victim's Rights

Although the current charges against Maxwell may not contain allegations involving you personally, the Southern District of New York previously identified you as a victim or potential victim in a related case involving Jeffrey Epstein.

Victims of all crimes under federal investigation are entitled to services under the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act (VRRA), including notification of court events. For further details, please refer to Title 34 United States Code section 20141 or the VRRA link posted at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov.

Although you may not have been identified as a victim of the specific conduct charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, for your awareness, this letter provides details regarding the rights of crime victims in federal cases. Now that charges have been filed in federal court, victims of the charges filed are, in addition, entitled to the following rights, according to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18 United States Code section 3771: (1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely

restitution as provided in law; (7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; (9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement; and (10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (34 U.S.C. 20141(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice. If you want to inform the prosecutors of your views regarding any aspect of the case, please contact one of the prosecutors listed above or me at

Please understand that these rights apply only to victims of the specific counts charged in federal court, and thus you may not be able to exercise all of these rights if the crime of which you are a victim is not within the scope of the Indictment.

Because you have not been identified as a victim of the charges filed against Maxwell, we will not provide you with additional individualized notifications about this specific case unless you request such notifications. If you wish to receive ongoing notifications regarding this case, please contact me at

Even if you do not receive individualized notifications regarding this case, we will make our best efforts to ensure you are provided the rights and services to which you are entitled. You may contact the Victim/Witness Coordinator at the office listed above if you have questions about the progress of your case, your rights or the services to which you are entitled, or how you can assert them during the proceedings. If you believe that a Justice Department employee has not provided you with these rights, you may file a complaint with the Justice Department's Victims' Rights Ombudsman. For more information, go to http://www.justice.gov/usao/resources/crime-victims-rights-ombudsman. If you have questions about filing a complaint against an employee, you may contact the Ombudsman by email at usaeo.VictimOmbudsman@usdoj.gov. Questions concerning this case should be directed to office listed above.

It is important to keep in mind that the defendant(s) are presumed innocent until proven guilty and that presumption requires both the Court and our office to take certain steps to ensure that justice is served. While our office cannot act as your attorney or provide you with legal advice, you can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights above or other related legal matters.
