[redacted], and I are traveling to West Palm Beach next week for the Epstein case. Could you please help book our travel? Here is my information—[redacted] can let you know whether she would like the same arrangements. Thanks so much for your help.

Hotel: Hilton Palm Beach, 600 Okeechobee Blvd, West Palm Beach. Checking in on 9/3 and checking out 9/4.

Conference Room: please book a conference room at the Hilton for both Tuesday and Wednesday. If they have a room called “the social” available, that would be great.

Flights:

Outbound, leaving at 920 am on 9/3 from EWR to PBI

Inbound, leaving at 6:12 pm on 9/4 from PBI to JFK

Thanks!
