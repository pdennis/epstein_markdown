Good afternoon-

Following up on this morning's conversation-

Ms. Maxwell is requesting daily legal VTCs from 12:30 - 3:30 pm

to replace legal audio calls.

Should the VTC connection fail, we request that the call be reverted to

audio during the remaining time period.

Is there a specific time and length you are looking for?

Thank you for your assistance in arranging legal video conferencing for Ms. Maxwell.

We request daily VTCs.

It is my understanding that there is a VTC terminal in the vicinity of Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell and day room area.

Please let me know if I need to arrange these through the MDC legal conferencing portal managed by FDNY.

Much appreciated.

Good afternoon-

I write again regarding my immediate need for video teleconferencing with my client GHISLAINE MAXWELL 02879-509 (SEE EMAIL BELOW).

I am informed that in-person legal visiting has been suspended due to the COVID outbreak at the facility.

It is imperative that I be able to review discovery documents with my client with via video.

Legal calls are insufficient for review of the millions of documents in this case.

Please make these arrangements immediately or provide a response that I can bring to the Court's attention.

Thank you-

Good afternoon-

I am counsel for GHISLAINE MAXWELL 02879-509

I have requested but have never received video calls with my client Ghislaine Maxwell.

[redacted] and [redacted] informed the Court that Ms. Maxwell

was provided one video call, which I confirmed occurred on August 18th but failed due to audio problems.

I am informed that the VTC occurred in a room between Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell and day room.

Yesterday, I was informed of the following-

"Unfortunately there are no VTCs on East SHU. You may reach out to [redacted] and [redacted] for further assistance in this matter."

I am requesting that videoconferences be arranged for Ms. Maxwell or provide explanation for review by the Court.

Thank you.

Hi [redacted].

Requesting assistance to arrange legal calls with my client Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509.

No response for request for visit (not sure if legal visiting suspended due to COVID outbreak.)

Am up against a filing deadline and need to review voluminous discovery with client.

Any chance for VTCs so I can review discovery client?

Otherwise daily legal calls?

Thanks for all your assistance.

Hi [redacted].

My client - Ghislaine Maxwell - 02879-509 - is in quarantine; all of her in-person legal visits have been cancelled.

Any assistance you can provide arranging daily legal calls - any time of the day - and an occasional VTC (which has been requested but never arranged) would be greatly appreciated.

This case involves voluminous discovery (the latest production is 1.2 million documents) and upcoming filing deadlines.

It is imperative that I have contact with my client.
