Good morning. I've reached out to the investigator.

I also spoke again with the Paris prosecutor's office. Looks like they are going to send us an MLAT request. I will let you know when that comes in.

Unrelatedly, OIA received the attached citizen correspondence, which I am forwarding to your attention in case there is anything here for your office or FBI.

Best,

DOJ Attaché/Magistrat de liaison américain
