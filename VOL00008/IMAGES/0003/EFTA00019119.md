All,

I wanted to follow up to ask if a call would be useful to check in – we recognize you will likely need more time to evaluate this, but it would be helpful to discuss where we are. Are you available for a call this week?

Thanks,

All,

Following up on our discussions, we wanted to send you a preliminary statement of facts, so that we can discuss whether there might be room for agreement. Whenever you're ready to discuss, please let us know when you'd like to schedule a call.

Please note that the language below isn't final from our perspective – we're happy to discuss any issues you see with the statement, and it's possible there might be modifications on our end as well. However, we wanted to have a starting point so that we could have more concrete discussions with you about whether a resolution is possible here.

As we've discussed, this isn't a plea offer, and we don't intend to issue a plea offer before notifying and consulting with victims.

Thanks,

All,

Following up on your questions about 18 U.S.C. § 1510, we wanted to let you know that it is our understanding that Section 1510 requires proof that the defendant knew the relevant law enforcement official was in fact a federal law enforcement official. See United States v. Escalera, 957 F.3d 122, 131 n.11 (2d Cir. 2020) (citing United States v. Grande, 620 F.2d 1026, 1036-37 (4th Cir. 1980) ("We read this legislative history to articulate a congressional intention that one may be found to have violated § 1510 only upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the person who was intimidated, threatened, or harmed was about to communicate information to another known by the accused to be a federal criminal investigator.")). By contrast, as we have discussed, Section 1512(b)(3) has no such requirement. If you have a different view of that issue or if there are any authorities you would like us to review, we'd be happy to look more closely at the issue.

Please let us know if you have any questions, or if a call would be useful to discuss.

Thanks,

Hi all,

Following up on our conversation last week, we wanted to send you two cases that we believe bear directly on the question you raised regarding Section 1512(b)(3). We're happy to discuss further when we speak tomorrow, but we wanted to send these to you in advance in case that's useful.

Thanks,
