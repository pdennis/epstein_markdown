Subject: Epstein Autopsy

All,

OCME just completed the autopsy and the findings are consistent with strangulation/hanging. Epstein had a broken hiatal bone and injuries to the left shoulder that are consistent with hanging. Per OCME, there is no reason to suspect that Epstein did not hang himself. OCME will wait to finalize the report until after the toxicology reports come back, and OCME has had an opportunity to review any reports of interviews of the first guards on the scene who discovered Epstein.

We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thanks.
