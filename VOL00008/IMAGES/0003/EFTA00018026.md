Subject: Response of David Oscar Markus in United States v. Maxwell 20-Cr-330

## CAUTION - EXTERNAL:

Dear Judge Nathan,

I hope this email finds you and your staff doing well.

On June 30, 2021, the Government filed a letter directed at me, and this Court ordered that I respond by today. I have not entered an appearance in this proceeding and am not a member of the Southern District of New York, so I do not have filing privileges. Accordingly, I am emailing this responsive letter to Chambers and respectfully request that it be filed on the public docket.

If the Court prefers that I have it filed it in a different fashion, please let me know.

I am, of course, also copying government counsel and defense counsel.

Have a nice weekend,

David
