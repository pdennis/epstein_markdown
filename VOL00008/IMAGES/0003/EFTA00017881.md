Hello,

Thank you again for the helpful call today. Please do send the business records certification for the [REDACTED] records you previously provided us.

As I mentioned, attached is a trial subpoena. If we end up needing you to testify, I'll be in touch in late-October to talk about logistics and to do some prep.

Thanks,

From: [REDACTED] &lt;REDACTED&gt;

Hi,

It's a follow-up conversation to the ones you had with [REDACTED] and some of my colleagues about subpoenas for student records a few months ago. Happy to explain more on the phone. When is a good time to talk?

Thanks,

Hello [REDACTED]
I hope you're doing well. I think a few months back you spoke with my colleague, [REDACTED]. Do you have a few minutes sometime for a short follow up call? We are generally available today if that works for you.
Thank you,
