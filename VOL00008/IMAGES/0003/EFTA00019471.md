Hi _______________.

The materials on the drive were extracted from devices seized from Epstein’s Manhattan residence pursuant to a search warrant.

It does not include materials seized from USVI.

Thanks,

Hello _____________________________________________________________________________________________.

Can you please let me know if there is a specific custodian for this priv review for Epstein? Also, can you please let me know where this data should be loaded into Relativity (subpoena returns or something else)?

Thank you.
