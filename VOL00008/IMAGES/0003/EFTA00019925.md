Sorry to hear that. You're correct that we didn't need his testimony.

Subject: Efrain Reyes

just learned from Probation that Efrain Reyes died. It sounds like it was in his sleep. Given his history, I think it may have been drug related, but perhaps not. Either way, my recollection is that you didn't expect to need him for anything Epstein/MCC-related, but just want to keep you in the loop in case my memory is wrong.
