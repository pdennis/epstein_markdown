Greetings Janey, grossly corrupt SEC et al.
The fraud on the SDNY courts perpetrated by the grossly corrupt SEC is staggering. Like me, Dan Kamensky never had a chance going up against the Mogilevich Bag Man Milken flunkie degenerate crew.
Phat Leon Black: Apollo as I have previously stated: very high on the SEC/DoJ "Do Not Investigate List". Milken's "right hand man at Drexel". Black, his family/Apollo controlled the ONLY Epstein SEC disclosed money

EFTA00019148

laundering shell called Environmental Solutions World Wide (ESWW).

In 2002 the SEC brought a complaint against ESWW: Fraud. With money laundering flags too numerous to count. But, in typical SEC Cover up mode: no AML complaint.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17673a.htm

Environmental Solutions Worldwide, Inc. et al.: Lit. Rel. No. 17673a / August 13, 2002 - SEC

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. Litigation Release No. 17673A / August 13, 2002 SEC Files Civil Lawsuit in $15 Million "Pump and Dump" Stock Fraud Case

www.sec.gov

So, Black, his family, and Apollo KNEW ESWW was an OTCM money laundering shell when it "invested" along side Epstein. But, Phat Leon, his family, Apollo didn't just own ESWW stock, they controlled the company

The SEC kept ESWW up and running for 13 years AFTER it filed its complaint while Black/his family/Apollo/Epstein laundered millions of dollars through this SEC declared "scam". In the end, ESWW wasn't even revoked. Rather: voluntarily withdrawn.

The ESWW CEO/Chairman was a guy named Mark Yung
Dually employed at a firm called Orchard Capital while at ESWW
Orchard was controlled by Richard Ressler. Another Mogilevich Bag Man Milken Drexel flunkie Degenerate.
Ressler went on to found Ares Management. Which, with the blessing of the SEC went public in 2014

One of these things is not like the others: Dan Kamensky is NOT on the Milken et al SEC/DoJ "Do not investigate list". He never had a chance. Kamensky was an outsider in a process only available to Milken flunkie degenerates. ESWW: a money laundering OTCM shell. Leon Black? His family? Apollo? Epstein? Yes SDNY and grossly corrupt SEC: Junk is junk. Milken is the nexus of ALL of it. Obviously, I'm not in the inner circle either Mr Kamensky. I blew the whistle on a massive, SEC facilitated fraud on the public that is very much ongoing. The SEC has KNOWINGLY used the SDNY courts to perpetuate this massive fraud prosecuting some while corruptly and criminally obstructing prosecution of KNOWN criminals. AND screwing those who blow the whistle and dare challenge: Dan Kamensky and Chris Dilorio.

Happy Friday!

ESWW was a money laundering shell.

The SEC knows it. The degenerate Epstein knows it. The Degenerate Leon Black/Kushner BFF/ Milken proteges/Marc Rowan/Apollo knows it.

The DOJ/IRS knows it.

IG, I have repeatedly offered to come to SEC DC HQ to have the brightest minds at the SEC totally humiliate me by refuting my allegations 1 by 1. The grossly corrupt SEC scumbags have never taken me up on my generous offer. For the very simple reason that ALL of my allegations are accurate and true.

So, I again put the offer out there:

refute my claims OR go to jail for the criminal obstruction ACTIVELY being facilitated by your office and the SEC. So, let's give these scumbags the insurance/annuities market.

This will NOT end well for tens of thousands of Americans.

Who "green lighted" this take over of the insurance industry by PE/Hedge funds?

IG,

This was a blatant attempt to intimidate a whistleblower. "HE" (I think a male although very effeminate voice) was an anonymous, coward, scumbag who threatened me. AND then called me another 11/12 times after that. This is a VERY serious matter. Felony. I intend to see "him" prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Within weeks of filing a complaint against the SEC and you.

I obviously have hit a nerve.

See my comment letters on this subject.

The SEC INTENTIONALLY puts the investing public at risk of frauds like this and thousands others like it. The core biz at NITE/VIRT,CDEL etc and the reason WHY the OTCM exists: Abusive naked shorting publicly traded shells to facilitate money laundering.

Shells go dark only AFTER a massive fraud has been perpetrated on the investing public: Main Street ANOTHER "genius" degenerate: Apollo
