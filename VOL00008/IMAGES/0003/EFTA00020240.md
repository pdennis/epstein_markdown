☐ could you please take on this project of making sure the victim info in the database is accurate for the letter that will go out? I can't tell if this email is just meant to supplement the data we already have, or if they're sending this as the proposed list (which would be strange, since it has our statutory victims on it). Thanks.

Good Evening,

SA _______________ has identified each of these names on the attached spreadsheet as victims in the original case against Jeffrey Epstein. Included in the attached document is victim contact information as well as attorney information regarding representation and contact information. This is a comprehensive list.

Lastly, would you be able to send your draft language for the VNS notifications?

Thank you,

Program Manager
FBI Victim Services Division
