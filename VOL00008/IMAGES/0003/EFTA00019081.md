Counsel,

Please see the attached letter regarding the superseding indictment that was returned by a grand jury sitting in Manhattan earlier today in the above-referenced case. Our team is available tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm to discuss the discovery issues you raised earlier, as well as whether supplemental briefing on your pretrial motions would be appropriate in light of the new charges, and any other issues you would like to discuss. Please let us know if you are available during those windows.

Best,
