Hey guys,

CNN is pursuing a story about how [Redacted] and [Redacted] came to our Office in 2015/2016 to raise questions about the Epstein plea deal in Florida. Apparently through (with?) their attorney, they talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. The reporter believes that it was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it went nowhere.

CNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information, so if they feel their competition will go with the story, they will, too.

Any guidance or thoughts are welcome.
