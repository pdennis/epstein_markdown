I just addressed it to [REDACTED] – if this looks okay to you, once [REDACTED] reviews it we can email the letter to [REDACTED] and ask her how she’d like us to get the laptop to MDC.

I don’t know the new Warden’s name. I think it’s fine to just address it to “Warden, Metropolitan Correctional Center”. Thanks!

What is the warden’s name? I can draft the letter we discussed.

The Maxwell Laptop is ready to be picked up in room 307. We removed all the laptops electronic communication, so it has no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Ethernet connection capabilities. We tested access to the production data with the backup BOP production and works fine. We placed a sticker on the laptop with the password.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much, [REDACTED]. Is the laptop large enough to save any of Maxwell’s discovery on it? Or would doing so just slow it down? I ask because her attorneys requested that we load her discovery onto the laptop if possible.
