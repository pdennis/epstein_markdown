If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to do so.

The defendant also made oral statements when he was arrested on or about July 6, 2019. Notes memorializing those statements are included in this production and are marked with control number USAO_002273.

The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information constitutes Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. Specifically, the Government discloses the following:

- The victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-1" received a grand jury subpoena from the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 was never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") or SDFL in connection with their investigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was first interviewed by law enforcement regarding Jeffrey Epstein in or about 2019, after FBI agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-1. The victims identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" and "Victim-3" we both interviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation in or around 2007. Please note that all three of these victims are currently represented by counsel.

- During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" stated that during her first contact with the defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she was younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law enforcement that the first time she met Epstein, she told him that she was 16, when in fact she was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other victims to the defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these victims that they should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. Over time, however, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to understand that the defendant had a specific preference for underage girls.

- During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness ("Witness-1") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls for sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: "the younger the better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." Witness-1 is represented by Rita Glavin, Esq.

Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court.

## Disclosure by the Defendant

In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant’s possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant’s possession or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial.

The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

## Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility

This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to the Government’s initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court six weeks in advance of the trial.

Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not constitute a “formal offer” or a “plea offer,” as those terms are used in *Lafler v. Cooper*, 132 S. Ct. 1376 (2012); *Missouri v. Frye*, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012).

Very truly yours,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
