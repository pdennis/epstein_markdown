Hi

We wanted to share the good news that we spoke with lawyer late this afternoon, and he told us that his client is on board with cooperating with our office's investigation and possible prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. Our next step will be to meet with for an interview to cover several topics that were previously off-limits during our meetings with her. We hope to have that meeting or the week thereafter, depending on her schedule.

Best,
