Can I give you a call tomorrow (or Monday) to discuss? Nothing comes to mind in terms of emails, and [REDACTED] was on Epstein was it first came in, if that's helpful.

Thanks, [REDACTED] Was looking for any emails she may have saved re Epstein.

I don't think that we have all of [REDACTED] trafficking emails, but she saved certain emails relevant to specific topics in the Coordinator shared drive. [REDACTED] was our predecessor though, so we didn't have a transition conversation with [REDACTED] (although I don't think [REDACTED] saved any emails either). Is there something specific we can help you look for?

Hi,
I hope you both are well! Do you happen to know if [REDACTED] saved her emails on the trafficking share drive? I have poked around and couldn't find them and [REDACTED] had suggested I check with you on the handoff (I thought you both stepped into the role when she left, but let me know if I'm wrong).
Thanks!
