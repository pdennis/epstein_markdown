Hi - I am a Victim Specialist in New York and am reaching out in hopes that you can assist or guide me in the right direction. As you may have seen we have an open case regarding Jeffrey Epstein for trafficking charges. There is an identified victim who lives in and she is asking for counseling assistance. How would I connect her to appropriate referrals? I have asked her where she lives and am waiting to hear back. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. I have copied the Case Agent if you have any questions.

Thanks in advance! And Happy Thanksgiving!
