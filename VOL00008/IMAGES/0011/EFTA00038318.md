Gloria,

We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing , who should be able to hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide with your new client's name as it appears on her ID, date of birth, email address, and phone number?

Thanks,

Assistant United States Attorney
