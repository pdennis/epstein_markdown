Hi ___________ - it was great speaking with you today! As discussed due to Florida Crime Victims Compensation not being available to victims where the crime was committed in Florida; the FBI Victim Services Division has approved to pay up to 12 counseling sessions for these individuals.

If you have a client that would like to utilize this assistance - please send us their name for approval prior to any therapy. We can not pay for sessions that were not approved prior. All requests must be approved by the Case Agent _______________. If they have not been confirmed a victim by the FBI prior; _______________ must confirm that they are a victim in this case.

After they are approved - we can connect with the requested therapist to coordinate payment.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Stay well-
