Subject: RE: tip to the Manhattan DA's office

Importance: Normal

I got a call last week from the Manhattan DA's office, conveying that they had received a brief tip on their voicemail system, without a name or phone number (and not traceable via phone number on their system), saying that a [redacted] and a non-disclosure agreement with an underage girl, and that Maxwell had facilitated the NDA. Passing this along pursuant to our practice.

thanks,

Assistant U.S. Attorney
