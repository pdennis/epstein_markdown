Thanks very much for checking. I'm dropping off an application for an NDO now, so it should come back from the court by Monday at the latest.

As you requested we checked for common or repeat IP addresses in the Maxwell cell phone pen trap with negative results. We did find some random IP addresses in the pen trap that come back to facebook.

This leads us to believe she either has a facebook page, or has been accessing facebook from her phone. We ran all of the phone numbers we've known to be associated with Maxwell through facebooks law enforcement portal and found two of them to be associated with facebook accounts. Through the portal we are not able to view the actual account but were able to see that there at least once existed an account that was connected to these phone numbers.

Would you be able to cut us a facebook subpoena for subscriber and recent login information associated with the following phone numbers.
