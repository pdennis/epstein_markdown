Sorry about the delay this week. I have had trouble coordinating with one of the girls. Can we pick a day next week? Whatever works for you.

Hey [Redacted],

No problem and no rush. Early next week is great. They are both on standby and with a day or so notice can make anytime work.

Hey [Redacted],

I apologize but I'm pretty swamped this week. Are your clients able to talk early next week?

Hey [Redacted],

Just circling back on this. Are you available any day next week to speak with [Redacted] and [Redacted]?

Also wanted to check in on the possibility of obtaining 302's or another form of verification that a victim has interviewed with you.

Have a great weekend,
