I'll have those files you were having trouble with re-exported. And I'll be able to give you the last device tomorrow. See below on updated numbers. Let me know if you have questions.

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - RE: Confirmation of devices and responsive files

In addition to the information requested below, I have questions regarding a few particular files that I was unable to open on the drive of responsive materials from the FBI (I received an error message saying that the file was either too large, damaged, or corrupted to view). There were six files in total that I was unable to open, listed below with the device they were on.

NYC024326 → f_003a1d, f_003a1f, f_0039eb, f_00394b, f_003994
NYC024355 → 2b2cf6a7acb1a26fa73bc8d0e28a25119968507e

Please let us know at your earliest convenience about these files as well as my questions in my email yesterday (i.e., the number of highly confidential files and how we can get the responsive materials from the remaining devices that the FBI was assigned to review-- NYC024334, NYC027908, NYC024394, NYC024363).

Thanks so much,

Subject: Confirmation of devices and responsive files

Hope you're well and had a nice weekend! I am writing to confirm which devices had responsive materials (and how many responsive materials were on each device) for the Maxwell photo/video responsiveness review.

The drive which you gave me on Friday contains five folders, one for each of the following devices (NYC024323, NYC024326, NYC024355, NYC024368, NYC027910), each of which contains confidential material. Can you please let us know how many highly confidential images and video files were identified for these devices?

Additionally, can you please let us know whether the following devices (NYC024334, NYC027908, NYC024394) had any responsive material on them or not? These are devices that were initially assigned to the FBI to review but were not included on the hard drive given to us on Friday. If these devices do have responsive confidential material on them, we need to get that material from you ASAP, please.

Finally, the device highlighted below (NYC024363) is the one we spoke about last week which you said would not be ready on Friday to provide us with the responsive materials. Please let us know when this is done and how we can best get

EFTA00038202

these materials from you.

In sum, we need you to please confirm the contents of all of the cells below marked with an "x" at your earliest convenience. Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
