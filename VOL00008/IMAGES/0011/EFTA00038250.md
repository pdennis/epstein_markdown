Good Morning SSA [REDACTED].

The attached processed document is responsive to an ongoing FOIA litigation on subject Jeffrey Epstein. We have reviewed and processed for release. The upcoming release date is next Monday. The file this document was pulled from is a closed file, but we wanted to double check that if released, this document would not impact any ongoing investigations, that you are aware of.

Thank you,
