The Government hereby requests that you voluntarily refrain from disclosing the existence of the subpoena to any third party. While you are under no obligation to comply with our request, we are requesting you not to make any disclosure in order to preserve the confidentiality of the investigation and because disclosure of the existence of this investigation might interfere with and impede the investigation.

# Advice of Rights

1. You may refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question would tend to incriminate you.

2. Anything that you do say may be used against you by the grand jury or in a subsequent legal proceeding.

3. If you have a lawyer, the grand jury will permit you a reasonable opportunity to step outside the grand jury room to consult with your lawyer if you so desire.

4. If you would like a lawyer but do not have funds to retain one, you may make an application to the United States Magistrate Judge who will decide whether to appoint a lawyer to represent you.
