[REDACTED] thanks for sending this. [REDACTED] was represented by Gloria Allred who was provided all victim resource information. Allred made it difficult speaking with individuals she represented as we could not speak with them without her. Even with that block, resources and information were provided to her. [REDACTED] is welcome to reach out to us if she is looking for additional services, so you're welcome to pass along that information. I don't have her current contact information as she refused to provide it and all correspondence went through Allred.

Thanks,
