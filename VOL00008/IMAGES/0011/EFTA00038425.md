Hi Brittany - it was great speaking with you! As discussed here is the contact for the Crime Victims Treatment Center - ___________. Chris Bronson is the Executive Director that you met. Veronica answers the phone and makes appointments. Please let the girls know to use my name as a reference if they speak to Veronica.

The New York Crime Victims Compensation link is www.ovs.ny.gov. please have them complete an application and send to me. I will forward directly with the FBI paperwork.

For the individuals in Florida - please have their identified therapist contact me and we will request for the 6 sessions to be covered through our emergency victim assistance funds.

And lastly regarding the individual located in India. If you can get me her address and contact information; I will coordinate with our colleagues at the embassy there.

Please call me if you have any additional questions

Remind me of the name of the Center near Wall Street. I think that would be perfect for ___________ and ___________.

Finally - ___________ is currently living in India. Is there anything that can be done to help her? Would she still be eligible to receive 6 free sessions over there? Are there any resources that can be offered in India?

Let me know when you have a few minutes to talk.
