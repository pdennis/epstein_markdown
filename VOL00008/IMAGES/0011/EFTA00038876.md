Subject: FW: FOIA requests that seek historical flight data for Jeffrey Epstein aircraft

Good Afternoon SA

I'm a Unit Chief within the FOIA program and handle program coordination with other government agencies. We received the below forwarded email from FAA detailing FAA flight records that were inadvertently released as part of a FAA FOIA production. Prior to FAA's inadvertent release, FAA had been withholding all Epstein flight data per our request. We wanted to make you aware of the situation as you are listed as case agent in the 50D investigation. Please advise if I can do anything to assist.

Thanks,

Unit Chief/FOU-4
Information Management Division

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - FOIA requests that seek historical flight data for Jeffrey Epstein aircraft

Importance: High

The FAA has previously received FOIA requests seeking historical flight data for aircraft owned or operated by Jeffrey Epstein, specifically N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE and these are FOIA requests for which we have consulted with the FBI. One of those requesters, Angela Wang from Business Insider, submitted two requests in 2020 that sought the flight records for those four aircraft from January 1, 1990 to July 6, 2019. Both times, she was denied those records under exemption 7A because of the FBI's criminal investigation. Ms. Wang recently published an article (see link below) in which she references another FOIA request which sought all aircraft flights that are stored in the FAA Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) repository, which is where the FAA stores historical flight data. The records that were released in response to that FOIA request inadvertently included flights involving N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE. We have implemented measures to keep flight data from being released for N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE in response to future FOIA requests that seek the entire TFMS repository.
