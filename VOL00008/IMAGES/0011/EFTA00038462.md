Good morning [Redacted] I have a client who is a Florida victim and she is interested in trying to obtain FBI assistance with her therapy expenses. She has started sessions and the counselor has agreed to wait for payment. Her name is [Redacted]. Please let me know how we need to proceed. She currently resides in Ohio and I can assist in coordinating a time for her statement.

Thank you!
Maria K
