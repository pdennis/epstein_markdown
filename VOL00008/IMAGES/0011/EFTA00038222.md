Good morning,

To follow up an provide a bit more context for you:

Our Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) includes an investigative group who reviews news articles that might mention activity with a Western Union touch. I believe that is what happened in this case – our news sweeps team picked up information from an open source article, completed an investigation, and are in the process of filing a regulatory report. Once filed, I would like to proactively share the report to law enforcement for review. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jen

Jennifer,

Can you further identify what if information might refer to, response to a subpoena, or something else. What the information relates to will direct best POC here in NYO.

Thanks

Jen,

I have copied SA Wikstrom, the private sector coordinator in our NY Field Office. He should be able to provide you guidance on who to get that report to in NY.

Hey

I am hoping you can help me with a contact for FBI NYC? I am looking for a good contact to get a report over to him/her related to the Epstein investigation. We are not quite finished on our end, but I would like to have a contact lined up when we are.

Thanks!

Hi [REDACTED]

I hope all is well with you and that you’ve had a great summer!

I wanted to let you know that I was in Chicago last week where I participated in an IPR conference. One of the attendees is a newly assigned agent to the Denver office – John M (forget the rest of his last name). Anywho, it sounds like he will be working IP cases and was interested in any private sector companies who might be able to bring him some business. I threw out your name 😊

As always, please let me know if there’s ever anything I can do to help you!

Thanks,
Jen
