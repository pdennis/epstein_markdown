The following Epstein victims have been treating with therapist _______________________________ in West Palm Beach. I understand that some have exceeded the 6 sessions that are covered by the FBI, but that the FBI may be covering additional sessions. Do you have any info on that? Also, do you know if _______________________________ has been reimbursed for the sessions that she has conducted with each of these victims?

I know that you are crazy busy, so let me know how I can help on this, or if there is someone else in your office that you want me to reach out to.

As always, thank you so much for everything that you do.
