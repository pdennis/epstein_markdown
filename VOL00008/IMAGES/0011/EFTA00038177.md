Let me check with ☐; all financials were turned over to him. I’ll get back to you on this, hopefully by end of day today.

Hey ☐,

We’re working on getting discovery out for Maxwell and have run into a bit of a snag with the Amex returns. Some of them contain vsf files which we cannot unencrypted without a password of some sort. I believe that the returns from 1/24/20 came to you; do you have a record of the password or even a version of the documents that is unencrypted?

Thanks,

☐
