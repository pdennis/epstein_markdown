Sigrid- due to the nature of the discussion there will not be a zoom option. My understanding is they will send out the information after.

One of my clients who is overseas asked if she could participate by Zoom or some other on-line method. Will that be available as an option due to overseas travel restrictions?

Best,

Hello

I received it and will let my clients know about the meeting. Thank you. I am sure they are going to have a lot of questions. Am I correct in my understanding that this meeting is intended to go over what occurred during the earlier 2006 investigation?

Thank you for the notification and I hope you and  are both doing great.
Best,
