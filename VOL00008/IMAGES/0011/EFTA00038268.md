Assistant Director and General Counsel
Office of General Counsel
FBI Headquarters
Washington, D.C.

Mr. * -

Attached is a letter from Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Director transmitting to you, for a sensitivity review, OPR's draft report in the Southern District of Florida's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein matter during 2006-2008. We've found that the draft report is too large to email, so will set it separately in two parts. We ask that it be treated with confidentiality. The letter is self-explanatory, but please do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.

With regards,

Counsel
Office of Professional Responsibility
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. – Room 3266
Washington, D.C. 20530
