Team,

Just so everyone is in the loop, I got a call from David Rodgers’ attorney (in response to our email requesting an interview). Rodgers wants to be cooperative and will come in for an interview, but he is currently on a cruise, and his lawyers will need to talk to/meet with him after he gets back. They think late January/early February is a good timeframe to aim for.

We discussed logistics (because his attorneys are here in NYC), and they want us to fly him up, which shouldn’t be a problem.

We’ll check in with his attorney in a week or so and let you know.
