6. Brief Synopsis of Case :
In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his hands and/or sex toys. Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages."

On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. An arrest warrant has been issued out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York will be sworn out the day of arrest.
