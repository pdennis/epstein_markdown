Hope all is well. Just checking in to see how next week is looking and if you are going to be available for the 24th. No pressure if you're not able to swing it for that date, just wanted to check in.

Thanks,

Hello ☐,

Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what everyone's availability is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that you prefer to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

Thanks again,
