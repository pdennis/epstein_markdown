Hey _________,

Thanks so much for helping us out with this evidence. Hopefully it wasn't too annoying for you guys. Can you please send the boots back to us? The AUSA's are requesting that you guys send the evidence back so they can mark the exhibits.

Let me know if there is anything I need to do on my end. Much appreciated.

I've squared it away with our evidence. They assigned the lead to someone who is on vacation. They should have it shipped out by tomorrow sorry about that.

I got the thumb drive.
What is the case number?
I need it to check my ECR to see if we received the evidence.
