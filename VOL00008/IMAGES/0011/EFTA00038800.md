I'm sorry to hear you had to cancel tomorrow's interview. Is there any day in the next couple of days/weeks that work for you to reschedule? We are able to be available for most all of this week and next week if you want to let us know what day/days work best.

Thanks again,

Thanks for calling be back today. I've CC'd my partner in this investigation FBI Special Agent _______________________________________________________________. Looking at the calendar it looks like Tuesday January 5th is a good day to aim for. Lets try for 1PM. I will have the prosecutors send out a calendar invite shortly for that time and date, and if we need to change as we get closer please let us know.

Thanks you again,
