Hi ___________________________________________________________

Thanks for coordinating everything with Maxwell.

Is it okay if I bring the laptop back up to your desk today?

I don't think you need to wear a suit. I would talk to ___________. She's helped us with this before. But casual wear should be fine

Hi ___________________________________________________________

Just wondering, what is the dress code for the meeting? Suite and tie I presume?

Thanks!

Hey ___________________________________________________________ and ___________________________________________________________.

I am out of the office today but I wanted to connect you with our analyst on this case. ___________________________________________________________ will have the discovery laptop and hard drive so please coordinate with her to get it for tomorrow.

Tomorrow the defense has asked to review from 10am-3p. I will also cc you on an email to the AUSA.
