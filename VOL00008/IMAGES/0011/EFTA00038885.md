Hi _______________ and _______________,

I hope that you are doing well. ☐ is speaking with an immigration lawyer and wants to go forward with the T visa application. I will give you more information about the status of that as I get more info from the immigration lawyer. Also, ☐ filed a claim w the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund. She had her interview w the fund managers yesterday. I believe it went well. I am not sure how the process works but just wanted to give you a heads up in case they contact you for confirmation or information regarding her victimization.

I also wanted to thank both of you again for all of your kindness toward ☐.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Very truly yours,
Erica

Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas approved each year and the timeframe.

I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

Hi Erica – hope you are doing well too! I believe you said that your office has an Immigration attorney who will assist her; is that still the case or do you need Immigration referrals? I know we discussed both options previously the last time the three of us spoke; but wanted to see if you have any additional questions and would like to talk again?

Let me know what works best
