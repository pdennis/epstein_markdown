① I sent Lucian &amp; Rushia's mail to their correct address and called Post office to make sure all future mail will be sent to them.

② I scheduled the cable company to come on Thursday. This is their soonest appointment. Ghislaine asked me to make an appointment because the TV in the 'Blue Room' does not get a clear reception.

③ Shutter company will come early Thursday to measure shutter next to Ghislaine's desk. The shutter will not roll down.

* Both cable company &amp; shutter company will call me on my cell phone to make sure Jeffrey &amp; Ghislaine are not here.
