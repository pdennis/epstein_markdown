Hey

I'm reattaching the master list I compiled along with all of the source documents for RIDS. While I was going through all of the names, I saw that there were different versions of names on the different documents. For the ETS list, RIDS or someone down there in Virginia should go through the lists slowly to make sure we are searching for all permutations of victims names so nothing accidentally gets left un-readacted.
