Hello all,

As an FYI, the Merson Law claimants, who have been sending us admin claims every other day, have filed suit in the District of D.C. I am not sure if you were tracking the SDNY lawsuit, but the Plaintiffs' voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit last month after the court denied their motions to proceed anonymously.

I will keep you updated.

Thanks,

Assistant General Counsel
