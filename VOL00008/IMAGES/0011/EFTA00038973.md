Great!

I'm around Thursday to chat. You can call me at my cell anytime. We can discuss options. Ideally I'd prefer the originals.

Are any of these 4 attached sketches ones you drew?

Thanks!

Hi [redacted],
Yes, that was my work.
Are you seeking prints or originals?
I'm at the Sarah Palin trial tomorrow but should be available on Thursday if you'd like to discuss further.
Thanks!

Hello,

I’m looking to track down who did sketches of myself and my partner [redacted] during the Maxwell trial. She was called to testify for the defense when sketched and I was sketched while setting up the massage table. We are looking to purchase some of these sketches. Please let me know if that was you or you can assist me in my search.

Thanks!
