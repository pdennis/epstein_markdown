Hi _______________________________

That's not a problem at all! I'm glad that they would like to meet with us. We would be happy to sit down with them. We've already set aside those days in case we had people who wanted to talk with us.

It would also be great to set up a time to discuss with you just a little bit of their background prior to going in to meet with them. Thanks!

All four will be present at the victim briefing in New York on October 23. Would it be possible to schedule meetings with you later that day (October 23) or the following day (October 24)? If you want or need any information on these victims in the meantime, we are happy to set up a time to discuss.

Hope you are doing well,
