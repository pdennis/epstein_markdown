Squad C-20 is requesting the assistance of two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to help out on Friday 11/13 from 9:00 am - 3:00 pm. You would have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would be shown to them.

If you are able to assist, please reach out to SA [redacted] (she is cc'd)
