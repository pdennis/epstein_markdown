## Who can apply for compensation?

Innocent victims of crime, certain relatives, dependents, legal guardians and eligible Good Samaritans can apply to the Office of Victim Services (OVS) for compensation of out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance or other resources.

## What kind of expenses can I get compensated for?

OVS offers compensation related to personal injury, death and loss of essential personal property.

The specific expenses OVS may cover include:

- Medical, pharmacy and counseling expenses
- Loss of Essential Personal Property (up to $500, including $100 for cash)
- Burial or Funeral Expenses (up to $6,000)
- Lost Wages or Lost Support (up to $30,000) (Parents or guardians of hospitalized minor children may be eligible for this benefit.)
- Transportation (court/medical)
- Occupational/Vocational Rehabilitation
- Security Devices and DV Shelter Costs
- Crime scene clean-up (up to $2,500)
- Good Samaritan property losses (up to $5,000)
- Moving expenses (up to $2,500)

## How do I ask for compensation?

Send us your completed OVS application along with copies of:

- Police reports
- Medical bills
- Correspondence with insurance companies or benefits plan saying if they will cover your loss
- Insurance cards
- Receipts for essential personal property
- Death certificate and funeral contract
- Victim's birth certificate
- Proof of age (driver's license, birth certificate etc.)
- Legal guardianship papers

## What if I don't have some of the papers OVS needs?

Send your application in right away. You can send the other documents later.

## What if my property was lost, damaged or destroyed because of the crime?

If you are under 18, 60 or over, disabled or were injured, you may apply for benefits to replace your essential personal property or cash that was not covered by any other resource.

Essential means necessary for your health and welfare, like eyeglasses and clothes.

## What if I move?

Send OVS a signed letter right away. Tell us your new address and phone number. Also let us know if your email address changes.

## Who can sign the claim?

Generally, the victim must sign the claim. However, if the victim is under 18, or is physically or mentally incapable of signing, then the legal guardian (the person receiving the benefits) must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign the claim.

If the victim died, the person asking for benefits must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign the claim.

## Is there another way to apply?

Yes. Visit ovs.ny.gov to access the secure Victim Service Portal (VSP) and file an application on line.

# Court Ordered Restitution Information

## What is restitution?

Restitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a result of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence.

Restitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or "pain and suffering."

When the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact statement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the victim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does not order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record.

## What can I request as restitution?

You can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense – even for items the OVS may not be able to reimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of earnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property.

## Who is entitled to restitution?

Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek restitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that they are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve.

## How do I ask for restitution?

You should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you are requesting.

It is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and other documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want considered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report). Be sure to:

- Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense.
- Give copies of these receipts to the police, DA and local probation department.

You need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the probation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided before the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court.

The DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf.

In all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision (PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you about the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case.

## How is restitution determined?

The amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The perpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the Court may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution hearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to your case.

If the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is important that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS.

If you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution.
