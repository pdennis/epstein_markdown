Hi [redacted]:

I am fairly certain Monday afternoon will work unless there is a change with [redacted]. Do you have a specific time in mind?

Hope all is well. Just checking in to see how next week is looking and if you are going to be available for the 24th. No pressure if you're not able to swing it for that date, just wanted to check in.

Thanks,

Hello [Redacted],
At this time I have the 24th available. However, [Redacted] starts radiation next Wednesday and I will not have the upcoming schedule until then. I will stay in touch.
Best,

Hello [Redacted],
Hope you are feeling well. How does the afternoon of Monday 8/24 work for you for a video conference? I've spoken with our team and that seems to be the best date for us right now. If that doesn't work please let us know any other dates that may be better for you.

Thanks again,

Hello [Redacted],
Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what everyone's availability is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that you prefer to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

Thanks again,
