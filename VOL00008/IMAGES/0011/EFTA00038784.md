Hi ,

Doesn't look like the 26th will work - still having a lot of family issues. Having access to a computer/video in a private area is also an issue. It might be better to wait until I can meet with you all in person. Hopefully, the vaccine will be widely available soon.

Stay safe and healthy,

Hi ,

So sorry to hear about your cousin. This interview can certainly wait until the last week of January. Take this time to be with her and enjoy your vacation.

Let's schedule a date for that week and I'll send out a calendar invite. How's Tuesday the 26th in the afternoon work for you? Feel free to throw out another day or time if that's no good. As of now we are mostly available that week.

Hi ,

I'm on vacation with my husband now, and think in the next couple of weeks it will be a problem because my first cousin (who is like a sister) is in hospice. So sad as she is so young.

The last week of January should be fine. Do you have time then?

Thanks,

I'm sorry to hear you had to cancel tomorrow's interview. Is there any day in the next couple of days/weeks that work for you to reschedule? We are able to be available for most all of this week and next week if you want to let us know what day/days work best.

Thanks again,
