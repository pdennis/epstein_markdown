Thanks, [REDACTED], Are you able to create an excel spreadsheet for this evidence, similar to the ones you created for the NY/FL evidence? Thanks!

Hi [REDACTED].

Thanks so much for coordinating the 72 case evidence—really great that we’ve got it in New York now. Could you please send us an index of the items that we can produce to the defense? I think we’re hoping to produce something similar to what we produced the last time.

Thanks,
