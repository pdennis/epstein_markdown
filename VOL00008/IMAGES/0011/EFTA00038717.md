Hi [REDACTED]

One more for you: would you serve the attached subpoena or [REDACTED] and see when she's free for a call? Ms. [REDACTED] was the court reporter for [REDACTED] sworn statement, and we may need to call her to admit some of those statements. I've attached a copy of the statement, which hopefully will help track her down.

Thanks,
Andrew
