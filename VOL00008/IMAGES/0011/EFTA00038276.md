Dear Ms. Strauss:

By way of background [redacted] is a former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the Vietnam War.

Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison.

I am respectfully requesting as a former Assistant United States Attorney and a present practicing attorney that you utilize your good office to interview [redacted] who seeks to lend you assistance in this investigation. It is my respectful opinion that [redacted] possesses important and vital information that can assist in the interest of justice.
