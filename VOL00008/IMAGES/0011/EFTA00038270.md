Re: The Office of Professional Responsibility’s Draft Report of Investigation into the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of Its 2006–2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation

Dear Mr. [REDACTED]:

The Office of Professional Responsibility has been investigating allegations that prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida improperly resolved a federal criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement (NPA) in 2007, and into judicial criticism of the government for failing to consult with the victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was signed and by misleading them regarding the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.

OPR has completed its investigation and has drafted a report setting forth its findings and conclusions and the bases for them. Because of the congressional, victim, and public interest in the investigation, OPR plans to release its final report to Congress and expects that its report will be released to the public. Because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was the investigating agency and some of its work and special agents are mentioned in the report, OPR is providing you with its draft report for a sensitivity review.

Please advise OPR if you have objections to the public release of information contained in the draft report. Please note that the sourcing citations in the footnotes will be removed from the final report. Therefore, names that appear in those footnotes, but which are otherwise not identified in the text of the report, will not appear in the final report. FBI personnel are not identified by name in the text of the report.

OPR would appreciate receiving your comments by Monday, September 14, 2020. Because OPR’s draft report is confidential, please share it only with those members of your staff needed to evaluate the report’s impact, if any, on your office’s work. If you have any questions, please contact me at

Sincerely,
