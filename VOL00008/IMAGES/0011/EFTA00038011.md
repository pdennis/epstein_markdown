I don't know if you were on the initial appearance call, but Maxwell consented to remand and she's pending transfer to NY.

Thank you and your team for all your help over the past couple days. I know it was a long couple days. Please feel free to pass along our thanks to everyone on your team that helped with this operation. We are grateful for all the coordination and assistance you provided.

Thanks again,
