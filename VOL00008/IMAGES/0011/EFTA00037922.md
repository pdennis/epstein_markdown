Hey

No problem and no rush. Early next week is great. They are both on standby and with a day or so notice can make anytime work.

Hey

I apologize but I'm pretty swamped this week. Are your clients able to talk early next week?

Hey

Just circling back on this. Are you available any day next week to speak with

Also wanted to check in on the possibility of obtaining 302's or another form of verification that a victim has interviewed with you.

Have a great weekend,

Hi

I apologize for the delay in response but I wanted to check on scheduling. As of right now, I'm not going to be available on Monday. Is there another day that would be possible?

Thanks,
