Hi _______________________________.

Thanks for the email. If we need to ask you to testify, it will need to be in person, but we don't yet know whether that will be necessary. We'll get back to you with more information as soon as we can.

If you have more questions, please reach out to Special Agent _______________________________, and we'll get back to you.

Thanks.

I'm writing re the summons to appear in this case. Do I need to appear or can it be a zoom deposition?
