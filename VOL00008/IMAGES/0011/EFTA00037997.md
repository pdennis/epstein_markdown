Sorry about the delay this week. I have had trouble coordinating with one of the girls. Can we pick a day next week? Whatever works for you.

Hey

I apologize but I'm pretty swamped this week. Are your clients able to talk early next week?

Also wanted to check in on the possibility of obtaining 302's or another form of verification that a victim has interviewed with you.

Have a great weekend,
