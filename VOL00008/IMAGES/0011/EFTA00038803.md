Jill I'm glad that you noted that as the AUSA's sent you two emails this week that we weren't sure or not if you had received. Must be some issue with the governments servers. Either way no worries, when are you available for a phone call this week? I can just email with you directly if this thread is the technical issue.

Jill,

Thank you for reaching out to me about your client and we appreciate your assistance in the matter. I've CC'd some of the members of our team including the prosecutors from the Southern District of New York. We agree that a call may be a good idea to hash out some of these details and questions you may have. Is there a particular time that works for you?

Dear [redacted]

My client has been in contact regarding the possibility of an interview to take place in London. Please note that my client is entitled to automatic anonymity under UK Statute as herself a victim of sexual assault that occurred in the UK and she does not waive her right to that anonymity.

I very much look forward to hearing from you in order that we may set up a convenient time for you to meet with my client but perhaps before that it would be useful if you could confirm the parameters of your interest in my client.

A call may be a good idea.

Kind Regards

Jill
