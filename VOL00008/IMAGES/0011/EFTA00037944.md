Hi

I'm writing to request travel approval to arrest a target in the Epstein investigation; we believe her to be in Massachusetts. and I, along with our two supervisors would be going up tomorrow and returning the following day. We will be driving up, and possibly escorting the target back to NY. Estimated expenses are below.

Hotel: $161 per night ($644)

Per diem: $91.5 ($366)

Parking: $50

Total for 4: $1060
