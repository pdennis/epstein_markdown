I definitely understand that. That would work. Thanks for canvassing.

Hi

Since it might be tough for agents to assist for three days, I can send this out to see if anyone can give a day for it if that works for you guys? You might get two different people helping each day.

Let me know and I can resend the request.

Hey Tracy,

Could you canvas for at least two agents, possibly three to assist with Maxwell and her defense team reviewing evidence at 500 Pearl Street from Tuesday April 13 through Thursday April 15. This will be from 9:00am and continue for the entire day for all three days. AUSA [redacted] will be present as well for the review. Please see below for additional info.

- Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 5th floor of the 500 Pearl Street courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13, 2021 and will continue every day thereafter until the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows:

- The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense counsel are expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. We will need at least one FBI agent with a handcuff key who is responsible for pulling Maxwell from the Marshal cellblock and monitoring her (the same way an agent would monitor any proffering inmate at 500 Pearl) throughout the day. Please note that an agent will likely need to escort Maxwell to the bathroom during the day as well.

- AUSA [redacted] has reserved three proffer rooms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the evidence for review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence items, to confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or AUSAs who are not currently monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell.

Thanks!
