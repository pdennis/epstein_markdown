I'm just trying to get subscriber records. They sent me phone records but didn't send me subscriber info. I followed up to the general email but haven't heard back. Attached is the subpoena.

Do you have a law enforcement contact or know someone at AT&amp;T? I'm trying to get some records quickly and just seeing if there is someone I could speak to direct. If not, no worries.
