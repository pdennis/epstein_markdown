I have this sheet that I gave to [Redacted], maybe this helps? It's tough to help as I don't have access to look at the items till tomorrow AM. Just remember, some items had multiple hard drives in them, so some items might map back to the same 1B.

Hey [Redacted],

I attached the sheet that [Redacted] went over with you with CART numbers. I can't match up all the numbers with 1B numbers—some of the cart numbers for the island I don't even have so I'm not sure where the mix up is. Are you able to identify what items these are? Any info would be helpful.

Thanks,
