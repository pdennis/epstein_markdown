Hi [redacted].

Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to want to do this interview in the safest possible way.

Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming time sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to speak with us. In lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date we are still ok with you blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference sometime in near future.

Please see attached to the subpoena your Advice of Rights.

Thanks again,

EFTA00038801
