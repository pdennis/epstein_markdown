I have a phone number for but she wanted no further contact regarding this case the last we spoke. Let me know if you'd like the number.

Hello again,

This is to confirm that the invitation was sent via email this afternoon to 14 attorneys, with requests to pass on to their clients; 6 victims; and a family member of one of the deceased victims. I've added a column "Invite sent for Nov 12 meeting."

The victims for whom column G ("Contact information") is red-highlighted have not yet received an invitation via email, either directly or through a request to their attorneys to pass it on. If you have any additional thoughts on how to reach those individuals for whom no phone number or mailing address is listed, we would appreciate your advice.

Hi

Thank you very, very much! I am not sure if the invitations have gone out but [REDACTED] can confirm. For most survivors on the master list, we did not have direct email addresses. For many survivors, they also had multiple attorneys (i.e. different attorneys mentioned on different lists) so I was not sure who the most current was.

Thanks,

Hi

Here you are. When we send the invitations, we send the PDF (paper) and fillable. The PDF just makes it so nothing can modified. I also attached the working document - I removed the meta data so no one will know who saved it last or where the document is being stored, and you can use this at a template in the future.

Have a great week ahead,

Hi there,

Just FYI here is the latest clean versions of both documents that is sending through clearance.

Can I ask what you were proposing with re a more friendly "advisory" title for the COVID poster, which is currently titled "Temperature Screening in Progress for Visitors." I was not sure it needed changing but if so, can you clarify how you wanted it to read and do you have a word version for adjusting it?

I am not free tomorrow morning but can also be available after 2:30 PM.

Good Morning All,

Hope everyone is doing well. A few questions:

- , when you get a chance can you send over the clean copies you plan on sending out via email? Also, are we still on the timeline to send out the email today?
- When would be a good time for both of you to chat again this week? We’d like to start discussing what you’d DOJ would like in the individualized packets. Our hope is to create them here at FBI HQ and Fed-Ex to the Miami Field Office.
