Thanks for sending. For this account, could you please send us the account statements surrounding the 10/19/99 transfer to Maxwell that we discussed? It would be helpful to understand what the source is of the funds for the transfer. In addition, could you please let me know the bates range for the account documents for this account? I'm having difficulty locating them in the production. If you're able to flag any other KYC documents in the file, that would be extremely helpful.

Thanks,

Attached are the account documents for the Financial Trust Company. In the production, I did not see a signature card for these accounts. However, there is a J.P. Morgan Entity Resolution form which schedules authorized signers (bates # 1934).

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Best

Hi

EFTA00038690

When you have a moment, could you please send me the signature card for the JP Morgan account ending in 5001? It's the Financial Trust Co. account. I wasn't able to easily locate it in the production, so wanted to check with you.

Thanks!
