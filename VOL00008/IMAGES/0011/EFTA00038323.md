Hi ________________________________________________________________________

Hope all is well. Someone we work with who does a lot of intel-gathering on john review boards saw the following post on a review board called TNA. "Dollar Bill" is William Mersey. We prosecuted him for a felony promoting prostitution conspiracy; he had a federal case as well. Don't want to waste your time and this may be complete bs, but I didn't want to ignore it, and suggested that I forward it to you.

Best,

Hey [redacted],
We saw this post on TNA Board today - poster alleges to be Dollar Bill:

We all know his penchant for hyperbole, but initial details seem to check out - not sure where this intel should go.
