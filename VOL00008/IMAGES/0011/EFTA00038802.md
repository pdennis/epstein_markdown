Hi

I am now in your fair city. I can do the 5.30pm tomorrow as [redacted] wont be on the call.
I should mention that [redacted] has been a friend of mine and the [redacted] family for 25 years.
She said that if either you or [redacted] needed a character reference on me, she would be happy to give one. I spoke to her in LA just now.
Have a great rest of the weekend.

Regards
[redacted]

Hello [redacted],
I've spoken with the team they are going to available on Monday afternoon at 5:30 for a meeting with you. I know you had mentioned being in New York that day and meeting with us in person but as of now it will work best for our team to conduct a virtual interview. If you are comfortable with that we can schedule you for 5:30 PM on Monday 1/11. You would receive email instructions on how to log into the secure video line from either your cell phone or computer.

Please let me know and thanks again,
