Hi — I hope all is well. I am sure you are swamped with your case, so I don't want to take up too much of your time.

After we interviewed Larry Visoski in November for our case, we have been trying to coordinate with our HSI partners to interview our subject, in an effort to close the loop on our case. We have finally set a date and are traveling to South Carolina next week to interview him. (Our subject is a CBP employee who previously covered St. Thomas airport, and supposedly knew/socialized with Epstein).

Just in case, I wanted to check in with you to see if there was anything in particular that you would want me to ask our subject while we have him, if it helps you.

Best regards,

Special Agent
