Thank you,

I look forward to hearing from you about the dates and helping where if I can.

Is this something a lawyer is needed for? Sorry I have never had to do something like this. I saw the subpoena mentioned I could but wasn't sure if it was necessary or not.

Thanks

See attached subpoena. As per our conversation you DO NOT have to appear on that date listed on the subpoena as you agreed to speak with us over video conference. You can retain this though for your records. We will be on touch with some proposed times and dates.

Thanks again,
