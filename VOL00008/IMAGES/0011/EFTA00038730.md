We have a bit of a conflict in timing on our end that I did not initially realize for next Friday. I do apologize but is there any chance you can speak with us earlier that morning (around 10-11am New York time) instead of 2pm? Are you still living in Arizona? If this is too early we can also try and arrange some other timing during the week if you know your work schedule better by now. I don't expect our conversation to be much more than an hour.

Sorry again and please let me know,

&gt; Thanks,
