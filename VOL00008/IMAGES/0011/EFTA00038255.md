Hi [REDACTED] - I was just speaking to [REDACTED] about the meeting and funding came up. Do [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] need to request case funds or is another division paying for them? [REDACTED] also briefed the C20 A/SSA about the meeting - but is there something in writing she can give him so management has specific details?

Thanks [REDACTED]
