Hey ___________ -- in the spirit of closure (!), any luck on the concurrence form? I have ___________ from NYPD, so now that sentencing is done I think the office will submit as soon as possible (it's due Friday, but I think because of the upcoming holiday weekend they'd love to submit today or tomorrow). Thanks!

Dear ___________,

Been a while, so I hope you're well these days! I wanted to send a quick email because our office is nominating the Epstein / Maxwell case for a Director's Award in the category of Superior Performance by a Litigation Team. Doing a nomination for that award in particular allows the office to include law enforcement partners as well, so we're thrilled to have the full team in the application, including in recognition of your extensive efforts with victims. I've reached out to ___________ and ___________, and so also wanted to ask you if you could please either email, or give me a quick call to tell me, your:

- DOB

EFTA00038968

- Last four of SSN
- Your GS scale
- Whether you’ve won any DOJ or other professional awards in the past three years

That’s all! I’m reachable anytime at this email or by phone at [redacted]. If it’s possible to chat today, that would be great, or if not then whenever you’re able.

thanks again,

[redacted]

Assistant U.S. Attorney
