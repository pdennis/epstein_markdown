Good Morning SA . I am going to follow up this email with 4 attachments of an upcoming OPR report re: 2006-08 Epstein Investigation. OPR forwarded to us for review to make sure our 7A stance is not impacted.

I am going to begin to review this today, but I wanted to forward for you, as well. If you have not reviewed this yet, please let us know if anything within the report could impact any ongoing investigations.

We have until this Friday to respond.

Feel free to email or call with any questions.

Thanks,

Mr. [Redacted]

Attached is a letter from Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Director [Redacted], transmitting to you, for a sensitivity review, OPR's draft report in the Southern District of Florida's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein matter during 2006-2008. We've found that the draft report is too large to email, so will set it separately in two parts. We ask that it be treated with confidentiality. The letter is self-explanatory, but please do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.

With regards,
