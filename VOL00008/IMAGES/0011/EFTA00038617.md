# Epstein Investigation Summary &amp; Timeline

## FBI Miami investigation:

- In 2005, the West Palm Beach Police Department, and then FBI Miami, initiated an investigation of Epstein after parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein had sexually abused their daughter from 2002-2005.
- Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims, a search warrant executed on Epstein’s Florida (FL) residence, and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records.

## FBI New York investigation:

- On December 6, 2018, FBI NY initiated a case after Southern District of New York (SDNY) contacted FBI NY regarding several victims that had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein in the mid 2000’s.
- Beginning in at least 2002, Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Some of his victims were as young as 14.
- He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in Manhattan, New York and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
- Searches were executed at both locations and it bears noting that, contrary to some news reports, these searches did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms at Epstein’s residences.
- In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, Epstein worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein, both in New York and in Florida.

## Indictment of Epstein

- From January 2019 through June 2019 multiple victim witness interviews were conducted in New York and Florida
- The identified victims’ ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. In addition to the sex acts, victims would have to perform massages on Epstein nude or partially nude. Victims were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they went to Epstein’s residence.
