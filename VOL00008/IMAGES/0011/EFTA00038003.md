Hi

I received a call from the marshals this morning regarding the personal property that was transported with Maxwell, which includes her clothes, jewelry, credit card, and phone. We are releasing these items to defense counsel. However, Maxwell was also transported with security footage from the local jail where she was held, and the marshals would like someone to pick it up, because BOP will not keep it. Could you please pick this up from the marshals at 500 Pearl, and keep it in your files? If you have any questions, please feel free to call the marshal I spoke with

Thanks,
