Hi

I hope you're all well! I just added you to a "Maxwell Amazon Records" folder on USAfx, linked here:
https://usafx.box.com/s/xwzacvu1pqwl929zi5b0q91xkg9e0zh4

I uploaded two zip files – one entitled "Original Returns" and one entitled "SDNY_GM_00000966-976 (Amazon)". The original returns are the returns in their original format as we received them, and the SDNY folder contains the converted and Bates stamped versions of those original files. They are identical, but I uploaded them (a) for your reference and (b) because the Bates stamped versions are not password protected, making them easier to quickly review.

Thanks very much! If you have any issues, please let me know.

Hi

Could you please send [redacted] a copy of all of our Amazon returns in the Maxwell case? USAfx should be fine, thanks.
