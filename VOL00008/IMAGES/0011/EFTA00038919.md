Subject: [EXTERNAL] Maxwell

I have issued the following statement in response to multiple press inquires:

The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell is a welcome confirmation of the veracity of the charges brought against her on behalf of the very brave young women whom she directly participated in abusing. Speaking for the women I have been privileged to represent over the past decade, I thank the prosecutors of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for their unwavering dedication to achieving justice in this case, and I express my confidence in their continued dedication.

Satisfaction with Maxwell's conviction is tempered by the knowledge that other co-conspirators have yet to be held responsible for their involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's extraordinary criminal enterprise. Doors closed by Epstein's death may be opened by the very strong motivation Maxwell now has to unlock every door to which she holds a key.
