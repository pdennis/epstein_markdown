Great speaking with you today.

Attached is a copy of a KAO template. I know you have to rely on the USAO, but I would appreciate if you could have the letter by Thursday or Friday.

The SAR has not been filed yet. Once the SAR is filed you can request the back up by sending an email to Information Sharing team with USAA AMLI at [redacted] requesting the backup documentation for USAA case number, C2002421770 and DCN, (TBD; once the SAR is filed).

Sincerely,

AML FIU, Enterprise Risk and Compliance
