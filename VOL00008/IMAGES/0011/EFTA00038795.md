Hi

Sorry for the late reply and Hi

Happy to chat virtually next week. Would you mind if my attorney [redacted] listens in? Can we make the call earlier than 5.30pm which is a bit late in UK?

Very best regards

Hello [redacted],

I've spoken with the team they are going to available on Monday afternoon at 5:30 for a meeting with you. I know you had mentioned being in New York that day and meeting with us in person but as of now it will work best for our team to conduct a virtual interview. If you are comfortable with that we can schedule you for 5:30 PM on Monday 1/11. You would receive email instructions on how to log into the secure video line from either your cell phone or computer.

Please let me know and thanks again,
