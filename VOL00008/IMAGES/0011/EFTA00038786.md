Hello [redacted],

I've spoken with the team they are going to available on Monday afternoon at 5:30 for a meeting with you. I know you had mentioned being in New York that day and meeting with us in person but as of now it will work best for our team to conduct a virtual interview. If you are comfortable with that we can schedule you for 5:30 PM on Monday 1/11. You would receive email instructions on how to log into the secure video line from either your cell phone or computer.

Please let me know and thanks again,

Detective [redacted]
