Yes it’s the data we received from the carriers. I’ll take a look when we receive it from our evidence unit. I don’t really have control over the format, but I’ll take a look before sending over to you.

Thanks ___________________________________________________________ I think those were GPS data for Maxwell’s phone, is that right? If so, the blu-rays had the data in a format I’d never seen before, so not sure if there’s a different format you can use.

Hey ___________________________________________________________ and _________________________________________________________.

Just FYI, regarding those blu rays that were not working, we are having new copies pulled and made for you. It should take a day or two. I’ll let you know when they are complete.

Good morning, [redacted] and [redacted].

I hope you are both well! I'm following up on [redacted] message below. We are still having difficulty viewing the files on Blu-Ray discs 102, 103, and 104. I'd really appreciate it if you would be able to connect me with whomever prepared those Blu-Ray discs for us, so we can figure out the best way to access them.

Thank you very much for your help!

Got it, thanks very much for figuring that out! These came from [redacted] and [redacted] at the FBI, though there may be someone else at the FBI who handled the preparation of these files. I'm cc'ing [redacted] and [redacted] here.

/ , we are having issues with the files that you guys produced on the Blu-Ray discs labeled 102, 103, and 104. Would you mind connecting with whoever at FBI prepared those discs so we can figure out how to view them?

Thanks so much,

Hi

Just looping you in – thinks that these files can't really be opened. Instead, the name of each zip file seems to point to a specific location hit, and what's inside each zip file seems to be the metadata of that hit.

Do you happen to know the agent who provided these files? It might be best for us to reach out to them directly to confirm this, and possibly have them compile the data in a spreadsheet (or something like that) instead of thousands of individual zip files.

Thanks so much!

I've never heard of this type of file and the internet points to something about 5G cellular networks. These may be some type of system file in a cellular network and not meant to be opened. I'll have to research more.

Hi and

, , and I are having difficulty figuring out how to open these files below ( thinks they're GPS data for a cell phone). It looks like the files that should open are .3GPP1IRI files, but I'm not sure how to best view them. suggested Quick Time Plus, and while it did open the file, it showed only a single line of text. I'm not sure if that's the correct application for viewing GPS files such as these. Would you be able to point us to a specific app or converter we should use for this?

Thanks so much for your help! We really appreciate it.

Sorry for all the emails. I think I figured out what these are – I’m pretty sure they are GPS data for Maxwell’s cellphone. Would one of you please be able to figure that out? Once that’s confirmed, the Blu-Ray folders 102, 103, and 104 can all be moved into the TO BE PRODUCED folder for the Fifth Production. Thanks!

Correction, I was able to view the files in the folder entitled “Blu-Ray 105,” but I can’t figure out how to open the files in the other 3 folders. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!
