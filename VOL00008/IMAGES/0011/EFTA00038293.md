Subject: in the office?

Hi and

Detective [REDACTED] has a thumb drive of materials for us in the Maxwell case, and he can swing by the office today -- any chance you (or another paralegal) might be in the office and able to receive it from [REDACTED]? I'm copying [REDACTED] here to make this easier to coordinate.

Thanks!
