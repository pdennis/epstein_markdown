Good afternoon everyone,

I hope you and your families are all safe. I wanted to inform you that [redacted] requested a therapy appointment as a result of her victimization by Mr. Epstein. I wanted to get your approval for the 12 sessions prior to her appointment next week. I believe she had met and interviewed with the FBI already. If you need any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you so much for your assistance and support!
