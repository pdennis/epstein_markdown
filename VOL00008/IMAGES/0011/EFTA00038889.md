We need to discuss this.

☐ - I want to fill you in about the below. ☐ knew about this. We applied for CP by AUSA request which HQ denied because she is not a trafficking victim; which we discussed with the AUSA both prior to applying and after it was denied. . This is related to Jeffrey Epstein case.

Hi ☐ and _____________________________

I hope that you are both doing well. I am in the final (hopefully!) few days of COVID recovery. Thank goodness for vaccinations!

Sanctuary for Families is working with ☐ for a T-Visa application. In that regard, they have requested a letter/statement from your office regarding certain information.

Please let me know the best way of handling this (who to work with, best way to communication info, etc).

We really appreciate everything that you have done and your willingness to help ☐ finally move on with her life and heal.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Very truly yours,
Erica

Hi &lt;&gt; and &lt;&gt;

I just had a good call with &lt;&gt; and &lt;&gt;. I am so glad that this matter has come to an end and that they recently spoke with you about addressing &lt;&gt; immigration issue.

She has been conferring with an immigration lawyer. We still need a little time to get everything together. However, I just wanted to re-open the dialog with you guys and let you know we are still working on this.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks!
Erica

Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas approved each year and the timeframe.

I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

Hi Erica – hope you are doing well too! I believe you said that your office has an Immigration attorney who will assist her; is that still the case or do you need Immigration referrals? I know we discussed both options previously the last time the three of us spoke; but wanted to see if you have any additional questions and would like to talk again?

Let me know what works best-
