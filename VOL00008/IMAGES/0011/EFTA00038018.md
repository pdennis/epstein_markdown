Hey _________________,

I wanted to reach out about traveling internationally. ☐☐ and I, along with 2 AUSAs from SDNY were hoping to travel to __________ back in March to interview an important witness in the Epstein/Maxwell investigation, but due to Covid that was not possible. We spoke with her briefly today via video and she is not comfortable talking at length unless it is in person. What is the possibility of getting approval to travel within the next month or so? Separately, I understand we would also have to get IOD approval?

Happy to chat via phone too if you have time.

Thanks,
