Hi 📖 Here is the most recent copy of the index.

On another note, as you may have heard from the case team, my last day at SDNY will this Friday, as I’m leaving for another opportunity. 📖 will be the paralegal on the case from here on out, and I’m confident she will do an incredible job.

I wanted to say what an absolute privilege it has been to have worked with you and 📖 on this incredibly important case! Your hard work and unwavering dedication is inspiring, and it’s been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to watching you all carry this case forward in the coming weeks!

All the best,

Hey 📖

I know you guys are swamped, but would you mind sending over a copy of the exhibit list when you have a moment? Just so we have it for reference if you don’t mind.
