No problem,

I'll reach out to the team and see what days work for them. I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

Thanks,

Hi 🇨🇦.

I've thought about it, and I think I'd like to hear what the lawyers say before I agree to an interview, and for me to ask some questions etc.

I am available in the morning on Thursday at 6am TX time, or tomorrow morning at 11am TX time, or I can do a Wednesday morning time if those don't work?

Thanks!
