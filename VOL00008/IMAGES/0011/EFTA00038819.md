Good morning [REDACTED],

Things have calmed down a bit here and I have time to get back to you.

A couple of questions:

The email says we can have a video conference for a few hours. What type of video/computer capability would I need?

Would you rather I speak with Grand Jury in NYC? Do to Covid, I'd rather not come up.

Can I meet with the FBI in DC instead?

And, if it's possible to do a zoom meeting, I'll be at my computer tomorrow, Monday and Thursday morning. Please let me know ASAP as I have to arrange my schedule.

Thanks, [REDACTED]

Hi [REDACTED],

Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to want to do this interview in the safest possible way.

Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming time sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to speak with us. In lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date we are still ok with you blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference sometime in near future.

Please see attached to the subpoena your Advice of Rights.

Thanks again,

[REDACTED]
