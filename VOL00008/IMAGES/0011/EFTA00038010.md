Any time ☐ Honored to be able to assist in such an important case.

I am so happy for NYFO, NYPD, and the FBI overall. Good for all of you staying tenacious and ensuring MAXWELL was brought to justice.

Hit me up if you need anything in BS division or New Hampshire. Safe travels back.

Stay safe.

I don't know if you were on the initial appearance call, but Maxwell consented to remand and she's pending transfer to NY.
