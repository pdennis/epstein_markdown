Hey ,

Are you in the office today? I wanted to check in about the message pad scans; I know that they are rather large. I want to get them down drafted and on a disc or hard drive to get over to the AUSA's office before we proffer a witness next week.

Also, do you have an estimate of the entire size of all that you scanned so I have a better idea of what device SDNY will need to store everything?

Can you email me or give me a call when you have a chance.

Thanks,
