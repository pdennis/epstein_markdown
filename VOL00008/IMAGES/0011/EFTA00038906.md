Subject: [EXTERNAL] Attorney for Epstein Victim re

Dear Ms.

I am one of the attorneys for and met you in 2019.

Ms. and I were both away last week or I would have emailed you sooner.

It was brought to our attention that was called as a character witness for the defense last week. From our understanding, Ms. gave a shining picture of Ms. Maxwell, and claimed that she was only at Epstein’s residence once in the years she worked for him.

According to Ms. , however, from 2001-2002, when she was 14-15 years old, in addition to Ms. would call her on the phone to schedule the sexual encounters with Mr. Epstein and would give her explicit instructions to follow upon arrival. She would then see Ms. at the property after speaking to her on the phone. See

Attached is a screenshot of Ms. LinkedIn profile two days prior to our filing suit against her. It was taken down immediately upon our filing the lawsuit naming her.

Ms. dropped her lawsuit against Ms. , Ms. and Ms. Maxwell, only because it was a required condition of her settlement with the Epstein Estate.

I hope this information is useful.

Very truly yours,

Of Counsel
Lerner &amp; Lerner, P.C.
