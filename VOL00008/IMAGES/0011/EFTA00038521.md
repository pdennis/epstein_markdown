Hey guys,

We spoke with __________ briefly this morning about his review of the recent bail submission and he would like to set up a time to speak with you guys about it. We are all free to chat for about the next 2 hours if you would like to chat over phone or video conference. You guys are also welcome to come hop into a conference room at our office to discuss. If today doesn't work we can try and set something up for tomorrow or sometime Friday.
