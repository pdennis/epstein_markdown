Thanks ☐. Nah, let's hold off for right now. With no idea when we will have a grand jury, things are up in the air right now. I'll keep you posted when we are likely to go forward. Thanks for your help with this.

I told _____________________________ it was a detective who told me in passing, and this was before you contacted us. It's a small town, and when we ask the PD it will get around. Are you getting ready to arrest? If so, we can make contact with the PD.

Good morning,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and touch base about possible sightings of Ghislaine Maxwell in Manchester. I know we spoke earlier this year about it and I believe you had mentioned that a local PD had seen her around town. Our AUSAs are asking about those sightings and requesting more detailed info- where she was seen and how often/how many times and how recently that had been. Any information you could provide about that would be helpful.

Thank you,
