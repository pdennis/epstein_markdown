Case Name: USA v. Maxwell
Case Number: 1:20-cr-00330-AJN

Document Number: 657

Docket Text:
OPINION &amp; ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...[*** See this Opinion &amp; Order ***]... V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or

EFTA00038962

variance because the jury instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/29/2022)(bw)
