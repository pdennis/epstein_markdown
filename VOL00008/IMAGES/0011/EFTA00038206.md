Thanks [redacted], [redacted] told me he was not available for Friday, so if the other two would be available, that would be great.

Hi [redacted].

I sent it to [redacted] and [redacted] to see if they were available. I am aware that [redacted] is not available but I am not sure about [redacted] yet. I have two others I can send it to before I send it out to the whole group.

Hi [redacted].

Would you mind canvassing for C-20 assistance for Friday? Maxwell's defense is asking to review discovery materials at MDC on Friday. Same request as before where it would be from 8am-3pm. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials.

Thanks!

All-

Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to help out one day next week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday. They have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials. Please let me know if you are able to assist

Thanks,
