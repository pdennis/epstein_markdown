I emailed you earlier about [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], so you have already connected them with HQ and I believe sent the questionnaire. I just emailed you and copied [REDACTED], so you can send to her now as well. I will also send you an email connecting Pralaya momentarily.

Thank you!

We represent the following additional victims who are now ready to speak with you regarding their experiences with Jeffrey Epstein:

All four will be present at the victim briefing in New York on October 23. Would it be possible to schedule meetings with you later that day (October 23) or the following day (October 24)? If you want or need any information on these victims in the meantime, we are happy to set up a time to discuss.

Hope you are doing well,
