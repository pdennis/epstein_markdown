- her travel with us from our victim invite last year had her as . All of the attorneys are emailing me asking questions about the invite and RSVPs since they are familiar with me. Maybe it would help avoid any confusion if you send a follow up email copying me that they should reach out to that email address directly for all questions and RSVP's and can copy like how and did; that way I am not the middle man. What do you think?

Hi

Please note we have her listed as not as you had written below to Gloria – just trying to be careful about transcription to avoid confusion.

Also, you have said that you have her listed as on "your list" but so far as I know you never sent us a list with an , so can you confirm whether we are missing a list?

Thank you!

I think that ☐ is her stage name. I believe you have booked her travel previously to New York under her legal name, which is the other name, but rather than my guessing re the spelling of her legal name, I just want Diane to check.

I told them we met with you botj but our list has her as ☐ which is different that on your client list. If Diane can send tomorrow to reflect the same that would be great.

Thanks Gloria!

Gloria - I sent your comments to DOJ. They are talking to the Miami office to see if there are any secure options; and we are hoping to have more answers on Monday. I will let you know soon as I have more answers.

Have a great weekend!

Our client, [redacted], would like to attend the meeting in Miami, please. She would like to have her boyfriend, [redacted], join her for support. I will have [redacted] get in touch with you directly to make the travel arrangements, and/or you can connect her to the correct person to help her. In addition to giving [redacted] your email, is there a phone number I should give her as well?

Many thanks for your help.

Diane
