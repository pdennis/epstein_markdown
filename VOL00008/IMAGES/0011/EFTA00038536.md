Give me a call on this. I'm actually on my way to [REDACTED]. We have an fbi office there. But it's 7 hours from where I'm stationed. Would love to address if we can while I'm there.

[REDACTED] happy new year! I hope you are doing ok! I am reaching out regarding [REDACTED] who you assisted us with last year. She has resurfaced and is asking for a trauma focused therapist. I told her I would reach back out to you since I know you had given this information to her before.

We are hoping to try to interview her sooner than later and wanted to ask if you know of any office locations close to her in [REDACTED]? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again for all of your help! We really appreciate it!
