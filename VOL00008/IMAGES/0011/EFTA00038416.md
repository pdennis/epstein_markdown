Thanks _________! This should not have been rejected because it is an Epstein victim and the understanding was that the dates could be 10 years ago; an I incorrect about that? I will give them a call.

Thank you!

The above claim is closed- awarded, so our medical team has been working on her bills. If it is a different victim, let me know. I can look up that claim and let the Investigator know. Thanks!!

Hi [REDACTED] - I hope all of you are doing well during this! I know that OVS is also working from home as we are. One of the Epstein victims emailed me that OVS told her they left me a message needing information. Her claim number is [REDACTED]. I am not sure who to tell but if you wouldn't mind letting your colleagues know that I am at home and can be reached at this email or my cell [REDACTED] if they have questions for me.

I really appreciate all of your help!
Stay safe!

Hi [REDACTED],

We are all out of the office and the supervisors have the ability to work from home. I put her name into our system and I do not find anything. Do you have her birthday or SSN?
Thanks!

Hi - I hope you are staying safe and well! I just received a call from asking when she would hear from OVS. I sent her paperwork in several weeks ago. I wanted to see if anything is missing like the other one I reached out regarding last week.

Thank you for your help!
Stay well!

Good Afternoon,

I am not assigned to the  claim ( ). Right now in our system the claim is rejected for date of crime not listed. If you could please call  with Processing at  to firm up that missing information, and from there I believe the claim will be assigned to an investigator.

Good Afternoon,

I just wanted to follow up from the other day. I still haven't received any copy of the CJAR for [redacted] O. Maybe sending via mail is the best option? Again here are our fax numbers:

Good Afternoon,

I am reaching out to discuss a claim OVS is investigating for victims compensation. Notably, the course in which OVS may receive a copy of the CJ report relating to the dates of crime. I have CC'ed my supervisor  Brock on this email.
