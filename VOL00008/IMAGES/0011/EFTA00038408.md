Hi Bob- hope you are doing ok! I believe you were at the meeting in Miami where it was discussed that the FBI Victim Assistance would pay for up to six sessions of counseling for these victims. There is now for those victims that reside in Florida a cap of 12 counseling sessions; but all must be approved by the case agent prior to any sessions.

Please feel free to call my cell at [redacted] if you have any further questions.

Stay safe!
