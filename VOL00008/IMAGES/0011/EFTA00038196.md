Sorry to bother again with this. Do you mind sending another canvas out for this Friday 11/13? Showing discovery to Maxwell at MDC from 9am-3pm.

Thank you!

All,

Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to help out on Friday 11/6 from 8:00 am - 3:00 pm. You would have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would be shown to them.

Thanks,
