We're available tomorrow at 11 am Texas time. Is that time still good for you?

Hi [redacted].

I've thought about it, and I think I'd like to hear what the lawyers say before I agree to an interview, and for me to ask some questions etc.

I am available in the morning on Thursday at 6am TX time, or tomorrow morning at 11am TX time, or I can do a Wednesday morning time if those don't work?

Thanks!
