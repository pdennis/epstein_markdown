Sigrid- I'm sorry I was trying to find a time for us all three to chat but the time got away from me.

_________________________ - do you want to chat with Sigrid alone? If not what time can all three of us jump on a quick call tomorrow?

Sigrid- I am on a call with DOJ and discussing if there any alternative locations/ ways for victims to participate that can not travel. Can you give me the locations of your clients who would like to participate and unable to travel?

Thanks
