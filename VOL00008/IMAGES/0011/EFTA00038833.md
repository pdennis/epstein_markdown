Hey [REDACTED],

I just uploaded a bunch of the email tips sent over from SDNY. Kimberly helped me compile the list. Let me know if you come across any issues.

Hey [REDACTED],

Following up on the below—sorry for not thinking to ask about this earlier today. Let me know if you need any more info from me to get these email tips sent our way for the AUSAs to review.

Thanks so much,

Hey [REDACTED],

and [REDACTED] would like the emails for the SDNY leads in the updated Maxwell hotline spreadsheet. I've made a USAfx folder for them to be uploaded to, since it's probably too many to send via email:

[REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED]

If you could please help us get these together as soon as possible, that would be really helpful.

Thanks again,

[REDACTED]

Hope you're doing well. Do you have up-to-date copies of the tracking spreadsheets for the tipline/hotlines for Maxwell and Epstein that you could please send to me as soon as possible? I think the last ones we have from FBI are from last summer (one of which is attached) so just want to do extra due diligence on my end to make sure we have what we need to produce in 3500. If you could send those spreadsheets as soon as possible, that would be great.

Thank you,
