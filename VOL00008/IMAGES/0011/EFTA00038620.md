The attached item titled "Masseuses" was going to initially be a trial exhibit but was not used at the Maxwell trial. It was located on one of Epstein's digital devices seized from his Manhattan residence. The names listed are believed to be women and girls, some of which were identified minors, who were contacted by Epstein, Maxwell, and his staff to massage Epstein.

Separately, the black book was seized by Miami -Palm Beach during the course of their 72 investigation. It is an address book that included identified minors under "massage". Sections of this book were a trial exhibit.

The flight logs were kept and provided by Epstein's pilot [REDACTED]. This was a trial exhibit.

At trial, the black book and the flight logs had minor victims redacted from the public.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.
