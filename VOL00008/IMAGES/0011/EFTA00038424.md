Hi ladies,

This isn't urgent but I wanted to see if either of you could confirm whether or not [redacted] and/or [redacted] are victims in our case? We have invoices from a service provider, for them, but [redacted] and I don't recognize the names...they were not in attendance at our briefings which doesn't mean they aren't victims but we haven't seen email traffic on them aside from these invoices.

Can either of you confirm?

Thank you and hope you're both holding up ok. Stay safe!
