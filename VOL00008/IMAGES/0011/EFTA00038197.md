Hey,

Are either of you available to show this laptop again tomorrow at MDC same time frame as last time? I know tomorrow is a holiday so definitely understand if the answer is no. If you could let me know as soon as possible I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

We just finished, everything went smooth, and SA ___________ kept the computer, he will give it to you next week. Also, if you can send us the case number and if there is a file number I would really appreciate it so we can put it in our log.
Thank you and have a great weekend.
