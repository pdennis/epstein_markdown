Hi _______________.

Hope you're doing well. Do you have up-to-date copies of the tracking spreadsheets for the tipline/hotlines for Maxwell and Epstein that you could please send to me as soon as possible? I think the last ones we have from FBI are from last summer (one of which is attached) so just want to do extra due diligence on my end to make sure we have what we need to produce in 3500. If you could send those spreadsheets as soon as possible, that would be great.

Thank you,
