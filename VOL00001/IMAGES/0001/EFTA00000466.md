Dear Mr. Jeffrey Epstein

I hate that you got into this mess with these
goals over the years. These goals now what they
were doing you didn't put a gun to there head
out you have to watch it to; all rich people
are targets in this world people are going to come
at you to get a dollar. Women are really strong
it to the men on every level it seems and a
lot is justify in some cases. In your case you
really need to watch yourself you are a target
and you never should get yourself caught up in
this BS in the first place. You know these goals
would come at you in the long run and never
up your reputation you should or even that and go
after your pockets.
