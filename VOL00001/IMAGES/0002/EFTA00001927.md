# Our getaway

I hope you had a wonderful holiday season.

I moved the next day you sent me. It was beautiful, thank you very much. Christmas went well with my family. My sister and I went in to Arizona with our dad. I performed on you very well and I realize that the first year would not take him as great as it was for me and it not been for your father. The adventures to the Virgin Islands, Mad Rith Creek, Las Vegas and New Mexico have all made this a year to remember. My sister had a wonderful time on the Las Vegas and New Mexico trip and also when you flew her out to New York to visit me for the weekend. Growing me to stay in your apartment in Manhattan made my life so much easier and less stressful. It was very nice to have my own space where I could be quiet and draw without talking to anyone nor worrying about staying on family or other friends. It was also very kind of fun to help my friend Richardson. So why my mother in 19 was wonderful. I have not gotten to spend a considerable amount of time with her since I moved out. However the most wonderful thing you have done is push me to be my best and really think about my life. Thank you for everything you have done for me.

Sincerely,
