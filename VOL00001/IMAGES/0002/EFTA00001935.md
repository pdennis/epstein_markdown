moments I had in Africa thanks to you. Until we meet next time and I can tell you all story's I hope you can see the joy in my eyes when you look at the photos.

Once again, thank you so much, your kindness and care means the world to me.

My first night in Africa! This photo is taken by self-timer the first night when I arrived in Tanzania (the east coast) before traveling to the wildlife area. Selous where the Safari was.
