ear Jeffrey:
I hope you had a wonderful holiday season.

I received the next place you sent me. It was beautiful, thank you very much. Christmas went well with my family. My sister and I spent it in Arizona with our dad. I performed on new years with the circus in LA. Everything has been going well and I realize that the past year would not have been as great as it was for me, had it not been for your help. The adventures to the Virgin Islands, West Palm Beach, Las Vegas and New Mexico have all made this a year to remember. My sister had a wonderful time on the Las Vegas and New Mexico trip and also when you flew her out to New York to visit me for the weekend. Allowing me to stay in your apartment in Manhattan made my life so much easier and less stressful. It was very nice to have my own space where I could be quiet and draw without talking to anyone nor worrying about intruding on family or other friends. It was also very kind of you to help my friend Alexandra. Seeing my mother in LA was wonderful, I have not gotten to spend a considerable amount of time with her since I moved out. However, the most wonderful thing you have done is push me to be my best and really think about my life. Thank you for everything you have done for me.
