Dear Ghislaine,

I enjoyed writing Jeffrey a birthday letter and reminiscing about the past. However, if it is not what you had in mind, please feel free to edit it or tell me to write something else.

I hope you can use the photos. The ones of the Parachute Jump &amp; Wonder Wheel are icons from his childhood neighborhood. I thought you might find a place for them somewhere in the book.

I'm looking forward to seeing the finished book - it should be very interesting considering the many different people Jeffrey has encountered throughout his life.

Please keep in touch, and let me know what I can do to help.

Best regards,
Kathe
