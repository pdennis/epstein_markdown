Dear Shudine,

I enjoyed writing Gypsy a birthday letter and reintervening about the past. However, if it is not what your had in mind, please feel free to edit it. In all the 2 write something else. I hope you can use the photos. One ones of the Parachute pump &amp; wonder wheel are 100% from his childhood neighborhood. I thought you might find a place for them somewhere in the border.

In looking forward to seeing the finished look - it should be very interesting considering the many different people. Gypsy has encountered throughout the life.

Please keep in touch, and let me know what I can do to help best regards.
