Dear Jeffrey:

I have talked to you and Ghislaine on several occasions to say thank you. But, I wanted to express in writing my personal and professional gratitude for the very generous gift of $200,000 for a new scholarship lodge. It is truly an extraordinary gesture.

Under the charitable contribution act, you are permitted use of the lodge for two weeks each year, without any negative implications in respect to the full tax deductibility of your gift. Naturally, we would like you to visit the new lodge this summer. So that we might begin to book the lodge, I would ask you to consider what two weeks you would like reserved for your use. Perlman will be giving his concert on August 7, 1994. I have enclosed the appropriate tax code for your file.

Dear Ghislaine:

Enclosed is the envelope we recently found in cleaning the Epstein Lodge. Apparently it lodged between the wall and the dresser. It was not discovered until the unit was moved for cleaning.
