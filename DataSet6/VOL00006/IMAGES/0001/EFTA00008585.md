MS. [REDACTED]: Ladies and gentlemen, some of the testimony that you're going to hear today will include hearsay. As you know, that means that the witness will not be testifying solely from her own observations, but that she'll also be reporting what others have told her and what she's read in reports and documents prepared by others.

As you know, hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury proceedings, and you're free to rely on it in determining whether there is probable cause to indict the proposed defendant.

If, however, you would like to hear the testimony of any other witness, you have the right to request it, and we will make reasonable efforts to bring that witness before you.

BY MS. :

Q. So, Special Agent I placed in front of you a stack of exhibits. I want to talk through them now one by one.

We were discussing earlier that you recall testifying before this grand jury on June 18, 2019; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So, I placed in front of you what's marked as Grand Jury Exhibit 3. Is that a fair and accurate transcript of your testimony on that date?

A. Yes.

Q. I've also placed in front of you Grand Jury Exhibit 1. Is that a PowerPoint presentation that you reviewed with this grand jury on June 18th, 2019?

A. Yes.

Q. So picking up where we left off last time, I

want to follow up regarding the presentation. If you could turn to page 28 of that presentation.

Now, Special Agent [redacted] do you recall testifying about your interviews with a young woman named [redacted]?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you recall that there was a question from the grand jury about the date on one of the slides in this presentation?

A. Yes.

Q. Just want to follow up on that. So on this page, just to orient ourselves, do you recall testifying about phone records of a call between a phone number subscribed to [redacted] and [redacted]'s cell phone on January 3rd?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you reviewed the underlying phone records that are excerpted in this slide?

A. Yes.

Q. Is the call highlighted on this slide from January 3rd, 2005?

Q. Have you confirmed that the underlying records are, in fact, from January 3rd, 2005?
A. Yes.
Q. Turning to the next slide, on page 29. So the header on this slide is January 4, 2005. Is that the same date that's on the deposit slip excerpted in that slide?
A. Yes.
Q. So does the date on this slide accurately reflect the date on the deposit slip?
A. Yes.
Q. So when you testified that based on the phone records we just discussed and this deposit slip, that it appears that they were on back-to-back days, was that in fact accurate?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. So I want to switch gears now and ask you, do you recall testifying before this grand jury regarding a woman named [redacted]?
A. Yes.
Q. If you could turn now to what's before you and marked Grand Jury Exhibit 4. Do you recognize this?

appear to be left for Jeffrey Epstein.

Q. Taking a step back for a moment, how did the FBI obtain this document?

A. We received this from the Palm Beach Police Department.

Q. What is your understanding, based on your review of law enforcement reports and your review of the case file, of how the Palm Beach Police Department obtained this document?

A. They would have received it from a trash pull. So a trash pull is, one of the detectives had gone to the residence and went through the trash that was left on the curb.

Q. Is this document from one of those trash pulls?

A. Yes.

Q. Approximately when was this pulled from the trash, based on your review of law enforcement reports?

A. April 13, 2005.

Q. In a previous presentation, you discussed a number of residences. Do you know specifically where this was pulled from the trash?

A. The Palm Beach residence.

Q. Did you personally participate in gathering this evidence?

A. I was not a part of the trash pull, but I have received the evidence since.

Q. Let's turn to the fourth page of this document. Focusing on the last line, do you see where it says callers?
