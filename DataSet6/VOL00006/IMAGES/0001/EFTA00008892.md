Dear Jeffrey:

I have talked to you and Ghislaine on several occasions to say thank you. But, I wanted to express in writing my personal and professional gratitude for the very generous gift of $200,000 for a new scholarship lodge. It is truly an extraordinary gesture.

Under the charitable contribution act, you are permitted use of the lodge for two weeks each year, without any negative implications in respect to the full tax deductibility of your gift. Naturally, we would like you to visit the new lodge this summer. So that we might begin to book the lodge, I would ask you to consider what two weeks you would like reserved for your use. Perlman will be giving his concert on August 7, 1994. I have enclosed the appropriate tax code for your file.

Dear Ghislaine:

Enclosed is the envelope we recently found in cleaning the Epstein Lodge. Apparently it lodged between the wall and the dresser. It was not discovered until the unit was moved for cleaning.

Q. Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have identified as having been involved in three-way sexual activities, with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form and foundation.

A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was with him other than myself.

Q. I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that in the 1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein was having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself and the blond and brunette on those few occasions when they were involved with you?

A. That is my testimony, that is correct.
