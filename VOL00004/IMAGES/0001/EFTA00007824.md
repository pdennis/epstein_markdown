Box 1887, Birmingham, Alabama 35201-1887 as soon as possible. You may also contact us by going to www.colonialbank.com and clicking on "Contact Us."

We must receive notice from you no later than 30 days after the mailing date of your first statement on which the error or problem appeared. You may telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights and we may ask for you to put your complaint or question in writing. In your letter, please provide the following information:

1. Your name and account number.
2. The dollar amount and the date of the suspected error.
3. A description of the error and an explanation as to why you believe there is an error.

You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your account that are not in question. While we investigate, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount you have questioned.

### IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS (Consumer – Non-Business Accounts)

If you think your statement is wrong, if you need more information about electronic fund transfers (automated teller transactions, direct deposits, pre-authorized debits, Online Banking transactions, debit card transactions or other similar transactions), or if you need to verify a transaction, call or write us using the methods shown above. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. You may telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. Please provide the following information:

- Your name and account number.
- A description of the error or transfer you are unsure about and why you believe it is an error, or why you need more information.

However, if we need more time, we may take up to 45 calendar days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the additional time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing, and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. If we decide there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of our investigation. If we have provisionally credited your account, we will charge the amount back to your account. You may ask for copies of the documents that we use in our investigation.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If a notice of error involves an electronic fund transfer that was initiated in a foreign location, or was a point-of-sale debit card transaction, the time period allowed for our investigation is 90 calendar days. Or, if the suspected error or question involves a transaction that occurred within 30 days after the first deposit to a new account, we will have 20 business days to correct the suspected error or provisionally credit your account and 90 calendar days to investigate.

To report a lost or stolen ATM or Check Card, 24 hours a day, seven days a week – please call 877-502-2265.

However, if we need more time, we may take up to 45 calendar days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the additional time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing, and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. If we decide there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our findings within 3 business days after the conclusion of our investigation. If we have provisionally credited your account, we will charge the amount back to your account. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If a notice of error involves an electronic fund transfer that was initiated in a foreign location, or was a point-of-sale debit card transaction, the firm period allowed for our investigation in 90 calendar days. Or, if the suspected error or question involves a transaction that occurred within 30 days after the first deposit to a new account, we will have 20 business days to correct the suspected error or provisionally credit your account and 90 calendar days to investigate.

To report a lost or stolen ATM or Check Card, 24 hours a day, seven days a week – please call 877-502-2265.

We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. You may telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights.
