# Why is TED'S SHEDS your best value?

Direct questions from customers help explain the importance of quality in the selection of your portable storage building.

## "What should I look for in a quality shed?"

Integrated construction, using the most durable materials and engineered fasteners, will satisfy the State of Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) building code and provide the greatest strength and long lasting service. TED'S SHEDS feature:

![img-27.jpeg](img-27.jpeg)

- Framed construction of #2 grade Southern Yellow Pine, not light weight Spruce or Fir.
- Framing spaced in 16" or 24" increments, per customer preference.
- Heavy duty 4" x 6" corner post constructed of 3 – 2" x 4" studs with ½" plywood spacer for maximum strength and rigidity.
- Inside of siding coated white – for cleaner, brighter interior appearance (with most colors).

## "How will my shed hold up in Florida's climate?"

TED'S SHEDS most popular sheds are specifically designed for Florida's demanding environment. Key factors include:

![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)

- Aluminum siding is installed with stainless steel screws and WILL NOT RUST!
- Exclusive ridge vent, available to release heat through the roof.
- Mobile Home Door for a secure fit, – that will not rot or warp.
- Weather-seal around door and foam-seal around the sides and roof, to keep out bugs and blowing rain.
- Pressure treated sill plate, flooring, joists and skids to resist bugs and rot.

![img-29.jpeg](img-29.jpeg)

![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)

![img-31.jpeg](img-31.jpeg)

## "Does my shed meet Florida's hurricane codes?"

YES! TED'S SHEDS are engineered to comply with the State of Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) regulations. The sheds are engineered to withstand wind loads up to 150 m.p.h.!

- Installation includes heavy-duty "mobile home type" anchors.
- Skids are connected with hurricane clips to the floor joists.
- Wall studs are connected with galvanized steel straps to the floor and roof trusses.
- Galvanized steel truss plates are hydraulically installed.

![img-32.jpeg](img-32.jpeg)

![img-33.jpeg](img-33.jpeg)

![img-34.jpeg](img-34.jpeg)

## "Will my shed require much maintenance?"

Years of rigorous testing and field experience have led to TED'S SHEDS insistence on low maintenance construction details:

- Concrete foundation blocks, so skids don't contact the ground.
- 3/4" pressure treated, tongue and groove "Sturdi-Floor" plywood, not untreated, poor quality wood covered with paint or copper tox.
- Pressure treated 2" x 4" sill plates.
- Nails, not staples, are used to fasten the wood together.
