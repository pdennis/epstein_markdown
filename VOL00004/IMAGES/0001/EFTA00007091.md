RE: JEGE, Inc. (“JEGE”) and Hyperion Air, Inc. (“Hyperion”)

Dear _________________:

Thank you very much for your letter dated May 15, 2007 concerning the subpoenas issued to JEGE, Inc. and Hyperion Air, Inc., along with your agreement to extend compliance deadlines until May 29, 2007. I apologize for any confusion concerning representation created by my letter to you of May 10, 2007 on behalf of the corporations, and the subsequent telephone call you received from Lilly Ann Sanchez, also on behalf of the corporations.

Please be advised that I am working with Lily Ann Sanchez and Gerald B. Lefcourt in regard to these subpoenas. Accordingly, please feel free to speak to or communicate with myself, Ms. Sanchez and/or Mr. Lefcourt concerning matters related to the subpoenas.

Very truly yours,

JACK A. GOLDBERGER
