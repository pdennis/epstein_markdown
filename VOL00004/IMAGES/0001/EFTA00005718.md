Re: Grand Jury Subpoena

Please be advised that the accompanying grand jury subpoena has been issued in connection with an official criminal investigation of a suspected felony being conducted by a federal grand jury. The Government hereby requests that you voluntarily refrain from disclosing the existence of the subpoena to any third party. While you are under no obligation to comply with our request, we are requesting you not to make any disclosure in order to preserve the confidentiality of the investigation and because disclosure of the existence of this investigation might interfere with and impede the investigation.

Moreover, if you intend to disclose the existence of this subpoena to a third party, please let me know before making any such disclosure.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Very truly yours,

GEOFFREY S. BERMAN

# Advice of Rights

1. You may refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question would tend to incriminate you.

2. Anything that you do say may be used against you by the grand jury or in a subsequent legal proceeding.

3. If you have a lawyer, the grand jury will permit you a reasonable opportunity to step outside the grand jury room to consult with your lawyer if you so desire.

4. If you would like a lawyer but do not have funds to retain one, you may make an application to the United States Magistrate Judge who will decide whether to appoint a lawyer to represent you.
