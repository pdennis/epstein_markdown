Palm Beach, FL 33480

Dear Jeffrey,

I previewed this house last week. Appropriate for you – off Brattle Street, short walk to Harvard Square, very good condition which is remarkable for most Cambridge properties.

If you wish to view property between Tuesday the 20th and Saturday the 24th call Gail Roberts at [redacted] and set up a time with her assistant [redacted]. I will return to Boston on the 24th and can show property after that time. Any questions call me at [redacted].

Sincerely
