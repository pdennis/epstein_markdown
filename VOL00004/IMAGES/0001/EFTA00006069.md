Refund. Even if you do not have to file a tax return, you should file to get a refund if box 2 shows federal income tax withheld or if you can take the earned income credit. Earned Income credit (EIC). You must file a tax return if any amount is shown in box 9.

You may be able to take the EIC for 2005 in (a) you do not have a qualifying child and you earned less than $11,750 ($13,750 if married filing jointly), (b) you have one qualifying child and you earned less than $31,030 ($33,030 if married filing jointly), or (c) you have more than one qualifying child and you earned less than $35,263 ($37,263 if married filing jointly). You and any qualifying children must have valid social security numbers (SSNs). You cannot take the EIC if your investment income is more than $2,700. Any EIC that is more than your tax liability is refunded to you, but only if you file a tax return. If you have at least one qualifying child, you may get as much as $1.597 of the EIC in advance by completing Form W-5, Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate, and giving it to your employer.

Clergy and religious workers. If you are not subject to social security and Medicare taxes, see Publication 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers.

Corrections. If your name, SSN, or address is incorrect, correct Copies B, C, and 2 and ask your employer to correct your employment record. Be sure to ask the employer to file Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to correct any name, SSN, or money amount error reported to the SSA on Form W-2. If your name and SSN are correct but are not the same as shown on your social security card, you should ask for a new card at any SSA office or call 1-800-772-1213.

If you had more than one employer in 2005 and more than $5,580.00 in social security and/or Tier I railroad retirement (RITA) taxes were withheld, you may be able to claim a credit for the excess against your federal income tax. If you had more than one railroad employer and more than $2,943.60 in Tier II RITA tax was withheld, you also may be able to claim a credit.
