SOME COMPLAINTS FROM PATRONS THAT THE SHOW IS THE SAME AS LAST YEAR'S; OTHERS COMPLAINING THAT THE SHOW IS "SOPHOMORIC" "AND AMATURISH". THEY WANTED THEIR MONEY BACK.

HOUSEKEEPING NEEDED MORE STAFF AS FOOD AND DRINKS WERE ALLOWED IN AND THE TURN-AROUND TIME WAS SHORT, AND HK WAS TOLD NOT TO ENTER HOUSE BETWEEN SHOWS. COUPLE WAS UPSET: HUSBAND WAS ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN FINAL DISAPPEARING ACT; AT END OF SHOW, WIFE GOT VERY UPSET BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T FIND HIM. HUSBAND GOT VERBALLY UPSET AT COPPERFIELD MANAGER BACKSTAGE, MADE A SCENE, AND HAD TO BE ESCORTED OFF PREMISES BY FLPD. REST ROOMS WERE NOT ADEQUATELY ATTENDED TO AFTER SHOW, AS HOUSEKEEPING WAS SHORT STAFFED.
