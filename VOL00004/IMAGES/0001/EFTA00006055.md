## Sexual Assault

Sexual Assault is a violent crime including rape, incest, sexual harassment or any other sexual contact without consent.

Per Florida Statute 90.5035, a victim of sexual violence who consults a sexual assault counselor at a rape crisis center has the right to confidentiality of information shared with the counselor.

No one except the victim can compel the sexual assault counselor to reveal information about their communications. Only the victim can waive the privilege, and this must be done in writing.

If rape victims are not sure whether to report to law enforcement, victim advocates will assist them through their decisionmaking process, respecting whatever choices are made.

## Certified Rape Crisis Victim Advocates Will Provide:

- Crisis Intervention and Personal Advocacy
- Accompaniment during forensic rape exams at The Butterfly House and other medical facilities
- Coordination of follow-up medical care, therapy and referrals
- Criminal Justice advocacy and court accompaniment

## Start by Believing

## YOUR REACTION MAKES THE DIFFERENCE.

## Domestic Assault

Domestic Assault involves power and control tactics such as physical violence, emotional abuse, sexual violence, economic abuse, and isolation.

### Victim Advocates Will Provide:

- Crisis Intervention
- Safety Planning
- Assistance with filing Restraining Orders
- Safe-Shelter Referrals
- Personal and legal advocacy during criminal justice proceedings

## Homicide and Other Violent Crimes

Homicide and other violent crimes shatter the lives of injured victims and survivors causing severe emotional trauma and grief.

Help is Available

![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)

Victims of sexual crimes need compassion, sensitivity and empathy. Being the victim of a crime can be overwhelming. Your reactions are normal. Local certified rape crisis centers have advocates who are there to help all victims, regardless of whether or not they report to law enforcement. Services are free and confidential – certified rape crisis centers are legally and ethically required to protect your confidentiality, unless you allow, in writing, the release of your information. Advocates are available to:

- Provide crisis intervention
- Speak to you on the 24-hour hotline
- Discuss your options
- Navigate available resources
- Go with you to appointments
- Address safety concerns
- Advocate on your behalf
- Help you apply for victim compensation

# Sexual Battery is a Crime!

![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)

In Florida, the legal term for rape or sexual assault is sexual battery (F.S. 794.011). Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object, committed without your consent.

Consent means intelligent, knowing, and voluntary consent and does not include coerced submission. Failure to offer physical resistance to the offender does not imply consent.

A person under 16 years of age cannot legally consent to sex. Also, a person 24 years of age or older or a person in a familial or custodial position of authority cannot receive consent from 16 and 17 year old minors.

# Forensic Exam

![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

## What is a forensic exam?

The forensic exam is a head-to-toe exam to collect evidence and check for injuries after a sexual crime.

## What are my rights with regard to the exam?

- Stop the exam at any time
- Have an advocate from a rape crisis center with you
- Be informed about the status of the kit during processing

## What evidence is collected?

During the exam, the medical professional may collect blood, urine, saliva, pubic hair combings and/or nail samples. They may also collect items of your clothing. They will ask you questions about the crime and your medical history in order to help them collect evidence.

## What happens to the evidence?

If you make a report to law enforcement, your kit will be sent to the regional or statewide lab within 30 days for testing. The lab is required to process the kit within 120 days.

If you don't report the crime to law enforcement at the time you obtain the exam, your kit will be stored anonymously. Your kit may be stored for only a limited time, depending on your community's storage space. The local rape crisis center can advise you about the storage timelines in your community.

**Criminal History Record Check:** In order for compensation to be considered, the victim or applicant must not have been confined or in custody in a county or municipal facility; a state or federal correctional facility; or a juvenile detention commitment, or assessment facility; adjudicated as a habitual felony offender, habitual violent offender, or violent career criminal; or adjudicated of a forcible felony offense.

**Notice of Payment Limitations:** The Bureau of Victim Compensation may provide financial assistance for eligible persons, but only after all other sources of payment have been exhausted. Payments accepted by in-state providers on behalf of victims are considered payment-in-full per Florida Statute. Total victim compensation benefits cannot exceed the maximum award amount determined by the current benefit payment schedule. Limits below the maximum may apply to specific benefits, which may be reduced without prior notice to the award recipient based on the availability of funding.

**Acceptable Proof of Crime:** The Bureau of Victim Compensation does not make an independent judgment on whether a compensable crime occurred, but instead relies on proof of crime from the proper authorities. Failure to provide acceptable documentation proving that a compensable crime occurred shall result in your application not being processed or your claim being denied. Acceptable documentation includes: a law enforcement report or charging affidavit from a child protection team, law enforcement agency, state or prosecuting attorney, or the Department of Children and Families that affirms a compensable crime occurred; an indictment by a grand jury; an indictment by a prosecutor from a court of competent jurisdiction; a report from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation; or a Florida Department of Law Enforcement cybercrime investigator certification of a crime for purposes of Section 960.197, F.S.

**Complete Application Package:** It is your responsibility to provide a complete application package which includes acceptable documentation proving that a crime occurred. If the department receives a report which is insufficient for proving that a compensable crime occurred, the application will be assigned a claim number and denied. Claim numbers assigned are not indicative of eligibility or denial. For assistance with collecting acceptable documentation, please contact your local law enforcement agency, the agency where the crime was reported, the referral source, or your local State Attorney's Office.
