The following investigation was conducted by SA [redacted].

On 08/27/2007 at approximately 8:26 AM, this writer received a telephone call from SA [redacted]. SA [redacted] advised she had just been notified that Jeffrey Epstein's private plane, bearing tail number N909JE, was due to take off from St. Thomas' airport, Cyril E. King Airport, within the next five minutes. This writer advised SA [redacted] he would make some phone calls to see if he could have the flight delayed while he responded to the airport.

At approximately 8:27 AM, this writer then contacted [redacted], Federal Security Director, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, United States Virgin Islands. This writer asked if there was any way to delay a flight from taking off due to the possibility of that flight bearing targets of interest in a criminal investigation. [redacted] advised the only way he could delay a flight if there was a threat to the safety of the flight. This writer informed Duffy this case did not meet that criteria. [redacted] then provided this writer with the phone number to Air Traffic Control (ATC).

This writer then contacted ATC ( [redacted] or [redacted]) and spoke with [redacted] (the code name used by the individual working at the tower). I identified myself to [redacted], and asked him the status of the flight for [redacted]. [redacted] advised the plane had filed a flight plan that showed estimated departure as being four minutes prior to our conversation. [redacted] advised the plane was still processing through customs at this time. I asked [redacted], if he had the capability of delaying the flight due to the plane possibly transporting targets of interest in a criminal investigation. [redacted] advised he could delay the flight a few minutes by informing the pilot of our approach, should the pilot request permission to take off prior to my arrival.

This writer then departed for Cyril E. King Airport. While in route to the airport, this writer contacted SST [redacted], FBI St. Thomas, and requested she contact United States Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and inform them of my impending arrival. This writer then contacted SA [redacted] and informed her of my departure to the airport.

At approximately 8:44 AM, this writer received a telephone call from [redacted] Supervisor, CBP. This writer told [redacted] there were possibly two female targets getting ready to

EFTA00007151

take off on the aforementioned plane. [REDACTED] told this writer to meet him at the cargo entrance of the airport.

Upon arriving at the airport's cargo entrance, this writer was met by [REDACTED] and two of his co-workers. This writer followed [REDACTED] to the aforementioned plane, which was parked in a waiting area with the engines off. This writer showed [REDACTED] and his co-workers the picture of the two female targets and explained the purpose was to serve the two females with target letters. [REDACTED] stepped away and went to speak with the pilot of the aircraft. This conversation between [REDACTED] and the pilot occurred out of this writer's range of hearing. [REDACTED] returned and advised the pilot informed him that Epstein was the only passenger scheduled on this flight. [REDACTED] informed me he was going to check the plane as part of their custom's check and asked me to accompany him. [REDACTED] advised they had the legal authority to board any aircraft going to the United States. I boarded the plane along with [REDACTED] and the other two CBP personnel. We walked the length of the plane and ascertained there was no one on board. We then disembarked the plane. [REDACTED] had one of his personnel go into the airport to ensure the female targets were not present inside the terminal. The CBP officer returned and advised Epstein was alone and was still processing through customs.

At Approximately 8:55 AM, this writer contacted [REDACTED] at ATC. This writer told [REDACTED] the plane had been checked. [REDACTED] advised he did not have to delay the plane or take any action to delay the flight as the pilot never requested permission to take off.

At Approximately 8:59 AM, this writer contacted SA [REDACTED] and informed her Epstein was traveling alone. SA [REDACTED] advised she had just obtained that information from another source.

NOTE: All times referenced in this insert were taken from this writer's cellular telephone call history.
