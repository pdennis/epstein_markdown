Re: Richard Taus
91A1040

Dear Ms. [REDACTED]

Please be advised that I have represented Richard Taus who is currently an inmate at Clinton Correctional Facility. By way of background Richard Taus is a former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the Vietnam War. Richard Taus has informed me he believes he possesses important information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein along with information regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and he possesses relevant information to an individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison.

I am respectfully requesting as a former Assistant United States Attorney and a present practicing attorney that you utilize your good office to interview Richard Taus who seeks to lend you assistance in this investigation. It is my respectful opinion that Robert possesses important and vital information that can assist in the interest of justice.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

Respectfully submitted,

Anthony V. Lombardino
